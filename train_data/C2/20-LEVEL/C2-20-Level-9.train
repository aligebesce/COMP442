Point nought one.
Point nought two.
Point nought two sorry .

Okay.
"That's, that's   Now when you've got an A squared minus B squared, you can factorize that I mean you could just do that on your calculator, and do it in one go, but it's quite easy to do it as  three point O one."
"A plus B, times A minus B. Okay?"
So three point nought one plus two point nine is point nought two.

That's what containers do don't they?
They seal containers and export it to different er  ratio.
"But the cubic idea is the same, but it's six point six  cu , kilos per cubic foot."
So a metre would be  about three  it's a cubic metre.
We'll work on that one.
"Gotta be nine ,"
Nine.

Nine.
cubic metres in a
metres
yard.
"About the same sa , in ten."

Mum?
"I would have, you said she's calling here to pick it up er, isn't she?"
Yes.

"Yeah, who?"
"Neil was there, Chris was there, Wayne was there, a few others."
"I thought, I thought that Matthew  was"
"No he's not there, he's skint!"
God he's spent  he's spent all his grant hasn't he?
God!
He's gonna get into some awful trouble isn't he?
Mm.
"I mean, he's nearly as  as overdrawn as Sophie and she's, she's nearly completed her course!"
I know!
He just hasn't got a clue though!
He doesn't care yo hasn't got a clue!
He must be worried about it though?
Surely he must be worried?
"Well I was talking to him about it, I said I reckon you've spent the  you've spent quite a bit now so you might as well just go another  get final ."
Three years!
Three year course!
I know !
"And he  can't   he usually works in the Bistro in Padsdown, he couldn't work in there to repay it!"
Because when he's in there his wage packets are like minus fifteen pounds when he's in there!
Why?
Because he spends it all!
So really he's got to get a job which is gonna  pay the majority of it off.
But I'll be down at dad's till ti till September.
"Come up here, then up to Heathrow Airport."
When are you going  to
dad's?
"Well, I'll ask Ian, they, they might not have told us, because, I don't know, they would have told us, wouldn't they?"
They should do really.

"They give you a booklet for each subject, and I've got a list, a lec a lecture every week, until February, when it just says reading week."
"Oh, perhaps you have got leave."
It does seem odd.
Claire has a lot longer term than us.
"I think it's ridiculous, really."
Mine are twelve week terms.
"I think ours is only eleven, that's what we was told."
Mine are twelve.
"I thought it was thirteen, was it?"
"Twelve, twelve and twelve."
Could be.
"No, it's not, it's not as long as thirteen."
Yours is on eight.
You got an eight week term.
"Yeah, we've got an eight week term, the last term's eight weeks."
So long to Christmas.
Cos your the last ones  aren't you?
Mm.
What was I saying?
"Seems odd, I'm sure he showed me, he showed me a reading week before Christmas."
That's like what I think mine says.
Tight.
I'm sure we should.
Mind you
"I'll ask him, cos he'll know."
Perhaps I  I should.
"Yeah, it is due, I'm sure it's due."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah!
The fridge had mould in it!
All what?
I mean we're talking about
a thing that's been used for a couple of months!
Yeah.
"Then he came in  er   sort of  right at the end said, well look, I'm so cheesed off with you lot"

"She said, look  let me know, how much it's going to cost me to get rid of this, because I've had enough!"
And we've only just bought it !
Well
So er
"June , last year."
"June , yes."
And so er
He came back

They won't quote any
Oh!
price!
They quote anything!
"So you find you're, you're on your own!"
Yeah.
"And erm  you know, if we pay up"
Everything is
it's cost a fortune to actually the caravan sited  pay out six thousand quid right?
"And then, you have to let it out then."
No dad don't want it
it might make him feel sick.
"Well when you finish your tea, just have a tiny bit."
"No I really don't want to mate, I really don't want to  you enjoy it."
Cor look at that one!
Dad was gonna ring you up at eight o'clock  before you went to school  and say
What for?

Oh!
"He said yo it's terrible in here he said, it really is, he said I've never known such catty  in all my life!"
What is catty then?
Well   right old bitches they are!
"Well they come from the right area, don't they?"
Yeah.
Let's face it.
That's right.
You can't get any worse than that can you?
No  cos whenever we go in there  they're always moaning if Cliff starts singing or something.

Coming down the er  the old church highway towards the house  from town er the white arrows in the road
You've gotta keep off them.

"I was I was, I was slightly banked at the time."
Mm.
Just very slightly.
You w if your d wheel does move it won't move far.
"You get used to that, the wheel  moving over a bit."

So we're just making little trips as we run out of stuff.
Mm.
Good idea.
"And see how, if that will work out any better."
Yeah.
Well  the good news for the environmentalists is the bike runs on unleaded.

Which is good news.
Cos like that's  not so expensive.
"So, I shall have to take it to the petrol station in a minute."

No we'll just pocket the money.
But you said that they buy
"Yes, but they sell, you can buy"
I doubt it.
"articles, but they sell them back again."
And like I went down for that one Monday.
Yeah.
"And erm, I knew he was going to prison."
It was for something that happened about five or six years ago.
"He was in a fight with these erm, squatters."
Really?
And it's taken all this time to come round.
"Yeah, yeah, and now it's come round"
Three years.
"Three years  er  three years, five years if he misbehaves, and Clayton,you say, eighteen."
Yeah
Two years if he's good.
Bloody hell.
"I mean, he's been into court but not for that long."
"It's more of a shock, because, yeah, I know, because nobody knew."
"We thought he would just get like a, a community service"
from Lee.
I don't know.
I didn't know from Lee.
"Jim phoned me up and told me, he was like upset."
"Oh, shit."
Oh dear.
"it's sad though, because"
What has his mates done.
We're collecting loads of things for him to keep him occupied.
"Like drawing books and that, and pencils,you buy him trains and stuff."
"What a waste of time, cos he'll only sell them for things he"
"Yeah, course he will."
"It's like, it's ge you know, he's really upset about it, but I'm just thinking"
Be different if you can do that.
Yeah.
"Yeah, he's really upset, I feel sorry for him, cos he's been upset about it, but"
Tt!
Oh !
See Mr  last night.
Mm mm.
Did you?
Oh that's nice.
Yeah.
I don't think the prospect cheers Jane up particularly but  What are you doing?
I don't know that I've even seen that .
He gets frustrated when he can't win though.
Yeah but don't we all.
"I mean, that isn't just a function of their age"
Yeah.
it's a function of age you er
"I know, but it gets him depressed."
"I know, but er, Jane goes through the same, I can't remember things."
Oh!
"I should be able to do this and that but, but it happens."
"It's just as you get older I think you, you begin to notice it more because your conscious of  your faculties not being there."
"Anyway, erm  but, but with John he wo he will, he'll get really uptight, he won't erm"
I don't even think it .
Alright?
Anything else?
Are you taking your car?
Cos if you are I'll have to move mine.
We'll take whichever one we can get out quick Julie.
"Erm, Jane's'll be  easy."
"Mind you, I've erm  far enough forward to be able to get"
Oh!
We'll manage.
Will you?
I'll see.
Varying degrees is it?
Yeah Phillips usually put two of these on but  Right-y-o blast off.

That's a bit more like it.
Cor yeah.

Yeah  that's right.
"You can always get  twenty five quid off the trade    double your money, quick easy money."
Yeah.
That's not a bad  is it really?bit of blue perhaps  bit more like it innit?
Ooh.
"Cor, fair near jumps out at you."
Compared to what it was it's bloody brilliant innit ?
She'll be well pleased with that.
Yeah it was a big  over to the main  you know that
"and had a look at the, the  but  Right, whereabouts  down there"
Erm
Oh it's down there
That there
Ah

That's that  actually I'll do I'll do th no I've just been round most of those.
I'll do this end as well I think  be on the safe side.
I've been right round the lot anyway so that's  jolly good.
"over a period of time can you,"
Yes that's it .
I think some do.
"Yeah,"
Did you say it's from out of town this one?
industrial estate  she lives down  somewhere.
"That twenty three pound odd what we had to pay, they said we should pay nothing."
Oh you're gonna pay
"Anything to do with the crash, we don't pay nothing for it."
So everything that we've got to pay out we invoice them
Mm.
they deduct it and send us it.
And that's what we've been doing.
Oh.
"So it weren't bad, especially  the money back."
pulling their hair out once they get cheque.
You what?
They'll be pulling their hair out once
It's their own fault.
Yeah.
"They should've made arrangements, we phoned up, asked them if we could take it in."
That were on  Tuesday we phoned up.
What's the matter ?
You going on holiday?

Yeah.
Go camping.
Haven't got a tent.
you'd ordered everything
no
Sorry.
I only need a bit.
"I can get some from er  Chester perhaps, for what I want you know?"
"So er  how often does this  do they go to  then, how often is this order?"
Is it
Er this is just one that  I wanted some stuff and I said to a few people
Oh you went round?
"I see, yeah."
and they're delivering it.
I've actually  the last time I got some delivered for me was February  so I tend to sort of get something about once a month I think.
Mm
"It really depends what I'm doing, if I'm doing a lot of   stuff, then I don't need"
Yeah
to go because I've got all the hair
Loads yeah
But at the moment I seem to have done a lot of  stuff with foam so
"I tend to forget, me, honest to god I think I've  plenty and then you come to the  you say oh god  you know  it's  never mind."
Well next time I'll remember you.
"Next time if you'd ask me, and I still won't know."
Half past twelve!
"I might as well go through on this, I was gonna go in that one."
Yeah
"I'll, I'll go, this fellow's moving now so I'll go in there."
So you've got a big garden have you Arth?
"Oh, no"
Oh.
got a  decent size back garden.
"Mine is, yes yes, yeah."
It's er Birkenhead you live is it?
I live in
So here we've got
This is less than one.
squared.
squared it gets smaller and smaller.
So that's going to be nought point four.
Mm.
So the gradient at that point is about two.
Erm what wh where were we  where did I say find the gradient?
Where X equal to three?
Yeah.
Sorry  something wrong that.
"So we'd be, oh, okay, that's good cos you can do it."
When X is three?
"So when X is two point nine, say."
"Two point nine, and then"
Y
when X  one see what Y is down here.
It was three point one.
"Don't forget you can look at this, Y equals X plus one times X minus one, which, when you see it that way tells you where it's going to, where its roots are."
Where it's going to cut the axes.
Yeah.
X  So there Y will be two point nine plus times two point nine minus one.
Right.
"Which is three point nine times nought point nine,"
Okay.
"But f we can, we can, we can save that to the end because  I think that was"
Aye.
confusing probably wasn't it?
"When we're doing it this way, we can forget about the, with this X, X two is going to be three point one squared"
Minus one .
minus one.
"This one is going to be two point nine squared, minus one."
We compromised.
Okay.
Here's Mr .
You better get your head down  Wesley.
"When we used to sit with you in Humanities  sat next to you right, and I was saying like erm  erm, you were saying  I got you to say  so who are gonna bring down the school to beat me up?"
And we got on this subject.
And I said no one.
And you said you bring the mother-fuckers down.
And I got you talking about all the porno magazines.
We got all that on tape.
Have you had it all lesson?
Yeah I've still got it.

I've brung it into school loads of times.
Have you still got everything?
Yeah.

No he were younger than that.
"I can remember that, he come over and told me."
"How did you get them all black mum, I said  they're bloody new ones ."
Not now.
Mm.
I want a new frying pan.
I keep using me best pan.
"I ain't got no best pans, I've had my pa most of my pans, they've all near enough come from either Embassy cigarette coupons or Number Six coupons, and I've still got them and I've had some of them twenty bloody years, all them pans."
Have you?
You know when we saved them Berkeley packets?
Yeah.
Can you remember what we saved them for?
"Marion asked me other day what we were saving them for, I said well we saved them  oh I remember!"
"We saved them, they were on about cameras and that and then we found out inserts inside it that  you got it with that didn't you?"
"Well it was, it was, yeah yeah."
Yeah.
I've still got stacks of them in kitchen.

Oh we did send for something  but I can't remember what.
She got one.
You know like we got?
What did I send off to get Gary them radio earphones?

Oh.
"You know them that we got to send off for that, I got head bag and you got that?"
Yeah.
"Well I s I were saying to Irene, I says did you ever get one?"
Mm.
She says yeah I'm sure we did
Mm.
"No, it's a can't be in the garden, can he."
Yeah.
Same as with these next door.
I get right upset about Paddy.
"I mean she's give his kennel away now, and he's got no kennel again."
Ar.
"And he's running streets, and you know how cold it was last week, and he's running streets."
"What she give kennel away for, then."
I don't bloody know.
I think she'd give the dog away as well.
Saw him coming.
"Don't lick, don't let him lick her, Karen."
Don't lick.
You mutt
all right.
I've been round me mums this morning.
I expect I'll go.
Yeah.

"She said, when I went round she was sat doing crossword on bed."
"And then, er, I said I've just come to see if you want any cigs."
"She said, well our John's coming down tonight, she said, just get me twenty."
"I said, you might as well get forty, I said, because if he's late coming down"
"Yeah, right."
"And he can't round shop after, you'd be stuck, and I mean, he."
"I don't  Albert don't mind going for her cigs, but it's just that we don't get up early in the morning, you know, and if me mum's ringing at eight o'clock in the morning, 'cos she got no cigs."
"It's a bit unfair like, when when she could at"
I said  she said after my job at
Margaret's not very well.
she hadn't seen Margaret since Christmas Eve.
"Yeah, but she ain't been bad since Christmas Eve."
"Oh, no."
a vehicle from anybody else cos I think he's messed
That's right
everybody up there!
I tell you  I think he owe  a lot of money.
But can you   him?
Well we've got a tenner to go have we?
"but I ain't had chance to say to you, but I was saying to  cos when I called in and see   you think about it  he"
He was desperate to get there  desperate!
Absolutely
Yeah.
desperate!
Now he's never ever offered to pay that fifty odd quid.
Not till today.
"Yes so   and I reckon  quite frankly cos he's living on that lay by up the end  and I reckon he was hiding, do a runner or something or he ain't up to something no good!"
Well he weren't gonna have my vehicle.
He's such a devious little tyke!
Yeah.
I even got Ken to try it on us.
Did you read them that couple in there?
He had what?
"He had Ken over by the allotments, when he used to stay in the car"
for a couple of weeks rent.
"And he went out to pay,first place."
Yeah.
That's how he was in the first place though.
So the young  he was
Jonathan!
he really had me !
Why don't you sit on the pouffe and let grandma sit there.
Yeah I'm alright.
There's a place there!
No  I'm alright !
the aerial off  the car hasn't he?
Snapped it?
Mm.
Well if he's snapped it the aerial
I don't know whereabouts it's snapped.
though innit?
probably snapped it and
If Steve's going to have electric aerial he'll be doing the same thing.
He never ever puts them down.
Or is it his C B aerial?
The C B one  says I've only just let you have it!
He's forgot it's there .
"He's not had much sleep though, poor sod."
You've got a spare bedroom you know.
He won't sleep in it cos I won't sleep in it.
What's up with you  why?
It's still got everything chucked on it.
Well
It was emptying but it's started filling up again.
Yeah.
"Now we got our drier other day, it come through."
Ah did it?
Yeah.
"We can dry  dry now, I just leave it, I leave both doors shut and it keeps kitchen warm."
Yeah they do.
Yes.
"But you've gotta watch the con mind you it won't make no difference, condensation, will it?"
Yeah they don't half make kitchen warm though.
Mm.
I used to have one but he got fed up of me using it so he cut plug off
Ah
and we ended up selling it .
Oh  in  decent state  he didn't last time I scrubbed  well I wou
go on Monday?
No.
Oh.
Yeah well they sho I said I'd  I was looking through this
Mm
"and I was thinking cor  we say we haven't been doing very well, but look at that week there!"
And then  look  it's not
Yeah.
"too bad for this time of  I bet we're doing better this year, this time of the year than we did last."
Yeah  .
"Well you see you  do that minibus want cleaning up, that blue one  or was that clean before we put it in the shed?"
"No  that's  part of the   the windows washing but I'll  quickly washed over them  just to spruce them up a bit but I thought if I put Mrs  in that, is she driving, or is she not?"
"Erm, I should imagine so."
"Yes, she is."
Is she?
Don't she like the column change?
No.
Oh God!
Well I can't help it.
"Well you'll just have to explain to her, the other one"
Yeah.
hasn't come back after you've
"Well no , no what I'm saying was, the fifteen seaters here you see but  I can't, I shan't be  put the petrol in for the both shall I?clean tomorrow night."
Well I don't know what time she's picking it up at actually.
Oh.
I should imagine that's his number.
What number?
I hope he paid you this week then.
"Yeah,."
Well you  with his money you can pay off them two bills.
Yeah.
But I think he's  I don't think he's misformed at all.
Misformed?
That's not quite the way to say it !
Deformed.
Deformed.
Misformed !
He is!
You think he's deformed don't you?
"No, I don't think he's deformed!"
Of course he's not deformed!
He's lovely!
"Very, very  actually I think."
Did you see him dive yesterday?
"The bit where he like jumping on the lake  they've cut away  a bit of the platform so the only way you can do it is jump onto this bit of wood then fly, and literally he was like that, just going  in mid air and landed right in the water!"
He's nuts!
Blinking !
Bit cold for that innit?
"No, it was gorgeous yesterday wasn't it?"
Yeah.
And it's very
You and Brian  were loving it!
"Brian said not too much today Matt,I thought bloody hell what do you think I am!"
Telling me to walk across!
Is that what he said ?
Yeah.
He's worse that I am !
"Both of you, you're both saps!"
Don't let him go in the water it's too cold!
That's rubbish!
Dogs don't feel that!
At night  see he can't leave him alone he sits there and he goes  or something like that and jumps on him and gives him a    I can't keep my hands off that dog!
Ah ah ah!
That the caravan is cleaned.
It's got to be he says.
He said because people  leave their dirty things and beds and all this kind of thing.
He said we cannot allow that.
Well you can understand that.
"Yes, well he knows from experience."
Yes.
He said we can't allow people .
"He said if something like this got out, he said, we'd be out of business."
He said and do you know that we're a multi- million pound organization.
"Of course, of course ."
Mm?
He said we're not .
So I said well  a couple approached my wife here on  on Saturday.
I said and they're very happy and ninety nine percent of the people on this site are happy.
Solid like.
And I said I  you tell me if I'm happy.
"Cos you've gotta convince me now, this morning, or my caravan's going off here."
"I said and before you start  that the caravan can't go for four years,on this tape."
Did he listen to it?
Oh yes.
Bring that here.
chicken or is it
It's chicken.
"I don't want no chicken, I just want the chips."
Do you want some lamb then?
No I just want some chips.
If you'd rather have the lamb I'll have chicken.
No no.
I just want some chips.
Do you want tea?
I'll have coffee please.
Where are they going to?
"I don't know, they're loa , looks like they're loading them in, they're putting them in the gar the school."
Has that school closed now?
I think perhaps it has.
I went there for a week.
"Yeah, I think it's closed."
Didn't I?
"I was in the fourth year, the top year ."
"Were they nice to you there, the teachers?"
I mean there weren't very many teachers anyway were there?
How many were there?
Dunno.
Three or four.
Four?
Three or four?
Don't know.
Can't remember.
on the computer most of the time.
And I took part in some of their tests.
I got better results than some of the actual  fifteen year olds.
That'll be quite good about your maths test won't it?
"Cos you'll be, you're doing it again with, like that aren't you?"
Your maths
you're taking class nine
Yeah.
you could get better than them.
Yeah.
"Virtually every year the eighth, eighth year always does get better than the ninth year."
Look  that house is really old.
Look it's got the plaque on it.
What's a plaque mean?
Is that a fire station thing?
You alright?
Yeah.
Are you gonna go in to erm  Walton End or are you
Yes.
gonna leave that until afterwards ?
After what?
After your hair.
No.
No.
Don't back up will you else you'll slice my head off.
Well what's so funny about mum having her head sliced off?
He just did.
. He just backed up.
He did?
Perhaps he used his wing mirror.
Like I do.
That's a quite nice little  place there.
And you don't pay over the odds prices because it's not an expensive place to  have your shop.
Oh.
That's good.
You go to these big stores and they pay so much in heating and lighting and staff .
This er pavement's quite nice  .
Isn't it attractively done?
Done like parquet.
Don't know who's paying for it all  whether  council is  or what?
So do you want to go over there first?
It's up to you.
What do you want to do?
I don't mind a bit.
"Well we've got fifteen minutes, well thirteen minutes."
Beautiful cakes.
Fruit crumble.
"Yo you can't put it in that he said, it's brand new!"
"That'll be alright  so cos he slid his  my brief case  and er I got all the way home, no problem at all, I'd got newspaper under the back, so it didn't scratch the back  when I come to  come down Mill Road  this lorry's go , I mean I got the tail gate up  and er  I sort of looked in the mirror, I thought oh my goodness my tail gate, I could hear it so   and I braked a bit sharp and that slid down  and scratched along the dash board!"
Oh dear!
"Trying to get it out , sort of plastic dash went creeeh!"
Cor!
This  lintel!
That went right across there  but   well I suppose  .
Well I imagine there is.
Yeah.
Mum?
I wanna play a game.
Alright then  I'm sorry that's not in there.
Mum!
Well it don't matter we'll probably be able something out the sale anyway.
"Yeah you can get it, yeah."
"Mum,"
Yeah that's right.
take up.
What?
Er
No.
.
Oh  oh  didn't look.
"Anyway I'd better go, I'll see, well if I don't see you before I'll see you next Wednesday"
For my birthday.
then won't I?
"Yep, so what time is it, half past six is it, or do you want me  quarter past six was it, or half six, what time do you want me?"
Is quarter past six too early?
"No, I'm home till quarter past eight."
Is that alright?
Yeah.
That'll be better for me really if you don't mind.
You want a change?
How
Yeah.
was you thinking of having it cut?
Short.
What short short?
Yeah.
"Actually I think it suits you, I mean really i like  it's not on her face anyway isn't it?"
No  so short
So I think
No.
short hair would suit you cos you haven't got it all over your face have you?
Cos I saw erm  a photo when I was eighteen and I it was  sort of short in the neck  over my ears  short in there and then sort of fuller there and then just a bit of  you know a light fringe not a heavy fringe  and I thought I might have it like that so
Yeah.
That'll be nice  I can't really remember
Well I think if that was me  I'd have that done now  in case you don't like it by the time you  you get married and that could be growing again.
Oh no I wouldn't have it cut until after I got married.
Oh
No.
you'd have it cut after?
Yeah.
Oh.
Cos I definitely want my hair long for when we get married.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah  so that I can either have it  up or down really.
Yeah.
I've got the choice then.
Yeah  I do do you know I don't like to see brides with their hair down  if you've got long hair i
Oh.
but I don't think  sometimes I think  well if it looks nice  but some of them brides on there that just hangs   don't it?
"Oh yeah, I'm not having it like that."
Fog gets in.
Course it does.
All caravans are like that.
"But you've got to have those caravan, those vents because the van is so small and you've got gas supplied."
It's rules and regulations.
If you've got a gas fire in
It it means that they haven't been doing their duty in the winter then.
If they guarantee to put the mattresses all up  in the dry  they asked you to do yours  or did they say they would do it?
They done it.
Well how's the damn thing on the bed then?
Because they put it back there for these people  that was coming in.
Oh.
They didn't seemingly.
We don't know.
Do we?
No.
Well there were no  there anyway.
So they say.
It's all hearsay.
Well alright.
Perhaps the man was working part-time.
Perhaps he never noticed the .
Perhaps the people were in the van  and found the beds wet and said well we can't sleep here and they slept in the sit with the fire on.
I dunno.
It could have been.
cos there was only two here.
cold weather in any case.
Eh?
It's cold weather in any case.
That's right.
Shut the lights.
You don't know.
Yes.
"That was er  that, yeah well it's not out yet is it?"
Looks like a  looks like the front of a B M W to me.
I think that's what they're trying to emulate.
Oh that one.
How much is it?
Supposed to be.
Don't know how much it costs.
"Should think it starts at about sixteen, seventeen thousand  ."
Yeah .
A three's heavy isn't it?
Look.
Yeah.
"So you got any ideas what you're gonna get, what you should get mum for ?"
Er.
We could just  fall back on a bit of sweets and chocolate or something in the end but I'd like to get some
What  what sort of thing are you gonna get her?
there's some funny little weird shops down Thornton Heath aren't there?
What sort of thing are we talking about?
Well I dunno.
Something  I'm not  I've no idea until I see it.
Well something like soap or what?
"Could get her some, some toiletries or something."
I dunno.
I was hoping for something even more er
a Moss chemist might be able to get her some Bromley don't they?
There is a Moss chemist on the way.
Oh yes she did tell me that she'd like some of that.
Yes there is one isn't there?
By  shops.
"Right we, we'll  we'll treat that as a fail safe then."
If we can't see anything more unusual suppose we could always fall back on  the bubble baths or the  anyway I think that's a bit more than  but there you go.
I mean you can't compare it can you?
And the bedrooms!
"You can't compare it, it's the rolls royce of caravans."
"That's, that Darren said oh aye, he's the one, he's in the maroon one he said."
He's in the rolls royce.
Top of the range he said.
Beautiful thing.
Good god there's a mirror in the sitting room as big as that wall.
You'll see it when you go over there.
Beautiful thing.
"Yes,"
And I said I've bought a box of matches for him to go down and light this fire  thinking you know he might need two or three matches at a time.
But er  well I gave him a box of matches to go with him and I thought oh well  he'll have plenty of matches then.
"And I took them in, he says  what do you buy them for?"
He said.
I've got loads of matches.
In this caravan everything's electronic.
"Fridge, light switches ooh  beautiful thing it is."
Ten times the price of ours I expect.
"A caravan is a caravan after all, isn't it?"
But for what we want it for  ours is good enough.
Good enough.
That's what I'm saying perhaps  they must let it out though.
If we were having
Why's Malcolm got it?
"if we were having a caravan like that, I'd be too frightened to let it."
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't
Well there we are.
let it.
There we are.
I couldn't afford to pay for it then could I?
Yeah.
"But the point is, why should other people suffer  her."
Yeah.
"You know, they shouldn't have to should they?"
No.
All that  worrying!
Terrible!
My best friend's lost his father and he said well I lay awake all last night thinking about it.
Well I thought
Good God!
there's nothing you can laying awake .
No.
Well oh he said it's   at work and  oh God!
Well they ain't  bloody paranoid isn't he?
Well I wouldn't like to say he's paranoid but  I said well  that's like  cos he said you must our house is filthy June?
I didn't pass comment.
No.
"So I said well, that's like this Pete, you live the way you want to  and I'll live the way I want to, I said it's immaterial to me."
"Your paying me to keep it  a bit tidy, I said and that's what I'm paid for, I said I ain't  paid to pass an opinion whether it's clean or dirty  he said you sound just like me June, I said oh do I?"
"I said well I'm not bothered what other people do, I said they can"
Well if he was tidy you wouldn't have a job would you?
What?
"If he kept the place tidy, you wouldn't have a job."
"Well I nearly said that to him, but I thought ooh no!"
"But, I thought to myself well  that's up to him how he li , he, he lives his life."
Yeah.
I don't want my house looking like a tip!
But i but he is bothered about it.
Yeah.
"He said  and that's Tricia, he said she  he said when I used to live on my own  with Simon"
Yeah.
"he said, and she used to come down  he said she used to think I've got another woman!"
Two of them.
"If those men wasn't going there I would say right, put the gas fire on."
Put it on low and leave it the night and day cos it was left on for a week once wasn't it?
Mm.
"Oh god that was, that was  at er  the flat."
Left on for a fortnight.
Oh and it was a cold day.
But it was in  August or the end of September or someth er er the beginning of September  and it was a chilly day but it was still summer.
"It wasn't, you know, it wasn't terribly cold."
"But we went home and I remember going in the room, I opened the door and  oh it's lovely and warm in here!"
"So I stood by the door  I wait till dad come in cos he was the last out  and it was always my fault like, I would have left the fire on not him."
So I stood by the door and I never moved till he went in   oh he said  But with a caravan I don't know.
Mm they're not very powerful grates are they?
"Dunno   Oh nan he says, get Mark"
"Is, is yours a  heater?"
Mm?
Is yours a a long and
Well you either put one bar on  or the lot is on  or it's very dim like this is low and you can't see it at all.
There's no heat from it.
You want something that gives heat
There is heat.
But you can't see it.
Oh.
"But you want to air them beds, you want to dry them beds."
I mean you've got to have heat there.
Well Danny says get Mark and bung them in the bloody car and bring it home.
the best thing  you want to stick it in the room and put a   heater .
Well we could put it in the spare bedroom.
Put it up against the radiator.
Mm.
"But if someone's going there next week, that's  two beds, three beds."
You could put them in the sitting room.
To rebuild his rear end.
Hope he comes out of it.
"Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets ."
"No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner."
Quite a major operation.
He's been ever so bright.
"Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick his  under his tail but his little tail was wagging."
And he was walking fine.
He even stopped and had a tinkle.
See they don't know it's to hurt.
No  no.
No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain.
Because they can't tell you.
And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and
You don't know the threshold of pain in animals do you?
Can't tell you.
Well no.
Very seldom you hear a dog or a  in pain.
Oh you do.
Oh
What's the matter?
Odd.
What's odd?
I think it's getting better.
The muscle's gone
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Cup of herbal tea?
An aspirin?
Nothing I can do you for?
Oh you're  book's upstairs.
Do you want that?
".Is it actual pain then, or stiffness?"
I should have done that straight away.
Well spotted.
I will do it now.
"Say that again Paul, please."
"I'm sorry Paul, I can't understand you."
Something about an extractor?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It might be harmful to your lungs.
It hasn't been used yet.
But it's not er as good as
Well that's what it says it is on the erm  on the outside.
Orange spot on me notes .
Mm?
see what it was.
Now it's green.
That means it's been used with  copper.
We have a suspicion that  very little reaction has taken place because in fact very few bubbles have  risen to the surface.
This could be  I don't think acid spends itself as it sits in a bottle does it?
No.
It stays the same configuration.
Mm.
It's erm if you've used that lots and lots of times it may have used up all the .
It  may have exhausted mayn't it?
Yeah.
So  because it worked last time I used it.
I'm hoping that it has worked this time.
It's been in there much longer than  I'd normally leave it.
"So, it will either have not worked at all for some obscure reason  or it will have worked well and ."
"So whatever has happened, I'm now going to remove it from the acid."
I'm going to wash it.
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
said Nat innocently .
"`` Well , I do n't know about that , '' began Mrs. Bhaer , rather startled by the coolness of the proposition ."
"`` Why , I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you , and be kind to 'em as you were to me , '' said Nat , looking surprised and alarmed ."
"`` So I do , but I like to know something about them first ."
"I have to choose them , because there are so many ."
I have not room for all .
I wish I had . ''
"`` I told him to come because I thought you 'd like it , but if there is n't room he can go away again , '' said Nat , sorrowfully ."
"The boy 's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer , and she could not find the heart to disappoint his hope , and spoil his kind little plan , so she said , `` Tell me about this Dan . ''"
"`` I do n't know any thing , only he has n't got any folks , and he 's poor , and he was good to me , so I 'd like to be good to him if I could . ''"
"`` Excellent reasons every one ; but really , Nat , the house is full , and I do n't know where I could put him , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , more and more inclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her ."
"`` He could have my bed , and I could sleep in the barn ."
"It is n't cold now , and I do n't mind , I used to sleep anywhere with father , '' said Nat , eagerly ."
"Something in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his shoulder , and say in her kindest tone : `` Bring in your friend , Nat ; I think we must find room for him without giving him your place . ''"
"Nat joyfully ran off , and soon returned followed by a most unprepossessing boy , who slouched in and stood looking about him , with a half bold , half sullen look , which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself , after one glance , `` A bad specimen , I am afraid . ''"
"`` This is Dan , '' said Nat , presenting him as if sure of his welcome ."
"`` Nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us , '' began Mrs. Jo , in a friendly tone ."
"`` Yes , '' was the gruff reply ."
`` Have you no friends to take care of you ? ''
`` No . ''
"`` Say , ` No , ma'am , ' '' whispered Nat ."
"`` Sha n't neither , '' muttered Dan ."
`` How old are you ? ''
`` About fourteen . ''
`` You look older .
What can you do ? '' ''
` Most anything . ''
"`` If you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do , work and study as well as play ."
Are you willing to agree to that ? ''
`` Do n't mind trying . ''
"`` Well , you can stay a few days , and we will see how we get on together ."
"Take him out , Nat , and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home , when we will settle about the matter , '' said Mrs. Jo , finding it rather difficult to get on with this cool young person , who fixed his big black eyes on her with a hard , suspicious expression , sorrowfully unboyish ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
"cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the announcement , `` I 'm going to stay . ''"
`` Hooray ! ''
"bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched , for Nan was a kindred spirit , and he foresaw `` larks '' in the future ."
"`` I can bat ; let me play , '' said Nan , who could turn her hand to any thing , and did not mind hard knocks ."
"`` We ai n't playing now , and our side beat without you . ''"
"`` I can beat you in running , any way , '' returned Nan , falling back on her strong point ."
`` Can she ? ''
asked Nat of Jack .
"`` She runs very well for a girl , '' answered Jack , who looked down upon Nan with condescending approval ."
`` Will you try ? ''
"said Nan , longing to display her powers ."
"`` It 's too hot , '' and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite exhausted ."
`` What 's the matter with Stuffy ? ''
"asked Nan , whose quick eyes were roving from face to face ."
"`` Ball hurt his hand ; he howls at every thing , '' answered Jack scornfully ."
"`` I do n't , I never cry , no matter how I 'm hurt ; it 's babyish , '' said Nan , loftily ."
`` Pooh !
"I could make you cry in two minutes , '' returned Stuffy , rousing up ."
`` See if you can . ''
"`` Go and pick that bunch of nettles , then , '' and Stuffy pointed to a sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall ."
"Nan instantly `` grasped the nettle , '' pulled it up , and held it with a defiant gesture , in spite of the almost unbearable sting ."
"`` Good for you , '' cried the boys , quick to acknowledge courage even in one of the weaker sex ."
"More nettled than she was , Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her somehow , and he said tauntingly , `` You are used to poking your hands into every thing , so that is n't fair ."
"Now go and bump your head real hard against the barn , and see if you do n't howl then . ''"
"`` Do n't do it , '' said Nat , who hated cruelty ."
"But Nan was off , and running straight at the barn , she gave her head a blow that knocked her flat , and sounded like a battering-ram ."
"Dizzy , but undaunted , she staggered up , saying stoutly , though her face was drawn with pain , `` That hurt , but I do n't cry . ''"
"`` Do it again , '' said Stuffy angrily ; and Nan would have done it , but Nat held her ; and Tommy , forgetting the heat , flew at Stuffy like a little game-cock , roaring out , `` Stop it , or I 'll throw you over the barn ! ''"
and so shook and hustled poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head or his heels .
"`` She told me to , '' was all he could say , when Tommy let him alone ."
"`` Never mind if she did ; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl , '' said Demi , reproachfully ."
`` Ho !
"`` Well , all our men folk have gone now -- Jem and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl ."
And none of them had to be driven to it .
So we have a right to be proud .
But pride -- '' Susan sighed bitterly -- `` pride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying . ''
"The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west , the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadow -- and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki -- the living and the dead -- were in possession of Vimy Ridge ."
Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War .
"`` The British could n't take it and the French could n't take it , '' said a German prisoner to his captors , `` but you Canadians are such fools that you do n't know when a place ca n't be taken ! ''"
So the `` fools '' took it -- and paid the price .
"Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge -- shot in the back , the telegram said ."
"`` Poor Nan , '' said Mrs. Blythe , when the news came ."
She thought of her own happy girlhood at old Green Gables .
There had been no tragedy like this in it .
How the girls of to-day had to suffer !
When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her .
"John Meredith , too , seemed to have grown old suddenly in them ."
"Faith did not come home ; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also , but had been told that for her mother 's sake it could not be given ."
"So Di , after a flying visit home , went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport ."
The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley .
Rilla was watching for them .
"Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers ; Walter brought them to her when Jem was gone ; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her ; now , Rilla thought she must take the boys ' place in this ."
"But before she had discovered any , Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays ."
He stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on Mrs. Blythe 's lap .
"`` Because Shirley is n't here to bring them , '' he said in his funny , shy , blunt way ."
"`` And you thought of this , you darling , '' said Anne , her lips quivering , as she looked at the stocky , black-browed little chap , standing before her , with his hands thrust into his pockets ."
"`` I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry ` bout you not getting your mayflowers , '' said Bruce seriously , '' 'cause I 'd see to that ."
"And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now , so it wo n't be very long before I 'll be eighteen , and then I 'll go to help him fight , and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place ."
"I wrote Jerry , too ."
"Jerry 's getting better , you know . ''"
`` Is he ?
Have you had any good news about him ? ''
`` Yes .
"Mother had a letter to-day , and it said he was out of danger . ''"
And there was a wind that came dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music more beautiful still .
The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got back to breakfast .
"They were all yawny , and some were grumpy , but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as blithesome as the day ."
"Oh , life is so good to live !"
"Tomorrow Uncle James 's new vessel , the White Lady , is to be launched ."
"We are going to make a festive occasion of it , and I am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine ."
"But I hear the carriage , and Aunt Jane is calling me ."
"I had a great deal more to say -- about your letter , your big `` round-up '' and your tribulations with your Chinese cook -- but I 've only time now to say goodbye ."
"You wish me a lovely time at the dance and a full programme , do n't you ?"
"Yours sincerely , Sidney Richmond ."
Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby .
"Sidney said her prayers , went to bed , and slept soundly and serenely ."
"She mailed her letter the next day , and a month later an answer came ."
"Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office , and walked the rest of the way home as in a nightmare , staring straight ahead of her with wide-open , unseeing brown eyes ."
"John Lincoln 's letter was short , but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney 's brain ."
He wrote : I am going east for a visit .
"It is six years since I was home , and it seems like three times six ."
"I shall go by the C.P.R. , which passes through Plainfield , and I mean to stop off for a day ."
"You will let me call and see you , wo n't you ?"
"I shall have to take your permission for granted , as I shall be gone before a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in five days , and shall look forward to our meeting with all possible interest and pleasure ."
"Sidney did not sleep that night , but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow ."
"She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that Aunt Jane noticed it , and asked her what the matter was ."
"`` Nothing , '' said Sidney sharply ."
Sidney had never spoken sharply to her aunt before .
The good woman shook her head .
She was afraid the child was `` taking something . ''
"`` Do n't do much today , Siddy , '' she said kindly ."
`` Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up .
I 'll fix you a dose of quinine . ''
Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy .
"She swallowed the quinine meekly enough , but she worked fiercely all day , hunting out superfluous tasks to do ."
"That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion , but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible ."
"`` Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you ."
"An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . ''"
"`` Well , '' cried the lad , flushing , `` ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other ."
Laugh while yet ye may ! ''
"`` Nay , now , good cousin , '' replied Sir Daniel , with some earnestness , `` think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends ."
"I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to !"
and cherish you exceedingly .
"I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ."
"Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton -- Lady Shelton , by my troth !"
for the lad promiseth bravely .
Tut !
ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy .
"They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin ."
"Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John ."
"Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Master John , `` I will break no bread ."
"Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul 's interest ."
"But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . ''"
"`` Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! ''"
cried the knight .
"`` Shalt be well shriven , by my faith !"
"Content you , then , and eat . ''"
"But the lad was obstinate , drank a cup of water , and , once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle , sat in a far corner , brooding ."
"In an hour or two , there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses ; and then a troop drew up by the inn door , and Richard Shelton , splashed with mud , presented himself upon the threshold ."
"`` Save you , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` How !
Dickie Shelton ! ''
cried the knight ; and at the mention of Dick 's name the other lad looked curiously across .
`` What maketh Bennet Hatch ? ''
"`` Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , '' answered Richard , presenting the priest 's letter ."
"`` And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . ''"
`` How say you ?
It seemed a pity to waste him .
"And say , was n't it fun to hear that girl yell ? ''"
Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables .
"Anne hurried home from school , for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give ."
"Dora , neat and proper , in her nicely starched white dress and black sash , was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor , speaking demurely when spoken to , keeping silence when not , and in every way comporting herself as a model child ."
"Davy , blissfully dirty , was making mud pies in the barnyard ."
"`` I told him he might , '' said Marilla wearily ."
`` I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief .
He can only get dirty at that .
We 'll have our teas over before we call him to his .
"Dora can have hers with us , but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here . ''"
When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor .
Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out .
A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on .
Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure .
"Marilla and Anne stared in dismay , the Aids in amazement ."
"Could that be Dora ... that sobbing nondescript in a drenched , dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marilla 's new coin-spot rug ?"
"`` Dora , what has happened to you ? ''"
"cried Anne , with a guilty glance at Mrs. Jasper Bell , whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred ."
"`` Davy made me walk the pigpen fence , '' wailed Dora ."
`` I did n't want to but he called me a fraid-cat .
And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me .
"My dress was just awful but Davy said if I 'd stand under the pump he 'd wash it clean , and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ai n't a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled . ''"
Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes .
Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper .
"Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously ... a method in which she had great faith , not altogether unjustified by results ."
She told him she felt very badly over his conduct .
"`` I feel sorry now myself , '' admitted Davy , `` but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after I 've did them ."
"Dora would n't help me make pies , cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made me hopping mad ."
I s ` pose Paul Irving would n't have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she 'd fall in ? ''
"`` No , he would never dream of such a thing ."
Paul is a perfect little gentleman . ''
No one but herself -- and perhaps Rilla -- knew it -- would ever know it .
She had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve .
She must hide and bear her long pain as best she could -- alone .
"But she , too , would keep faith ."
CHAPTER XXIV MARY IS JUST IN TIME The autumn of 1916 was a bitter season for Ingleside .
"Mrs. Blythe 's return to health was slow , and sorrow and loneliness were in all hearts ."
Every one tried to hide it from the others and `` carry on '' cheerfully .
Rilla laughed a good deal .
"Nobody at Ingleside was deceived by her laughter ; it came from her lips only , never from her heart ."
"But outsiders said some people got over trouble very easily , and Irene Howard remarked that she was surprised to find how shallow Rilla Blythe really was ."
"`` Why , after all her pose of being so devoted to Walter , she does n't seem to mind his death at all ."
Nobody has ever seen her shed a tear or heard her mention his name .
She has evidently quite forgotten him .
Poor fellow -- you 'd really think his family would feel it more .
"I spoke of him to Rilla at the last Junior Red meeting -- of how fine and brave and splendid he was -- and I said life could never be just the same to me again , now that Walter had gone -- we were such friends , you know -- why I was the very first person he told about having enlisted -- and Rilla answered , as coolly and indifferently as if she were speaking of an entire stranger , ` He was just one of many fine and splendid boys who have given everything for their country . '"
"Well , I wish I could take things as calmly -- but I 'm not made like that ."
I 'm so sensitive -- things hurt me terribly -- I really never get over them .
I asked Rilla right out why she did n't put on mourning for Walter .
She said her mother did n't wish it .
But every one is talking about it . ''
"`` Rilla does n't wear colours -- nothing but white , '' protested Betty Mead ."
"`` White becomes her better than anything else , '' said Irene significantly ."
`` And we all know black does n't suit her complexion at all .
But of course I 'm not saying that is the reason she does n't wear it .
"Only , it 's funny ."
If my brother had died I 'd have gone into deep mourning .
I would n't have had the heart for anything else .
I confess I 'm disappointed in Rilla Blythe . ''
"`` I am not , then , '' cried Betty Meade , loyally , `` I think Rilla is just a wonderful girl ."
A few years ago I admit I did think she was rather too vain and gigglesome ; but now she is nothing of the sort .
"I do n't think there is a girl in the Glen who is so unselfish and plucky as Rilla , or who has done her bit as thoroughly and patiently ."
"Our Junior Red Cross would have gone on the rocks a dozen times if it had n't been for her tact and perseverance and enthusiasm -- you know that perfectly well , Irene . ''"
Before Miss Marshall had finished reading that letter she had cried three times and laughed times past counting .
"More tears came at the end -- happy , tender tears such as Miss Marshall had not shed for years ."
Something warm and sweet and gentle seemed to thrill to life within her heart .
"So those girls were not such selfish , heedless young creatures as she had supposed !"
How kind it had been in Cyrilla Blair to think of her and write so to her .
She no longer felt lonely and neglected .
Her whole sombre world had been brightened to sunshine by that merry friendly letter .
Mrs. Plunkett 's table was surrounded by a ring of smiling faces that night .
Everybody seemed in good spirits in spite of the weather .
"The pale little dressmaker , who had hardly uttered a word since her arrival a week before , talked and laughed quite merrily and girlishly , thanking Cyrilla unreservedly for her `` jolly letter . ''"
"Old Mr. Grant did not grumble once about the rain or the food or his rheumatism and he told Carol that she might be a good letter writer in time if she looked after her grammar more carefully -- which , from Mr. Grant , was high praise ."
All the others declared that they were delighted with their letters -- all except Miss Marshall .
"She said nothing but later on , when Cyrilla was going upstairs , she met Miss Marshall in the shadows of the second landing ."
"`` My dear , '' said Miss Marshall gently , `` I want to thank you for your letter , I do n't think you can realize just what it has meant to me ."
I was so -- so lonely and tired and discouraged .
It heartened me right up .
I -- I know you have thought me a cross and disagreeable person .
"I 'm afraid I have been , too ."
But -- but -- I shall try to be less so in future .
"If I ca n't succeed all at once do n't mind me because , under it all , I shall always be your friend ."
And I mean to keep your letter and read it over every time I feel myself getting bitter and hard again . ''
"`` Dear Miss Marshall , I 'm so glad you liked it , '' said Cyrilla frankly ."
`` We 're all your friends and would be glad to be chummy with you .
Only we thought perhaps we bothered you with our nonsense . ''
"`` Come and see me sometimes , '' said Miss Marshall with a smile ."
`` I 'll try to be ` chummy ' -- perhaps I 'm not yet too old to learn the secret of friendliness .
Your letter has made me think that I have missed much in shutting all young life out from mine as I have done .
I want to reform in this respect if I can . ''
When Cyrilla reached the front room she found Mrs. Plunkett there .
"`` I 've just dropped in , Miss Blair , '' said that worthy woman , `` to say that I dunno as I mind your making candy once in a while if you want to ."
Only do be careful not to set the place on fire .
Please be particularly careful not to set it on fire . ''
`` I 'm going straight to Lorenzo White 's . ''
"`` But he lives on the White Sands road and it 's quite a distance out of our way , '' protested Diana ."
`` Gilbert and Fred will canvass him . ''
"`` They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then , '' said Anne firmly ."
`` The novelty will be worn off .
Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now .
"We must n't let such a golden opportunity slip , Diana . ''"
The result justified Anne 's foresight .
"Mr. White met them in the yard , beaming like the sun upon an Easter day ."
When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically .
"`` Certain , certain ."
Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription you 've got . ''
"`` That will be five dollars ... Mr. Daniel Blair put down four , '' said Anne , half afraid ."
But Lorenzo did not flinch .
`` Five it is ... and here 's the money on the spot .
"Now , I want you to come into the house ."
There 's something in there worth seeing ... something very few people have seen as yet .
Just come in and pass YOUR opinion . ''
`` What will we say if the baby is n't pretty ? ''
whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house .
"`` Oh , there will certainly be something else nice to say about it , '' said Anne easily ."
`` There always is about a baby . ''
"The baby WAS pretty , however , and Mr. White felt that he got his five dollars ' worth of the girls ' honest delight over the plump little newcomer ."
"But that was the first , last , and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything ."
"Anne , tired as she was , made one more effort for the public weal that night , slipping over the fields to interview Mr. Harrison , who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him ."
"Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road ; but Jane and Gertie , who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report , had nervously begged Anne to canvass him ."
"Mr. Harrison , however , flatly refused to subscribe a cent , and all Anne 's wiles were in vain ."
"`` But I thought you approved of our society , Mr. Harrison , '' she mourned ."
"`` So I do ... so I do ... but my approval does n't go as deep as my pocket , Anne . ''"
"`` A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews , '' Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime ."
VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed .
"She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises , but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work ."
He was so bright and nice-mannered everybody liked him .
"Him and Anne were a fine-looking couple , Nora May ."
Not but what they had their shortcomings .
Anne 's nose was a mite too long and Gil had a crooked mouth .
"Besides , they was both pretty proud and sperrited and high-strung ."
But they thought an awful lot of each other .
It made me feel young again to see 'em .
"Anne was n't a mossel vain , but nights she expected Gil she 'd prink for hours afore her glass , fixing her hair this way and that , and trying on all her good clothes to see which become her most ."
I used to love her for it .
And I used to love to see the way Gil 's face would light up when she came into a room or place where he was .
"Amanda Perkins , she says to me once , `` Anne Douglas and Gil Martin are most terrible struck on each other . ''"
And she said it in a tone that indicated that it was a dreadful disgraceful and unbecoming state of affairs .
Amanda had a disappointment once and it soured her .
"I immediately responded , `` Yes , they are most terrible struck on each other , '' and I said it in a tone that indicated I thought it a most beautiful and lovely thing that they should be so ."
And so it was .
"You 're rather too young to be thinking of such things , Nora May , but you 'll remember my words when the time comes ."
"Another nephew of mine , James Ebenezer Lawson -- he calls himself James E. back there in town , and I do n't blame him , for I never could stand Ebenezer for a name myself ; but that 's neither here nor there ."
"Well , he said their love was idyllic , I ai n't very sure what that means ."
I looked it up in the dictionary after James Ebenezer left -- I would n't display my ignorance afore him -- but I ca n't say that I was much the wiser for it .
"Anyway , it meant something real nice ; I was sure of that by the way James Ebenezer spoke and the wistful look in his eyes ."
"James Ebenezer is n't married ; he was to have been , and she died a month afore the wedding day ."
He was never the same man again .
"Well , to get back to Gilbert and Anne ."
When Anne 's school year ended in June she resigned and went home to get ready to be married .
"The wedding was to be in September , and I promised Anne faithful I 'd go over to Montrose in August for two weeks and help her to get her quilts ready ."
Anne thought that nobody could quilt like me .
"I was as tickled as a girl at the thought of visiting with Anne for two weeks , but I never went ; things happened before August ."
I do n't know rightly how the trouble began .
Other folks -- jealous folks -- made mischief .
Anne was thirty miles away and Gilbert could n't see her every day to keep matters clear and fair .
"Besides , as I 've said , they were both proud and high-sperrited ."
The upshot of it was they had a terrible quarrel and the engagement was broken .
"When he reached the scene of the accident he dreaded to look over the broken edge , but she was lying there safely and she smiled when she saw him -- a brave smile that softened her tense white face into the likeness of a frightened child 's ."
"`` If I drop the rope down to you , are you strong enough to hold to it while the earth goes and then draw yourself up the slope hand over hand ? ''"
asked Alan anxiously .
"`` Yes , '' she answered fearlessly ."
"Alan passed down one end of the rope and then braced himself firmly to hold it , for there was no tree near enough to be of any assistance ."
"The next moment the full weight of her body swung from it , for at her first movement the soil beneath her slipped away ."
Alan 's heart sickened ; what if she went with it ?
Could she cling to the rope while he drew her up ?
Then he saw she was still safe on the sloping shelf .
"Carefully and painfully she drew herself to her knees and , dinging to the rope , crept up the rock hand over hand ."
When she came within his reach he grasped her arms and lifted her up into safety beside him .
"`` Thank God , '' he said , with whiter lips than her own ."
"For a few moments Lynde sat silent on the sod , exhausted with fright and exertion , while her dog fawned on her in an ecstasy of joy ."
Finally she looked up into Alan 's anxious face and their eyes met .
It was something more than the physical reaction that suddenly flushed the girl 's cheeks .
She sprang lithely to her feet .
`` Can you walk back home ? ''
Alan asked .
"`` Oh , yes , I am all right now ."
It was very foolish of me to get into such a predicament .
Father and Emily went down the lake in the yacht this afternoon and I started out for a ramble .
When I came here I saw some junebells growing right out on the ledge and I crept out to gather them .
I should have known better .
"It broke away under me and the more I tried to scramble back the faster it slid down , carrying me with it ."
I thought it would go right over the brink '' -- she gave a little involuntary shudder -- `` but just at the very edge it stopped .
I knew I must lie very still or it would go right over .
It seemed like days .
"Pat was with me and I told him to go for help , but I knew there was no one at home -- and I was horribly afraid , '' she concluded with another shiver ."
`` I never was afraid in my life before -- at least not with that kind of fear . ''
"`` You have had a terrible experience and a narrow escape , '' said Alan lamely ."
He could think of nothing more to say ; his usual readiness of utterance seemed to have failed him .
"`` You saved my life , '' she said , `` you and Pat -- for doggie must have his share of credit . ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"John , what are -- '' But Hook had found his voice again ."
`` Tie her up ! ''
he shouted .
It was Smee who tied her to the mast .
"`` See here , honey , '' he whispered , `` I 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ''"
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise .
"`` I would almost rather have no children at all , '' she said disdainfully -LSB- scornfully -RSB- ."
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they were about to take .
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they could stare and shiver only ."
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward Wendy ."
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one .
"But he never reached her , he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her ."
He heard something else instead .
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile .
"They all heard it -- pirates , boys , Wendy ; and immediately every head was blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but toward Hook ."
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators ."
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him .
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint .
He fell in a little heap .
"The sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought , `` The crocodile is about to board the ship ! ''"
Even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted .
"Left so fearfully alone , any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working , and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go ."
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke ."
`` Hide me ! ''
he cried hoarsely .
"They gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard ."
They had no thought of fighting it .
It was Fate .
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile climbing it .
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid .
It was Peter .
Her sunbonnet had fallen back and some loose tendrils of her auburn hair were curling around her forehead .
Her cheeks were so pink and her eyes so bright from running that she looked almost girlish .
"`` Oh , Mr. Harrington , '' she said breathlessly , `` that pet pig of Bobbles ' is in your garden again ."
He only got in this minute .
I saw him coming and I ran right after him . ''
"`` He 's there , all right , '' said Harrington cheerfully , `` but I 'll get him out in a jiffy ."
Do n't tire yourself .
Wo n't you go into the house and rest while I drive him around ? ''
"Mrs. Hayden , however , was determined to help and they both went around to the garden , set the gate open , and tried to drive the pig out ."
"But Harrington was not thinking about pigs , and Mrs. Hayden did not know quite so much about driving them as Mordecai did ; as a consequence they did not make much headway ."
"In her excitement Mrs. Hayden ran over beds and whatever came in her way , and Harrington , in order to keep near her , ran after her ."
Between them they spoiled things about as much as a whole drove of pigs would have done .
"But at last the pig grew tired of the fun , bolted out of the gate , and ran across the yard to his own place ."
Mrs. Hayden followed slowly and Harrington walked beside her .
"`` Those pigs are all to be shut up tomorrow , '' she said ."
`` Hiram has been fixing up a place for them in his spare moments and it is ready at last . ''
"`` Oh , I would n't , '' said Harrington hastily ."
`` It is n't good for pigs to be shut up so young .
You 'd better let them run a while yet . ''
"`` No , '' said Mrs. Hayden decidedly ."
`` They have almost worried me to death already .
In they go tomorrow . ''
"They were at the lane gate now , and Harrington had to open it and let her pass through ."
"He felt quite desperate as he watched her trip up through the rows of apple trees , her blue gingham skirt brushing the lush grasses where a lacy tangle of sunbeams and shadows lay ."
"Bobbles and Ted came running to meet her and the three , hand in hand , disappeared from sight ."
"Harrington went back to the house , feeling that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
"That evening at the tea table he caught himself wondering what it would be like to see Mary Hayden sitting at his table in place of Sarah King , with Bobbles and Ted on either hand ."
Then he found out what was the matter with him .
"He was in love , fathoms deep , with the blue-eyed widow !"
"Presumably the pigs were shut up the next day , for Harrington 's garden was invaded no more ."
He stood it for a week and then surrendered at discretion .
"He filled a basket with early strawberries and went across to the Hayden place , boldly enough to all appearance , but with his heart thumping like any schoolboy 's ."
"If you can not attend to your business , I shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who can ."
The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is really getting beyond endurance . ''
A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella 's tongue .
All her bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and eyes .
"For one moment she was determined to speak out , to repay Mrs. Liddell 's insolence in kind ."
A retort was ready to her hand .
"Everyone knew that Mrs. Liddell , before her marriage to a wealthy man , had been a working girl ."
"What could be easier than to say contemptuously : `` You should be a judge of a clerk 's courtesy and ability , madam ."
You were a shop girl yourself once ? ''
"But if she said it , what would follow ?"
Prompt and instant dismissal .
And Patty ?
The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in Marcella 's soul .
For Patty 's sake she must control her temper -- and she did .
"With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly : `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Liddell ."
I did not mean to be inattentive .
"Let me show you some of our new lingerie waists , I think you will like them . ''"
But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella brought to her in her trembling hands .
For another half hour she examined and found fault and sneered .
"Then she swept away with the scornful remark that she did n't see a thing there that was fit to wear , and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything worth looking at ."
"When she had gone , Marcella leaned against the counter , pale and exhausted ."
She must have a breathing spell .
"Oh , how her head ached !"
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was !
She longed for the country herself .
"Oh , if she and Patty could only go away to some place where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills where the air was sweet and pure !"
During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool beside the bargain counter .
"When a clerk asked her if she wished to be waited on , she said , `` No , I 'm just waiting here for a friend who promised to meet me . ''"
She was tall and gaunt and grey haired .
"She had square jaws and cold grey eyes and an aggressive nose , but there was something attractive in her plain face , a mingling of common sense and kindliness ."
She watched Marcella and Mrs. Liddell closely and lost nothing of all that was said and done on both sides .
Now and then she smiled grimly and nodded .
I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates .
"When we got to the inn , the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together , finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it , before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection ."
"Long John told the story from first to last , with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth ."
"`` That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? ''"
"he would say , now and again , and I could always bear him entirely out ."
"The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away , but we all agreed there was nothing to be done , and after he had been complimented , Long John took up his crutch and departed ."
"`` All hands aboard by four this afternoon , '' shouted the squire after him ."
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' cried the cook , in the passage ."
"`` Well , squire , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . ''"
"`` The man 's a perfect trump , '' declared the squire ."
"`` And now , '' added the doctor , `` Jim may come on board with us , may he not ? ''"
"`` To be sure he may , '' says squire ."
"`` Take your hat , Hawkins , and we 'll see the ship . ''"
"9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out , and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships , and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel , and sometimes swung above us ."
"At last , however , we got alongside , and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate , Mr. Arrow , a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint ."
"He and the squire were very thick and friendly , but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain ."
"This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why , for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us ."
"`` Captain Smollett , sir , axing to speak with you , '' said he ."
`` I am always at the captain 's orders .
"Show him in , '' said the squire ."
"The captain , who was close behind his messenger , entered at once and shut the door behind him ."
"`` Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ?"
"All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said the captain , `` better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence ."
I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer .
That 's short and sweet . ''
"`` Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? ''"
"inquired the squire , very angry , as I could see ."
"`` I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , '' said the captain ."
`` She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . ''
"`` Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? ''"
says the squire .
"It looked strange enough , to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side , wattled about growing trees ."
"And even then , I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding , who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds ."
"The luck , it seems , changed on the second day ."
"About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner , and as usual refused to eat , and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed ."
"The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage , and this dazzled and offended me ."
"Cluny sat at the table , biting the pack of cards ."
"Alan had stooped over the bed , and had his face close to my eyes ; to which , troubled as they were with the fever , it seemed of the most shocking bigness ."
He asked me for a loan of my money .
`` What for ? ''
"said I. `` O , just for a loan , '' said he ."
`` But why ? ''
I repeated .
`` I do n't see . ''
"`` Hut , David ! ''"
"said Alan , `` ye wouldnae grudge me a loan ? ''"
"I would , though , if I had had my senses !"
"But all I thought of then was to get his face away , and I handed him my money ."
"On the morning of the third day , when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage , I awoke with a great relief of spirits , very weak and weary indeed , but seeing things of the right size and with their honest , everyday appearance ."
"I had a mind to eat , moreover , rose from bed of my own movement , and as soon as we had breakfasted , stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood ."
"It was a grey day with a cool , mild air : and I sat in a dream all morning , only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny 's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports ; for as the coast was at that time clear , you might almost say he held court openly ."
"When I returned , he and Alan had laid the cards aside , and were questioning a gillie ; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic ."
"`` I have no Gaelic , sir , '' said I ."
"Now since the card question , everything I said or did had the power of annoying Cluny ."
"`` Your name has more sense than yourself , then , '' said he angrily , `` for it 's good Gaelic ."
But the point is this .
"My scout reports all clear in the south , and the question is , have ye the strength to go ? ''"
"I saw cards on the table , but no gold ; only a heap of little written papers , and these all on Cluny 's side ."
"Alan , besides , had an odd look , like a man not very well content ; and I began to have a strong misgiving ."
"`` I do not know if I am as well as I should be , '' said I , looking at Alan ; `` but the little money we have has a long way to carry us . ''"
"Alan took his under-lip into his mouth , and looked upon the ground ."
"`` David , '' says he at last , `` I 've lost it ; there 's the naked truth . ''"
`` My money too ? ''
` It 's true I have n't lost a husband -- I have only lost the man who would have been my husband .
I have lost no son -- only the sons and daughters who might have been born to me -- who will never be born to me now . ' ''
"` It is n't ladylike to talk like that , ' said Cousin Sophia in a shocked tone ; and then Gertrude laughed right out , so wildly that Cousin Sophia was really frightened ."
"And when poor tortured Gertrude , unable to endure it any longer , hurried out of the room , Cousin Sophia asked mother if the blow had n't affected Miss Oliver 's mind . '' '"
"I suffered the loss of two good kind partners , ' she said , ` but it did not affect me like that . '"
`` I should think it would n't !
Those poor men must have been thankful to die .
`` I heard Gertrude walking up and down her room most of the night .
She walked like that every night .
But never so long as that night .
And once I heard her give a dreadful sudden little cry as if she had been stabbed .
I could n't sleep for suffering with her ; and I could n't help her .
I thought the night would never end .
But it did ; and then ` joy came in the morning ' as the Bible says .
Only it did n't come exactly in the morning but well along in the afternoon .
The telephone rang and I answered it .
"It was old Mrs. Grant speaking from Charlottetown , and her news was that it was all a mistake -- Robert was n't killed at all ; he had only been slightly wounded in the arm and was safe in the hospital out of harm 's way for a time anyhow ."
They had n't learned yet how the mistake had happened but supposed there must have been another Robert Grant .
`` I hung up the telephone and flew to Rainbow Valley .
I 'm sure I did fly -- I ca n't remember my feet ever touching the ground .
"I met Gertrude on her way home from school in the glade of spruces where we used to play , and I just gasped out the news to her ."
"I ought to have had more sense , of course ."
But I was so crazy with joy and excitement that I never stopped to think .
Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns as if she had been shot .
The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible -- in this respect at least -- for the rest of my life .
I thought I had killed her -- I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman .
It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating .
A pretty time I had !
"I never saw anybody faint before , and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help , because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond ."
"But I knew -- theoretically -- how people in a faint should be treated , and now I know it practically ."
"Luckily the brook was handy , and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life ."
She never said one word about my news and I did n't dare to refer to it again .
I hung on to my blue straw sailor as long as I could .
How I hate the green velvet hat !
It is so elaborate and conspicuous .
I do n't see how I could ever have liked it .
But I vowed to wear it and wear it I will .
`` Shirley and I went down to the station this morning to take Little Dog Monday a bang-up Christmas dinner .
"Dog Monday waits and watches there still , with just as much hope and confidence as ever ."
Sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly .
We never try to coax him home now : we know it is of no use .
"When Jem comes back , Monday will come home with him ; and if Jem -- never comes back -- Monday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes on beating ."
`` Fred Arnold was here last night .
He was eighteen in November and is going to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have .
"He has been coming here very often lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable , because I am afraid he is thinking that perhaps I could care something for him ."
"I ca n't tell him about Ken -- because , after all , what is there to tell ?"
And yet I do n't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon .
It is very perplexing .
I remember I used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beaux -- and now I 'm worried to death because two are too many .
`` I am learning to cook .
Susan is teaching me .
"I tried to learn long ago -- but no , let me be honest -- Susan tried to teach me , which is a very different thing ."
I never seemed to succeed with anything and I got discouraged .
But since the boys have gone away I wanted to be able to make cake and things for them myself and so I started in again and this time I 'm getting on surprisingly well .
"Susan says it is all in the way I hold my mouth and father says my subconscious mind is desirous of learning now , and I dare say they 're both right ."
"Anyhow , I can make dandy short-bread and fruitcake ."
"I got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs , but made an awful failure of them ."
They came out of the oven flat as flukes .
I thought maybe the cream would fill them up again and make them plump but it did n't .
I think Susan was secretly pleased .
She is past mistress in the art of making cream puffs and it would break her heart if anyone else here could make them as well .
"I wonder if Susan tampered -- but no , I wo n't suspect her of such a thing ."
"`` Miranda Pryor spent an afternoon here a few days ago , helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of ` vermin shirts . '"
"Susan thinks that name is not quite decent , so I suggested she call them ` cootie sarks , ' which is old Highland Sandy 's version of it ."
he said .
`` Dinner ? ''
"`` Ay , sot , '' replied the cook , `` dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread ."
"But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart 's desire both of ale and wine ."
"But now are men 's spirits dead ; and this John Amend-All , save us and guard us !"
but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . ''
"`` Nay , '' returned the other , `` y ' are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless ."
Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . ''
"`` Look ye , '' returned the cook , `` I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high ."
"I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king 's archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth !"
and shot the king 's deer .
What cometh of it ?
Naught !
I were better to have bided in the cloister .
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All .
By ' r Lady !
here they come . ''
"One after another , tall , likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn ."
"Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup , helped himself from the caldron , and sat down upon the grass to eat ."
"They were very variously equipped and armed ; some in rusty smocks , and with nothing but a knife and an old bow ; others in the height of forest gallantry , all in Lincoln green , both hood and jerkin , with dainty peacock arrows in their belts , a horn upon a baldrick , and a sword and dagger at their sides ."
"They came in the silence of hunger , and scarce growled a salutation , but fell instantly to meat ."
"There were , perhaps , a score of them already gathered , when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns , and immediately after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debauched upon the lawn ."
"A tall , lusty fellow , somewhat grizzled , and as brown as a smoked ham , walked before them with an air of some authority , his bow at his back , a bright boar-spear in his hand ."
`` Lads ! ''
"he cried , `` good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y ' have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease ."
But what said I ever ?
"Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift ."
And lo !
"here is her little firstling -- even that good creature , ale ! ''"
There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask .
"`` And now haste ye , boys , '' the man continued ."
`` There is work toward .
Kettley was one such place ; it had come very lately into his clutches ; he still met with opposition from the tenants ; and it was to overawe discontent that he had led his troops that way .
"By two in the morning , Sir Daniel sat in the inn room , close by the fireside , for it was cold at that hour among the fens of Kettley ."
By his elbow stood a pottle of spiced ale .
"He had taken off his visored headpiece , and sat with his bald head and thin , dark visage resting on one hand , wrapped warmly in a sanguine-coloured cloak ."
"At the lower end of the room about a dozen of his men stood sentry over the door or lay asleep on benches ; and somewhat nearer hand , a young lad , apparently of twelve or thirteen , was stretched in a mantle on the floor ."
The host of the Sun stood before the great man .
"`` Now , mark me , mine host , '' Sir Daniel said , `` follow but mine orders , and I shall be your good lord ever ."
"I must have good men for head boroughs , and I will have Adam-a-More high constable ; see to it narrowly ."
"If other men be chosen , it shall avail you nothing ; rather it shall be found to your sore cost ."
"For those that have paid rent to Walsingham I shall take good measure -- you among the rest , mine host . ''"
"`` Good knight , '' said the host , `` I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I did but pay to Walsingham upon compulsion ."
"Nay , bully knight , I love not the rogue Walsinghams ; they were as poor as thieves , bully knight ."
Give me a great lord like you .
"Nay ; ask me among the neighbours , I am stout for Brackley . ''"
"`` It may be , '' said Sir Daniel , dryly ."
`` Ye shall then pay twice . ''
"The innkeeper made a horrid grimace ; but this was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times , and he was perhaps glad to make his peace so easily ."
"`` Bring up yon fellow , Selden ! ''"
cried the knight .
"And one of his retainers led up a poor , cringing old man , as pale as a candle , and all shaking with the fen fever ."
"`` Sirrah , '' said Sir Daniel , `` your name ? ''"
"`` A n't please your worship , '' replied the man , `` my name is Condall -- Condall of Shoreby , at your good worship 's pleasure . ''"
"`` I have heard you ill reported on , '' returned the knight ."
"`` Ye deal in treason , rogue ; ye trudge the country leasing ; y ' are heavily suspicioned of the death of severals ."
"How , fellow , are ye so bold ?"
But I will bring you down . ''
"`` Right honourable and my reverend lord , '' the man cried , `` here is some hodge-podge , saving your good presence ."
"I am but a poor private man , and have hurt none . ''"
"`` The under-sheriff did report of you most vilely , '' said the knight . ''"
"` Seize me , ' saith he , ` that Tyndal of Shoreby . ' ''"
"`` Condall , my good lord ; Condall is my poor name , '' said the unfortunate ."
"`` Condall or Tyndal , it is all one , '' replied Sir Daniel , coolly ."
Ride -- ride fast ! ''
And then the poor young lady fainted once again .
"One of Dick 's men carried a flask of some strong cordial , and with this Dick succeeded in reviving consciousness ."
"Then he took Joanna 's friend upon his saddlebow , and once more pushed toward the forest ."
`` Why do ye take me ? ''
said the girl .
`` Ye but delay your speed . ''
"`` Nay , Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick ."
`` Shoreby is full of blood and drunkenness and riot .
Here ye are safe ; content ye . ''
"`` I will not be beholden to any of your faction , '' she cried ; `` set me down . ''"
"`` Madam , ye know not what ye say , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Y ' are hurt '' -- `` I am not , '' she said ."
`` It was my horse was slain . ''
"`` It matters not one jot , '' replied Richard ."
"`` Ye are here in the midst of open snow , and compassed about with enemies ."
"Whether ye will or not , I carry you with me ."
Glad am I to have the occasion ; for thus shall I repay some portion of our debt . ''
For a little while she was silent .
"Then , very suddenly , she asked : `` My uncle ? ''"
`` My Lord Risingham ? ''
returned Dick .
"`` I would I had good news to give you , madam ; but I have none ."
"I saw him once in the battle , and once only ."
Let us hope the best . ''
"CHAPTER V -- NIGHT IN THE WOODS : ALICIA RISINGHAM It was almost certain that Sir Daniel had made for the Moat House ; but , considering the heavy snow , the lateness of the hour , and the necessity under which he would lie of avoiding the few roads and striking across the wood , it was equally certain that he could not hope to reach it ere the morrow ."
"There were two courses open to Dick ; either to continue to follow in the knight 's trail , and , if he were able , to fall upon him that very night in camp , or to strike out a path of his own , and seek to place himself between Sir Daniel and his destination ."
"Either scheme was open to serious objection , and Dick , who feared to expose Joanna to the hazards of a fight , had not yet decided between them when he reached the borders of the wood ."
"At this point Sir Daniel had turned a little to his left , and then plunged straight under a grove of very lofty timber ."
"His party had then formed to a narrower front , in order to pass between the trees , and the track was trod proportionally deeper in the snow ."
"The eye followed it under the leafless tracery of the oaks , running direct and narrow ; the trees stood over it , with knotty joints and the great , uplifted forest of their boughs ; there was no sound , whether of man or beast -- not so much as the stirring of a robin ; and over the field of snow the winter sun lay golden among netted shadows ."
"`` How say ye , '' asked Dick of one of the men , `` to follow straight on , or strike across for Tunstall ? ''"
"And we could hear him adding to himself , `` Cap'n , is it ?"
"My heart , and here 's promotion ! ''"
Long John answered for himself .
"`` Me , sir ."
"These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir '' -- laying a particular emphasis upon the word `` desertion . ''"
"`` We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it ."
"All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . ''"
"`` My man , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I have not the slightest desire to talk to you ."
"If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all ."
"If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . ''"
"`` That 's enough , cap'n , '' shouted Long John cheerily ."
`` A word from you 's enough .
"I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . ''"
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back .
"Nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain 's answer ."
But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd .
"Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side ."
"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand ."
"He was whistling `` Come , Lasses and Lads . ''"
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll .
"What with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays ."
"But he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style ."
"He was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head ."
"`` Here you are , my man , '' said the captain , raising his head ."
`` You had better sit down . ''
"`` You ai n't a-going to let me inside , cap'n ? ''"
complained Long John .
"`` It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . ''"
"`` Why , Silver , '' said the captain , `` if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley ."
It 's your own doing .
"You 're either my ship 's cook -- and then you were treated handsome -- or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! ''"
"`` Well , well , cap'n , '' returned the sea-cook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , `` you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"you said you 'd take good care of me , '' he sighed , as the sun seemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden ."
`` Well I am taking good care of you as hard as I can .
"Do n't be cross , child ; I 'll go in a minute , '' said Nan , who considered five-year-old Robby a mere infant compared to herself ."
"So little Rob sat looking anxiously about him , and waiting patiently , for , spite of some misgivings , he felt great confidence in Nan ."
"`` I guess it 's going to be night pretty soon , '' he observed , as if to himself , as a mosquito bit him , and the frogs in a neighboring marsh began to pipe up for the evening concert ."
`` My goodness me !
so it is .
"Come right away this minute , or they will be gone , '' cried Nan , looking up from her work , and suddenly perceiving that the sun was down ."
"`` I heard a horn about an hour ago ; may be they were blowing for us , '' said Rob , trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill ."
`` Where was it ? ''
"asked Nan , stopping short ."
`` Over that way ; '' he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely wrong direction .
"`` Let 's go that way and meet them ; '' and Nan wheeled about , and began to trot through the bushes , feeling a trifle anxious , for there were so many cow-paths all about she could not remember which way they came ."
"On they went over stock and stone again , pausing now and then to listen for the horn , which did not blow any more , for it was only the moo of a cow on her way home ."
`` I do n't remember seeing that pile of stones do you ? ''
"asked Nan , as she sat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation ."
"`` I do n't remember any thing , but I want to go home , '' and Rob 's voice had a little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him gently down , saying , in her most capable way , `` I 'm going just as fast as I can , dear ."
"Do n't cry , and when we come to the road , I 'll carry you . ''"
`` Where is the road ? ''
and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it .
`` Over by that big tree .
Do n't you know that 's the one Ned tumbled out of ? ''
`` So it is .
May be they waited for us ; I 'd like to ride home would n't you ? ''
and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the great pasture .
"`` No , I 'd rather walk , '' answered Nan , feeling quite sure that she would be obliged to do so , and preparing her mind for it ."
"Another long trudge through the fast-deepening twilight and another disappointment , for when they reached the tree , they found to their dismay that it was not the one Ned climbed , and no road anywhere appeared ."
`` Are we lost ? ''
"quavered Rob , clasping his pail in despair ."
`` Not much .
"I do n't just see which way to go , and I guess we 'd better call . ''"
In a month it had carried Walter 's name to every corner of the globe .
"Everywhere it was copied -- in metropolitan dailies and little village weeklies -- in profound reviews and `` agony columns , '' in Red Cross appeals and Government recruiting propaganda ."
"Mothers and sisters wept over it , young lads thrilled to it , the whole great heart of humanity caught it up as an epitome of all the pain and hope and pity and purpose of the mighty conflict , crystallized in three brief immortal verses ."
A Canadian lad in the Flanders trenches had written the one great poem of the war .
"`` The Piper , '' by Pte. ."
"Walter Blythe , was a classic from its first printing ."
Rilla copied it in her diary at the beginning of an entry in which she poured out the story of the hard week that had just passed .
"`` It has been such a dreadful week , '' she wrote , `` and even though it is over and we know that it was all a mistake that does not seem to do away with the bruises left by it ."
And yet it has in some ways been a very wonderful week and I have had some glimpses of things I never realized before -- of how fine and brave people can be even in the midst of horrible suffering .
I am sure I could never be as splendid as Miss Oliver was .
`` Just a week ago today she had a letter from Mr. Grant 's mother in Charlottetown .
And it told her that a cable had just come saying that Major Robert Grant had been killed in action a few days before .
"`` Oh , poor Gertrude !"
At first she was crushed .
Then after just a day she pulled herself together and went back to her school .
"She did not cry -- I never saw her shed a tear -- but oh , her face and her eyes ! '' '"
"I must go on with my work , ' she said ."
` That is my duty just now . '
`` I could never have risen to such a height .
"`` She never spoke bitterly except once , when Susan said something about spring being here at last , and Gertrude said , '' ` Can the spring really come this year ? '"
"`` Then she laughed -- such a dreadful little laugh , just as one might laugh in the face of death , I think , and said , '' ` Observe my egotism ."
"Because I , Gertrude Oliver , have lost a friend , it is incredible that the spring can come as usual ."
"The spring does not fail because of the million agonies of others -- but for mine -- oh , can the universe go on ? ' ''"
"` Do n't feel bitter with yourself , dear , ' mother said gently ."
` It is a very natural thing to feel as if things could n't go on just the same when some great blow has changed the world for us .
We all feel like that . '
`` Then that horrid old Cousin Sophia of Susan 's piped up .
"She was sitting there , knitting and croaking like an old ` raven of bode and woe ' as Walter used to call her . ''"
"` You ai n't as bad off as some , Miss Oliver , ' she said , ` and you should n't take it so hard ."
There 's some as has lost their husbands ; that 's a hard blow ; and there 's some as has lost their sons .
You have n't lost either husband or son . ' ''
"` No , ' said Gertrude , more bitterly still ."
"When the Queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away , and then everybody adjourns to the dance , the Queen walking in front while the Lord Chamberlain walks behind her , carrying two little pots , one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of Solomon 's Seal ."
"Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit , and Solomon 's Seal juice is for bruises ."
"They bruise very easily , and when Peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits ."
"For , as you know without my telling you , Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra ."
"He sits in the middle of the ring , and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him ."
` P. P. ' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families .
"They are grateful little people , too , and at the princess 's coming-of-age ball -LRB- they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month -RRB- they gave him the wish of his heart ."
-LSB- Illustration : When her Majesty wants to know the time -RSB- The way it was done was this .
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"` If I chose to go back to mother , ' he asked at last , ` could you give me that wish ? '"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , ` Pooh !"
ask for a much bigger wish than that . '
` Is that quite a little wish ? '
he inquired .
"` As little as this , ' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
` What size is a big wish ? '
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , ` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . '"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way . '"
"I can give you the power to fly to her house , ' the Queen said , ` but I ca n't open the door for you . '"
"` The window I flew out at will be open , ' Peter said confidently ."
` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back . '
` How do you know ? '
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew . '"
"I just do know , ' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part , and then up he rose higher and higher , and flew away out of the Gardens and over the housetops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
These terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of .
Even Mother could not do anything with him when he was like that .
You must go away now -- and do not come back until his dark mood has passed .
"He will be just as glad to see you as ever then , and this will not make any difference with him ."
Do n't come back for a week at least . ''
"`` I do not like to leave you in such trouble , Miss Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , it does n't matter about me -- I have Emily ."
And there is nothing you could do .
Please go at once .
Father knows I am talking to you and that will vex him still more . ''
"Alan , realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only made matters worse , went away perplexedly ."
The following week was a miserable one for him .
His duties were distasteful to him and meeting his people a positive torture .
Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously at him and seemed on the point of saying something -- but never said it .
"Isabel King watched him when they met , with bold probing eyes ."
In his abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation -- as if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their confidence and trust .
Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly conscious of this slight chill ; now he was not even aware of it .
When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht .
"He was urbane and friendly , utterly ignoring the incident of Alan 's last visit and regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake ."
"Alan saw him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde , who was walking under the pines with her dogs ."
"She looked pale and tired and her eyes were still troubled , but she smiled proudly and made no reference to what had happened ."
"`` I 'm going to put these flowers on Mother 's grave , '' she said , lifting her slender hands filled with late white roses ."
`` Mother loved flowers and I always keep them near her when I can .
You may come with me if you like . ''
Alan had known Lynde 's mother was buried under the pines but he had never visited the spot before .
"The grave was at the westernmost end of the pine wood , where it gave out on the lake , a beautiful spot , given over to silence and shadow ."
"`` Mother wished to be buried here , '' Lynde said , kneeling to arrange her flowers ."
`` Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well .
Father buried her himself .
He would n't have anyone else do anything for her .
I am so glad she is here .
It would have been terrible to have seen her taken far away -- my sweet little mother . ''
"Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- , and she accepted them with a disturbing smile ."
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by and by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying ` Hsh !
what was that ? '
"Tony beseeches her , ` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! '"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
` It is coming nearer ! '
she cries .
"` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , O Tony , oh ! '"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly -- not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed . '"
"O Tony , ' she would say with awful respect , ` but the fairies will be so angry ! ' '"
"I dare say , ' replied Tony carelessly ."
"` Perhaps , ' she said , thrilling , ` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ' '"
"I shall make him , ' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They all tickled him on the shoulder -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace , and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , ` Just some day ' ; he was quite vague about which day except when she asked , ` Will it be to-day ? '"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond ; not thick enough to skate on , but at least you could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
If he spent a shilling he got back a florin-such an excellent merchant he was till he died .
Now his son inherited all this money .
"He lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five-pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones ."
"In this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did ."
"At last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing-gown ."
His friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him .
"But one of them who was rather good-natured sent him an old trunk with the message , ` Pack up ! ''"
"That was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself ."
"It was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly ."
"He pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away ."
"But whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault-just think of it !"
In this way he arrived at the land of the Turks .
"He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves , and then walked into the town ."
"He could do that quite well , for all the Turks were dressed just as he was-in a dressing-gown and slippers ."
He met a nurse with a little child .
` Halloa !
"you Turkish nurse , ' said he , ` what is that great castle there close to the town ?"
The one with the windows so high up ? '
"` The sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied ."
"` It is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by . '"
"` Thank you , ' said the merchant 's son , and he went into the wood , sat himself in his trunk , flew on to the roof , and crept through the window into the princess 's room ."
"She was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her ."
"Then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a Turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much ."
"They sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes ."
They were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids .
"And her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining ."
These were lovely stories .
"Then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once ."
"` But you must come here on Saturday , ' she said , ` for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me ."
They will be indeed proud that I receive the god of the Turks .
"But mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely ."
"My mother likes something rather moral and high-flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh . '"
A singular sneer played about the young nobleman 's mouth as he made answer : `` These are very brave words .
But to the more essential -- are ye Lancaster or York ? ''
"`` My lord , I make no secret ; I am clear for York , '' Dick answered ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"replied the other , `` it is well for you . ''"
"And so saying , he turned towards one of his followers ."
"`` Let me see , '' he continued , in the same sneering and cruel tones -- `` let me see a clean end of these brave gentlemen ."
Truss me them up . ''
There were but five survivors of the attacking party .
"Archers seized them by the arms ; they were hurried to the borders of the wood , and each placed below a tree of suitable dimension ; the rope was adjusted ; an archer , carrying the end of it , hastily clambered overhead ; and before a minute was over , and without a word passing upon either hand , the five men were swinging by the neck ."
"`` And now , '' cried the deformed leader , `` back to your posts , and when I summon you next , be readier to attend . ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said one man , `` beseech you , tarry not here alone ."
Keep but a handful of lances at your hand . ''
"`` Fellow , '' said the duke , `` I have forborne to chide you for your slowness ."
"Cross me not , therefore ."
"I trust my hand and arm , for all that I be crooked ."
Ye were backward when the trumpet sounded ; and ye are now too forward with your counsels .
But it is ever so ; last with the lance and first with tongue .
Let it be reversed . ''
"And with a gesture that was not without a sort of dangerous nobility , he waved them off ."
"The footmen climbed again to their seats behind the men-at-arms , and the whole party moved slowly away and disappeared in twenty different directions , under the cover of the forest ."
"The day was by this time beginning to break , and the stars to fade ."
"The first grey glimmer of dawn shone upon the countenances of the two young men , who now turned once more to face each other ."
"`` Here , '' said the duke , `` ye have seen my vengeance , which is , like my blade , both sharp and ready ."
"But I would not have you , for all Christendom , suppose me thankless ."
You that came to my aid with a good sword and a better courage -- unless that ye recoil from my misshapenness -- come to my heart . ''
"And so saying , the young leader held out his arms for an embrace ."
"In the bottom of his heart Dick already entertained a great terror and some hatred for the man whom he had rescued ; but the invitation was so worded that it would not have been merely discourteous , but cruel , to refuse or hesitate ; and he hastened to comply ."
"`` And now , my lord duke , '' he said , when he had regained his freedom , `` do I suppose aright ?"
Are ye my Lord Duke of Gloucester ? ''
"`` I am Richard of Gloucester , '' returned the other ."
`` And you -- how call they you ? ''
"The little wild creatures peeped at him from beneath the bushes , and he nodded and smiled , and wished them ` Good-morning . '"
After he had been walking for some time he met an old white-bearded man who was coming along the footpath .
"The boy would not step aside , and the man was determined not to do so either , so they ran against one another with a bump ."
"` It seems to me , ' said the old fellow , ` that a boy should give way to an old man . '"
"` The path is for me as well as for you , ' answered young Hans saucily , for he had never been taught politeness ."
"` Well , that 's true enough , ' answered the other mildly ."
` And where are you going ? ' '
"I am going into service , ' said Hans ."
"` Then you can come and serve me , ' replied the man ."
"Well , Hans could do that ; but what would his wages be ?"
"` Two pounds a year , and nothing to do but keep some rooms clean , ' said the new-comer ."
"This seemed to Hans to be easy enough ; so he agreed to enter the old man 's service , and they set out together ."
"On their way they crossed a deep valley and came to a mountain , where the man opened a trapdoor , and bidding Hans follow him , he crept in and began to go down a long flight of steps ."
When they got to the bottom Hans saw a large number of rooms lit by many lamps and full of beautiful things .
While he was looking round the old man said to him : ` Now you know what you have to do .
"You must keep these rooms clean , and strew sand on the floor every day ."
"Here is a table where you will always find food and drink , and there is your bed ."
"You see there are a great many suits of clothes hanging on the wall , and you may wear any you please ; but remember that you are never to open this locked door ."
If you do ill will befall you .
"Farewell , for I am going away again and can not tell when I may return ."
"No sooner had the old man disappeared than Hans sat down to a good meal , and after that went to bed and slept until the morning ."
"At first he could not remember what had happened to him , but by-and-by he jumped up and went into all the rooms , which he examined carefully ."
"` How foolish to bid me to put sand on the floors , ' he thought , ` when there is nobody here by myself !"
I shall do nothing of the sort . '
"And so he shut the doors quickly , and only cleaned and set in order his own room ."
"And after the first few days he felt that that was unnecessary too , because no one came there to see if the rooms where clean or not ."
"At last he did no work at all , but just sat and wondered what was behind the locked door , till he determined to go and look for himself ."
The key turned easily in the lock .
"Hans entered , half frightened at what he was doing , and the first thing he beheld was a heap of bones ."
That was not very cheerful ; and he was just going out again when his eye fell on a shelf of books .
"Here was a good way of passing the time , he thought , for he was fond of reading , and he took one of the books from the shelf ."
"It was all about magic , and told you how you could change yourself into anything in the world you liked ."
I 'LL keel-haul him ! ''
"All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner ."
"My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly ."
"But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver ."
"`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' said he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ?"
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ?
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum !
Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights !
"Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n ."
"You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
I see that when you first come in .
"Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ?"
"When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something ."
`` The score ! ''
he burst out .
`` Three goes o ' rum !
"Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! ''"
"And falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks ."
"I could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again ."
"`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I am ! ''"
"he said at last , wiping his cheeks ."
"`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy ."
"But come now , stand by to go about ."
This wo n't do .
"Dooty is dooty , messmates ."
"I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair ."
"For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit ."
"Nor you neither , says you ; not smart -- none of the pair of us smart ."
But dash my buttons !
That was a good un about my score . ''
"And he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I did not see the joke as he did , I was again obliged to join him in his mirth ."
"On our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forward -- how one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for sea -- and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly ."
"I was dead weary , deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings ; the chill of the wind went through me , and the sound of it confused my ears ."
In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution .
"He spoke a good deal , and never without a taunt ."
`` Whig '' was the best name he had to give me .
"`` Here , '' he would say , `` here 's a dub for ye to jump , my Whiggie !"
I ken you 're a fine jumper ! ''
And so on ; all the time with a gibing voice and face .
"I knew it was my own doing , and no one else 's ; but I was too miserable to repent ."
"I felt I could drag myself but little farther ; pretty soon , I must lie down and die on these wet mountains like a sheep or a fox , and my bones must whiten there like the bones of a beast ."
"My head was light perhaps ; but I began to love the prospect , I began to glory in the thought of such a death , alone in the desert , with the wild eagles besieging my last moments ."
"Alan would repent then , I thought ; he would remember , when I was dead , how much he owed me , and the remembrance would be torture ."
"So I went like a sick , silly , and bad-hearted schoolboy , feeding my anger against a fellow-man , when I would have been better on my knees , crying on God for mercy ."
"And at each of Alan 's taunts , I hugged myself ."
`` Ah ! ''
"thinks I to myself , `` I have a better taunt in readiness ; when I lie down and die , you will feel it like a buffet in your face ; ah , what a revenge !"
"ah , how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty ! ''"
"All the while , I was growing worse and worse ."
"Once I had fallen , my leg simply doubling under me , and this had struck Alan for the moment ; but I was afoot so briskly , and set off again with such a natural manner , that he soon forgot the incident ."
"Flushes of heat went over me , and then spasms of shuddering ."
The stitch in my side was hardly bearable .
"At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther : and with that , there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan , let my anger blaze , and be done with my life in a more sudden manner ."
He had just called me `` Whig . ''
I stopped .
"`` Mr. Stewart , '' said I , in a voice that quivered like a fiddle-string , `` you are older than I am , and should know your manners ."
Do you think it either very wise or very witty to cast my politics in my teeth ?
"I thought , where folk differed , it was the part of gentlemen to differ civilly ; and if I did not , I may tell you I could find a better taunt than some of yours . ''"
"Alan had stopped opposite to me , his hat cocked , his hands in his breeches pockets , his head a little on one side ."
"He listened , smiling evilly , as I could see by the starlight ; and when I had done he began to whistle a Jacobite air ."
"It was the air made in mockery of General Cope 's defeat at Preston Pans : `` Hey , Johnnie Cope , are ye waukin ' yet ?"
And are your drums a-beatin ' yet ? ''
"And it came in my mind that Alan , on the day of that battle , had been engaged upon the royal side ."
"`` Why do ye take that air , Mr. Stewart ? ''"
"` It shall be done , ' answered the youth ; ` but you must give me two years to manage it , for my beard must grow so that he may not know me . '"
"` So be it , ' said the king ."
"And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to take the road to the dragon 's house and on the way he met a beggar , whom he persuaded to change clothes with him , and in the beggar 's garments he went fearlessly forth to the dragon ."
"He found his enemy before his house , very busy making a box , and addressed him politely , ` Good morning , your worship ."
Have you a morsel of bread ? '
"` You must wait , ' replied the dragon , 'till I have finished my box , and then I will see if I can find one . '"
` What will you do with the box when it is made ? '
inquired the beggar .
"` It is for the young man who killed my wife , and stole my flying horse and my bed covering , ' said the dragon ."
"` He deserves nothing better , ' answered the beggar , ` for it was an ill deed ."
"Still that box is too small for him , for he is a big man . '"
"` You are wrong , ' said the dragon ."
` The box is large enough even for me . '
"` Well , the rogue is nearly as tall as you , ' replied the beggar , ` and , of course , if you can get in , he can ."
But I am sure you would find it a tight fit . '
"` No , there is plenty of room , ' said the dragon , tucking himself carefully inside ."
"But no sooner was he well in , than the young man clapped on the lid and called out , ` Now press hard , just to see if he will be able to get out . '"
"The dragon pressed as hard as he could , but the lid never moved ."
"` It is all right , ' he cried ; ` now you can open it . '"
"But instead of opening it , the young man drove in long nails to make it tighter still ; then he took the box on his back and brought it to the king ."
"And when the king heard that the dragon was inside , he was so excited that he would not wait one moment , but broke the lock and lifted the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there ."
"He was very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out , but unluckily there was just room for his great mouth , and with one snap the king vanished down his wide red jaws ."
"Then the young man married the king 's daughter and ruled over the land , but what he did with the dragon nobody knows ."
The Goblin and the Grocer Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
"There was once a hard-working student who lived in an attic , and he had nothing in the world of his own ."
"There was also a hard-working grocer who lived on the first floor , and he had the whole house for his own ."
"The Goblin belonged to him , for every Christmas Eve there was waiting for him at the grocer 's a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the middle ."
"The grocer could afford this , so the Goblin stayed in the grocer 's shop ; and this teaches us a good deal ."
"One evening the student came in by the back door to buy a candle and some cheese ; he had no one to send , so he came himself ."
"He got what he wanted , paid for it , and nodded a good evening to the grocer and his wife -LRB- she was a woman who could do more than nod ; she could talk -RRB- ."
"When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still , reading the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped ."
It was a leaf torn out of an old book -- a book of poetry ` There 's more of that over there ! '
So he bade them farewell and set out .
"For three days he wandered by the most out-of-the-way paths , but no signs of a tower were to be seen anywhere ."
"On the fourth morning it was just the same , and , filled with despair , he flung himself on the ground under a tree and hid his face in his hands ."
"In a little while he heard a rustling over his head , and looking up , he saw a turtle dove watching him with her bright eyes ."
` Oh dove ! '
"cried the boy , addressing the bird in her own language , ` Oh dove !"
"tell me , I pray you , where is the castle of Come-and-never-go ? '"
"` Poor child , ' answered the dove , ` who has sent you on such a useless quest ? '"
"` My good or evil fortune , ' replied the boy , ' I know not which . '"
"` To get there , ' said the dove , ` you must follow the wind , which to-day is blowing towards the castle . '"
"The boy thanked her , and followed the wind , fearing all the time that it might change its direction and lead him astray ."
But the wind seemed to feel pity for him and blew steadily on .
"With each step the country became more and more dreary , but at nightfall the child could see behind the dark and bare rocks something darker still ."
"This was the tower in which dwelt the witch ; and seizing the knocker he gave three loud knocks , which were echoed in the hollows of the rocks around ."
"The door opened slowly , and there appeared on the threshold an old woman holding up a candle to her face , which was so hideous that the boy involuntarily stepped backwards , almost as frightened by the troop of lizards , beetles and such creatures that surrounded her , as by the woman herself ."
` Who are you who dare to knock at my door and wake me ? '
cried she .
"` Be quick and tell me what you want , or it will be the worse for you . '"
"` Madam , ' answered the child , ' I believe that you alone know the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and I pray you to show it to me . '"
"` Very good , ' replied the witch , with something that she meant for a smile , ` but to-day it is late ."
To-morrow you shall go .
"Now enter , and you shall sleep with my lizards . ' '"
"I can not stay , ' said he . '"
"I must go back at once , so as to reach the road from which I started before day dawns . '"
"` If I tell you , will you promise me that you will bring me this jar full of the many-coloured water from the spring in the court-yard of the castle ? '"
asked she .
` If you fail to keep your word I will change you into a lizard for ever . ' '
"I promise , ' answered the boy ."
"Then the old woman called to a very thin dog , and said to him : ` Conduct this pig of a child to the castle of Come-and-never-go , and take care that you warn my friend of his arrival . '"
"And the dog arose and shook itself , and set out ."
"At the end of two hours they stopped in front of a large castle , big and black and gloomy , whose doors stood wide open , although neither sound nor light gave sign of any presence within ."
"The dog , however , seemed to know what to expect , and , after a wild howl , went on ; but the boy , who was uncertain whether this was the quarter of an hour when the giant was asleep , hesitated to follow him , and paused for a moment under a wild olive that grew near by , the only tree which he had beheld since he had parted from the dove ."
"till you wondered that it was not out of breath , or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage ."
"`` Now , that bird , '' he would say , `` is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins -- they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself ."
"She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate ."
"She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello ."
She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships .
"It 's there she learned ` Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins !"
"She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby ."
"But you smelt powder -- did n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"`` Stand by to go about , '' the parrot would scream ."
"`` Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , '' the cook would say , and give her sugar from his pocket , and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on , passing belief for wickedness ."
"`` There , '' John would add , `` you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad ."
"Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that ."
"She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . ''"
And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men .
"In the meantime , the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another ."
The squire made no bones about the matter ; he despised the captain .
"The captain , on his part , never spoke but when he was spoken to , and then sharp and short and dry , and not a word wasted ."
"He owned , when driven into a corner , that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew , that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well ."
"As for the ship , he had taken a downright fancy to her ."
"`` She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir ."
"But , '' he would add , `` all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . ''"
"The squire , at this , would turn away and march up and down the deck , chin in air ."
"`` A trifle more of that man , '' he would say , `` and I shall explode . ''"
"We had some heavy weather , which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA ."
"Every man on board seemed well content , and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise , for it is my belief there was never a ship 's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea ."
"Double grog was going on the least excuse ; there was duff on odd days , as , for instance , if the squire heard it was any man 's birthday , and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy ."
"`` Never knew good come of it yet , '' the captain said to Dr. Livesey ."
"`` Spoil forecastle hands , make devils ."
That 's my belief . ''
"But good did come of the apple barrel , as you shall hear , for if it had not been for that , we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery ."
This was how it came about .
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after -- I am not allowed to be more plain -- and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night .
asked Jose .
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call the little fish whose life you saved , and she will bring it to you . '"
"So he called to the fish , and the fish dived to the bottom and slipped behind big stones , and moved little ones with its tail till it found the ring , and brought it to Jose in its mouth ."
"Well pleased with all he had done , Jose returned to the palace ; but when the king took the precious objects to Bella-Flor , she declared that she would never open her door till the bandit who had carried her off had been fried in oil . '"
"I am very sorry , ' said the king to Jose , ' I really would rather not ; but you see I have no choice . '"
"While the oil was being heated in the great caldron , Jose went to the stables to inquire of his friend the horse if there was no way for him to escape ."
"` Do not be frightened , ' said the horse ."
"` Get on my back , and I will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . '"
"Jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil ."
He was left there till Bella-Flor cried that he must be cooked enough .
"Then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and Bella-Flor most of all ."
"As for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of Jose ."
"Then Jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married Bella-Flor which he promised to do the next day ."
"But first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ` It is to you that I owe my life and my crown ."
Why have you done all this for me ? '
And the horse answered : ' I am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune .
"And when I saw you in danger of death I begged that I might help you , as you had helped me ."
"For , as I told you , Good deeds bear their own fruit ! '"
"The Bird of Truth -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones , y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
"Once upon a time there lived a poor fisher who built a hut on the banks of a stream which , shunning the glare of the sun and the noise of the towns , flowed quietly past trees and under bushes , listening to the songs of the birds overhead ."
"One day , when the fisherman had gone out as usual to cast his nets , he saw borne towards him on the current a cradle of crystal ."
Slipping his net quickly beneath it he drew it out and lifted the silk coverlet .
"Inside , lying on a soft bed of cotton , were two babies , a boy and a girl , who opened their eyes and smiled at him ."
"The man was filled with pity at the sight , and throwing down his lines he took the cradle and the babies home to his wife ."
The good woman flung up her hands in despair when she beheld the contents of the cradle .
"` Are not eight children enough , ' she cried , ` without bringing us two more ?"
How do you think we can feed them ? '
"` You would not have had me leave them to die of hunger , ' answered he , ` or be swallowed up by the waves of the sea ?"
What is enough for eight is also enough for ten . '
The wife said no more ; and in truth her heart yearned over the little creatures .
"Somehow or other food was never lacking in the hut , and the children grew up and were so good and gentle that , in time , their foster-parents loved them as well or better than their own , who were quarrelsome and envious ."
"It did not take the orphans long to notice that the boys did not like them , and were always playing tricks on them , so they used to go away by themselves and spend whole hours by the banks of the river ."
"` No , I did not , ' she answered ; ` the girl went off with your dinner ."
"She must have lost her way , but will no doubt come back to-morrow . '"
"But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood , and this time asked his second daughter to bring his food . '"
"I will take a bag of lentils , ' said he ; ` they are larger than millet , and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way . '"
"At midday the maiden took the food , but the lentils had all gone ; as on the previous day , the wood birds had eaten them all ."
"The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall , when she came in the same way to the old man 's house , and asked for food and a night 's lodging ."
"The man with the white hair again asked the beasts : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The beasts answered , ` Duks , ' and everything happened as on the former day ."
"The girl cooked a good meal , ate and drank with the old man , and did not trouble herself about the animals ."
"And when she asked for a bed , they replied : You have eaten with him You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Now sleep as you ought !"
"And when she was asleep , the old man shook his head over her , and let her fall into the cellar ."
"On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife , ` Send our youngest child to-day with my dinner ."
"She is always good and obedient , and will keep to the right path , and not wander away like her sisters , idle drones ! '"
"But the mother said , ` Must I lose my dearest child too ? '"
"` Do not fear , ' he answered ; ` she is too clever and intelligent to lose her way ."
"I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along ; they are even larger than lentils , and will show her the way . '"
"But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm , the wood pigeons had eaten up the peas , and she did not know which way to go ."
"She was much distressed , and thought constantly of her poor hungry father and her anxious mother ."
"At last , when it grew dark , she saw the little light , and came to the house in the wood ."
"She asked prettily if she might stay there for the night , and the man with the white beard asked his beasts again : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' they said ."
"Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the animals were lying , and stroked the cock and the hen , and scratched the brindled cow between its horns ."
"And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper , and the dishes were standing on the table , she said , ` Shall I have plenty while the good beasts have nothing ?"
There is food to spare outside ; I will attend to them first . '
"Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and hen , and brought the cow an armful of sweet-smelling hay ."
"` Eat that , dear beasts , ' she said , ' and when you are thirsty you shall have a good drink . '"
"Then she fetched a bowl of water , and the cock and hen flew on to the edge , put their beaks in , and then held up their heads as birds do when they drink , and the brindled cow also drank her fill ."
"When the beasts were satisfied , the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and ate what was left for her ."
"Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their heads under their wings , and the brindled cow blinked its eyes , so the maiden said , ` Shall we not go to rest now ? '"
"Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"The animals said , ` Duks : You have eaten with us , You have drunk with us , You have tended us right , So we wish you good night . '"
"The maiden therefore went upstairs , made the bed and put on clean sheets and fell asleep ."
"So one day, 'twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire, busy with this thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should he see but a great big White Bear."
"""Good-evening to you!"" said the White Bear."
"""The same to you!"" said the man."
"""Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I'll make you as rich as you are now poor,"" said the Bear."
"Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich; but still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a great White Bear waiting outside, who had given his word to make them so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter."
"The lassie said ""No!"" outright. Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the White Bear that he should come again the next Thursday evening and get an answer."
"Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at last she thought better of it, and washed and mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to start. I can't say her packing gave her much trouble."
"Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear said:"
"""Are you afraid?"""
"""No,"" she wasn't."
"""Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and then there's nothing to fear,"" said the Bear."
"So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill."
"There, on the face of it, the White Bear gave a knock, and a door opened, and they came into a castle where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold; and there, too, was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White Bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it at once."
"Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell; and she had scarce taken hold of it before she came into a chamber where there was a bed made, as fair and white as any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast shape at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things went on happily for a while, but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful; for there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the White Bear asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters, and that was why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn't get to them."
"""Well, well!"" said the Bear, ""perhaps there's a cure for all this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but only when the rest are by to hear; for she'll take you by the hand and try to lead you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you'll bring bad luck on both of us."""
"So one Sunday the White Bear came and said, now they could set off to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and they went far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and there her brothers and sisters were running about out of doors at play, and everything was so pretty, 'twas a joy to see."
"""This is where your father and mother live now,"" said the White Bear; ""but don't forget what I told you, else you'll make us both unlucky."""
"""No! bless her, she'd not forget;"" and when she had reached the house, the White Bear turned right about and left her."
"Then, when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted to know how she got on where she lived."
"Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What she said beside I don't know, but I don't think any of them had the right end of the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so, in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her bedroom; but she minded what the White Bear had said, and wouldn't go upstairs."
"""Oh! what we have to talk about will keep!"" she said, and put her mother off. But, somehow or other, her mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how every night when she had gone to bed a man came and lay down beside her as soon as she had put out the light; and how she never saw him, because he was always up and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about woeful and sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him; and how all day long she walked about there alone; and how dull and dreary and lonesome it was."
"""My!"" said her mother; ""it may well be a Troll you slept with! But now I'll teach you a lesson how to set eyes on him. I'll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him."""
"Yes! she took the candle and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the White Bear came and fetched her away."
"But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White Bear asked if all hadn't happened as he had said."
"""Well, she couldn't say it hadn't."""
"""Now, mind,"" said he, ""if you have listened to your mother's advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed between us will be as nothing."""
"""No,"" she said, ""she hadn't listened to her mother's advice."""
"So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There came a man and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw that he was the loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with him on the spot, that she thought she couldn't live if she didn't give him a kiss there and then. And so she did; but as she kissed him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt, and he woke up."
"""What have you done?"" he cried; ""now you have made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a step-mother who has bewitched me, so that I am a White Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells long, and she's the wife I must have now."""
"She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it; go he must."
Then she asked if she mightn't go with him.
"Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom."
"""Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,"" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor."
THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY
"Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons, and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be with him. Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came to a King who had six daughters; such lovely king's daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts."
"But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the Giant's house was, and there the Giant came out, and set his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone, princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad again."
"""And if I had not you left,"" he said to Boots, ""I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers."""
"""Well, but now I've been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again; that's what I'm thinking of,"" said Boots."
"""Nay, nay!"" said his father; ""that leave you shall never get, for then you would stay away too."""
"But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his sorry old steed."
"""Farewell, father,"" said he; ""I'll come back, never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me;"" and with that he rode off."
"So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Raven, ""give me a little food, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""I haven't much food,"" said the Prince, ""and I don't see how you'll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it."""
So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.
"Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into the water again."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Salmon to the Prince; ""shove me out into the water again, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""Well!"" said the Prince, ""the help you'll give me will not be great, I daresay, but it's a pity you should lie there and choke;"" and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again."
"After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly."
"""Dear friend, do let me have your horse,"" said the Wolf; ""I'm so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I've had nothing to eat these two years."""
"""No,"" said Boots, ""this will never do; first I came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can't be done, that it can't, for then I should have nothing to ride on."""
"""Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,"" said Graylegs the wolf; ""you can ride upon my back, and I'll help you again in your utmost need."""
"""Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great, I'll be bound,"" said the Prince; ""but you may take my horse, since you are in such need."""
"So when the Wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolf's jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the Wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before."
"""When we have gone a bit farther,"" said Graylegs, ""I'll show you the Giant's house."""
So after a while they came to it.
"""See, here is the Giant's house,"" said the Wolf; ""and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go."""
"""Nay, but I daren't go in,"" said the Prince; ""he'll take my life."""
"""No! no!"" said the Wolf; ""when you get in you'll find a Princess, and she'll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you."""
"Well! Boots went in, but, truth to say, he was very much afraid."
"When he came in the Giant was away, but in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the Wolf had said, and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on."
"""Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?"" said the Princess, as she saw him; ""it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his body."""
"Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the castle; and when the King heard the woman's grief and its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the child, and see if he couldn't save it."
"So the months went on and on, and when her time came the fisher's wife had a boy; so the king took it at once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad grew up. Then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he said. At first the King wouldn't hear of it, but at last the lad had his way, and went. So he and his father were out the whole day, and all went right and well till they landed at night. Then the lad remembered he had left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off with him at such speed that the water roared under the bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it with the oars was no use; so he went and went the whole night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away."
"There he went ashore, and when he had walked about a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard."
"""What's the name of this land?"" asked the lad."
"""Whiteland,"" said the man, who went on to ask the lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. So the lad told him all."
"""Aye, aye!"" said the man; ""now when you have walked a little farther along the strand here, you'll come to three Princesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. Then the first she is the eldest will call out and beg you so prettily to come and help her; and the second will do the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything. But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks. If you do this, you'll have good luck that's all."""
"When the lad came to the first Princess, she called out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her, but he passed on as though he saw her not. In the same way he passed by the second; but to the third he went straight up."
"""If you'll do what I bid you,"" she said, ""you may have which of us you please."""
"""Yes;"" he was willing enough; so she told him how three Trolls had set them down in the earth there; but before they had lived in the castle up among the trees."
"""Now,"" she said, ""you must go into that castle, and let the Trolls whip you each one night for each of us. If you can bear that, you'll set us free."""
"Well, the lad said he was ready to try."
"""When you go in,"" the Princess went on to say, ""you'll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you'll only go right in the middle between them they'll do you no harm. Then go straight on into a little dark room, and make your bed. Then the Troll will come to whip you; but if you take the flask which hangs on the wall, and rub yourself with the ointment that's in it, wherever his lash falls, you'll be as sound as ever. Then grasp the sword that hangs by the side of the flask and strike the Troll dead."""
"Yes, he did as the Princess told him; he passed in the midst between the lions, as if he hadn't seen them, and went straight into the little room, and there he lay down to sleep. The first night there came a Troll with three heads and three rods, and whipped the lad soundly; but he stood it till the Troll was done; then he took the flask and rubbed himself, and grasped the sword and slew the Troll."
"So, when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth up to their waists."
"The next night 'twas the same story over again, only this time the Troll had six heads and six rods, and he whipped him far worse than the first; but when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth as far as the knee."
"The third night there came a Troll that had nine heads and nine rods, and he whipped and flogged the lad so long that he fainted away; then the Troll took him up and dashed him against the wall; but the shock brought down the flask, which fell on the lad, burst, and spilled the ointment all over him, and so he became as strong and sound as ever again. Then he wasn't slow; he grasped the sword and slew the Troll; and next morning when he went out of the castle the Princesses stood before him with all their bodies out of the earth."
"So he took the youngest for his Queen, and lived well and happily with her for some time."
At last he began to long to go home for a little to see his parents.
"His Queen did not like this; but at last his heart was so set on it, and he longed and longed so much, there was no holding him back, so she said:"
"""One thing you must promise me. This only to do what your father begs you to do, and not what mother wishes;"" and that he promised."
"Then she gave him a ring, which was of that kind that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. So he wished himself home, and when he got home his parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their son had become."
"Now, when he had been at home some days, his mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the King what a fine fellow he had come to be. But his father said:"
"""No! don't let him do that; if he does, we shan't have any more joy of him this time."""
"But it was no good, the mother begged and prayed so long that at last he went. So when he got up to the palace he was far braver, both in clothes and array, than the other king, who didn't quite like this, and at last he said:"
"""All very fine; but here you can see my Queen, what like she is, but I can't see yours: that I can't. Do you know, I scarce think she's so good-looking as mine."""
"""Would to Heaven,"" said the young King, ""she were standing here, then you'd see what she was like."" And that instant there she stood before them."
"But she was very woeful, and said to him:"
"""Why did you not mind what I told you; and why did you not listen to what your father said? Now, I must away home, and as for you, you have had both your wishes."""
"With that she knitted a ring among his hair with her name on it, and wished herself home, and was off."
"Then the young King was cut to the heart, and went, day out day in, thinking and thinking how he should get back to his Queen. ""I'll just try,"" he thought, ""if I can't learn where Whiteland lies;"" and so he went out into the world to ask. So when he had gone a good way, he came to a high hill, and there he met one who was lord over all the beasts of the wood, for they all came home to him when he blew his horn; so the King asked if he knew where Whiteland was."
"""No, I don't,"" said he, ""but I'll ask my beasts."" Then he blew his horn and called them, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay. But there was no beast that knew."
131 Fair Katrinelje and Pif-Paf-Poltrie
"“Good-day, Father Hollenthe.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Mother Malcho (Milch-cow), Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.”"
"“Where is Mother Malcho, then?” “She is in the cow-house, milking the cow.”"
"“Good-day, Mother Malcho.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your daughter?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Brother High-and-Mighty, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Brother High-and-Mighty, then?” “He is in the room chopping some wood.” “Good-day, Brother High-and-Mighty.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Sister Käsetraut, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you can have her.” “Where is Sister Käsetraut, then?” “She is in the garden cutting cabbages.” “Good-day, sister Käsetraut.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “May I be allowed to have your sister?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and fair Katrinelje are willing, you may have her.”"
"“Where is fair Katrinelje, then?” “She is in the room counting out her farthings.” “Good day, fair Katrinelje.” “Many thanks, Pif-paf-poltrie.” “Wilt thou be my bride?” “Oh, yes, if Father Hollenthe, Mother Malcho, Brother High-and-Mighty, and Sister Käsetraut are willing, I am ready.”"
"“Fair Katrinelje, how much dowry do hast thou?” “Fourteen farthings in ready money, three and a half groschen owing to me, half a pound of dried apples, a handful of fried bread, and a handful of spices."
"And many other things are mine, Have I not a dowry fine?"
"“Pif-paf-poltrie, what is thy trade? Art thou a tailor?” “Something better.” “A shoemaker?” “Something better.” “A husbandman?” “Something better.” “A joiner?” “Something better.” “A smith?” “Something better.”"
"“A miller?” “Something better.” “Perhaps a broom-maker?” “Yes, that’s what I am, is it not a fine trade?”"
132 The Fox and the Horse
"A peasant had a faithful horse which had grown old and could do no more work, so his master would no longer give him anything to eat and said, “I can certainly make no more use of thee, but still I mean well by thee; if thou provest thyself still strong enough to bring me a lion here, I will maintain thee, but now take thyself away out of my stable,” and with that he chased him into the open country. The horse was sad, and went to the forest to seek a little protection there from the weather. Then the fox met him and said, “Why dost thou hang thy head so, and go about all alone?” “Alas,” replied the horse, “avarice and fidelity do not dwell together in one house. My master has forgotten what services I have performed for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plough well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out.” “Without giving thee a chance?” asked the fox. “The chance was a bad one. He said, if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion, he would keep me, but he well knows that I cannot do that.”"
"The fox said, “I will help thee, just lay thyself down, stretch thyself out, as if thou wert dead, and do not stir.” The horse did as the fox desired, and the fox went to the lion, who had his den not far off, and said, “A dead horse is lying outside there, just come with me, thou canst have a rich meal.” The lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse the fox said, “After all, it is not very comfortable for thee here I tell thee what I will fasten it to thee by the tail, and then thou canst drag it into thy cave, and devour it in peace.”"
"This advice pleased the lion: he lay down, and in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, he kept quite quiet. But the fox tied the lion’s legs together with the horse’s tail, and twisted and fastened all so well and so strongly that no strength could break it."
"When he had finished his work, he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, “Pull, white horse, pull.” Then up sprang the horse at once, and drew the lion away with him. The lion began to roar so that all the birds in the forest flew out in terror, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and dragged him over the country to his master’s door. When the master saw the lion, he was of a better mind, and said to the horse, “Thou shalt stay with me and fare well,” and he gave him plenty to eat until he died."
133 The Shoes That Were Danced to Pieces
"There was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other. They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the King locked the door, and bolted it. But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass. Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be King after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life. It was not long before a King’s son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses’ sleeping-chamber."
"His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open."
"But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles. On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives. Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. “I hardly know myself,”"
"answered he, and added in jest, “I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.”"
"“That is not so difficult,” said the old woman, “you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.” With that she gave him a little cloak, and said, “If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.” When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him. He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop. Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep. The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said, “He, too, might as well have saved his life.” With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said, “I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.” “Thou art a goose, who art always frightened,” said the eldest. “Hast thou forgotten how many Kings’ sons have already come here in vain? I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.” When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure. The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first. The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out, “What is that? who is pulling my dress?” “Don’t be so silly!” said the eldest, “you have caught it on a nail.” Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought, “I must carry a token away with me,” and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report. The youngest cried out again."
"“Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?” But the eldest said, “It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.” After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes. They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest. Then her prince said, “I can’t tell why the boat is so much heavier to-day; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.” “What should cause that,” said the youngest, “but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.”"
"On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums."
"They rowed over there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth; the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always made her be silent. They danced there till three o’clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off; the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night. When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said, “So far as he is concerned, we are safe.” They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and again went with them. Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say. When the King put the question, “Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?” he answered, “In an underground castle with twelve princes,”"
"and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens. The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all."
"Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife? He answered, “I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.” Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the King’s death. But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve."
134 The Six Servants
"In former times there lived an aged Queen who was a sorceress, and her daughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. The old woman, however, had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction, and when a wooer appeared, she said that whosoever wished to have her daughter, must first perform a task, or die. Many had been dazzled by the daughter’s beauty, and had actually risked this, but they never could accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do, and then no mercy was shown; they had to kneel down, and their heads were struck off. A certain King’s son who had also heard of the maiden’s beauty, said to his father, “Let me go there, I want to demand her in marriage.” “Never,” answered the King; “if you were to go, it would be going to your death.” On this the son lay down and was sick unto death, and for seven years he lay there, and no physician could heal him. When the father perceived that all hope was over, with a heavy heart he said to him, “Go thither, and try your luck, for I know no other means of curing you.” When the son heard that, he rose from his bed and was well again, and joyfully set out on his way."
"And it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath, he saw from afar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground, and when he drew nearer, he could see that it was the stomach of a man, who had laid himself down there, but the stomach looked like a small mountain."
"When the fat man saw the traveller, he stood up and said, “If you are in need of any one, take me into your service.” The prince answered, “What can I do with such a great big man?” “Oh,” said the Stout One, “this is nothing, when I stretch myself out well, I am three thousand times fatter.” “If that’s the case,” said the prince, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” So the Stout One followed the prince, and after a while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear laid to the turf. “What art thou doing there?” asked the King’s son. “I am listening,” replied the man. “What art thou listening to so attentively?” “I am listening to what is just going on in the world, for nothing escapes my ears; I even hear the grass growing.” “Tell me,”"
"said the prince, “what thou hearest at the court of the old Queen who has the beautiful daughter.” Then he answered, “I hear the whizzing of the sword that is striking off a wooer’s head.” The King’s son said, “I can make use of thee, come with me.” They went onwards, and then saw a pair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs, but could not see the rest of the body. When they had walked on for a great distance, they came to the body, and at last to the head also. “Why,” said the prince, “what a tall rascal thou art!” “Oh,” replied the Tall One, “that is nothing at all yet; when I really stretch out my limbs, I am three thousand times as tall, and taller than the highest mountain on earth."
"I will gladly enter your service, if you will take me.” “Come with me,”"
"said the prince, “I can make use of thee.” They went onwards and found a man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes. The prince said to him, “Hast thou weak eyes, that thou canst not look at the light?”"
"“If others have tried it,” said Brother Lustig, “I will try it too.”"
"“Leave it alone,” said the host, “it will cost you your neck.” “It won’t kill me at once,” said Brother Lustig, “just give me the key, and some good food and wine.” So the host gave him the key, and food and wine, and with this Brother Lustig went into the castle, enjoyed his supper, and at length, as he was sleepy, he lay down on the ground, for there was no bed. He soon fell asleep, but during the night was disturbed by a great noise, and when he awoke, he saw nine ugly devils in the room, who had made a circle, and were dancing around him."
"Brother Lustig said, “Well, dance as long as you like, but none of you must come too close.” But the devils pressed continually nearer to him, and almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet. “Stop, you devils’ ghosts,” said he, but they behaved still worse. Then Brother Lustig grew angry, and cried, “Hola! but I will soon make it quiet,”"
"and got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with it. But nine devils against one soldier were still too many, and when he struck those in front of him, the others seized him behind by the hair, and tore it unmercifully. “Devils’ crew,” cried he, “it is getting too bad, but wait. Into my knapsack, all nine of you!” In an instant they were in it, and then he buckled it up and threw it into a corner. After this all was suddenly quiet, and Brother Lustig lay down again, and slept till it was bright day. Then came the inn-keeper, and the nobleman to whom the castle belonged, to see how he had fared; but when they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished, and asked, “Have the spirits done you no harm, then?” “The reason why they have not,” answered Brother Lustig, “is because I have got the whole nine of them in my knapsack! You may once more inhabit your castle quite tranquilly, none of them will ever haunt it again.” The nobleman thanked him, made him rich presents, and begged him to remain in his service, and he would provide for him as long as he lived. “No,”"
"replied Brother Lustig, “I am used to wandering about, I will travel farther.” Then he went away, and entered into a smithy, laid the knapsack, which contained the nine devils on the anvil, and asked the smith and his apprentices to strike it. So they smote with their great hammers with all their strength, and the devils uttered howls which were quite pitiable. When he opened the knapsack after this, eight of them were dead, but one which had been lying in a fold of it, was still alive, slipped out, and went back again to hell. Thereupon Brother Lustig travelled a long time about the world, and those who know them can tell many a story about him, but at last he grew old, and thought of his end, so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man, and said to him, “I am tired of wandering about, and want now to behave in such a manner that I shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.” The hermit replied, “There are two roads, one is broad and pleasant, and leads to hell, the other is narrow and rough, and leads to heaven.” “I should be a fool,” thought Brother Lustig, “if I were to take the narrow, rough road.” So he set out and took the broad and pleasant road, and at length came to a great black door, which was the door of Hell. Brother Lustig knocked, and the door-keeper peeped out to see who was there. But when he saw Brother Lustig, he was terrified, for he was the very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack, and had escaped from it with a black eye. So he pushed the bolt in again as quickly as he could, ran to the devil’s lieutenant, and said, “There is a fellow outside with a knapsack, who wants to come in, but as you value your lives don’t allow him to enter, or he will wish the whole of hell into his knapsack. He once gave me a frightful hammering when I was inside it.” So they called out to Brother Lustig that he was to go away again, for he should not get in there! “If they won’t have me here,” thought he, “I will see if I can find a place for myself in heaven, for I must be somewhere.” So he turned about and went onwards until he came to the door of Heaven, where he knocked. St. Peter was sitting hard by as door-keeper. Brother Lustig recognised him at once, and thought, “Here I find an old friend, I shall get on better.” But St. Peter said, “I really believe that thou wantest to come into Heaven.” “Let me in, brother; I must get in somewhere; if they would have taken me into Hell, I should not have come here.” “No,” said St."
"Peter, “thou shalt not enter.” “Then if thou wilt not let me in, take thy knapsack back, for I will have nothing at all from thee.” “Give it here, then,” said St. Peter. Then Brother Lustig gave him the knapsack into Heaven through the bars, and St. Peter took it, and hung it beside his seat. Then said Brother Lustig, “And now I wish myself inside my knapsack,” and in a second he was in it, and in Heaven, and St. Peter was forced to let him stay there."
82 Gambling Hansel
"Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but Gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had. Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. Then Gambling Hansel said, “For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.” So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection. Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker’s and fetch some bread. So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, “Hansel, do come in.” “Oh,” said he, “do you want to win the three groschen too?” On this they would not let him go. So he went in, and played away the three groschen also. Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play. St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf. Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, “Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!” But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there. For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, “Well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there.” When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out! So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there. Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favours. The Lord expected that he would ask to go to Heaven; but Gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so. The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter."
"And now Gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world. Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world. We must send Death to him.” When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, “Hansel, come out a while.” But Gambling Hansel said, “Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.” Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died."
"So St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on. People no longer die; we must go ourselves.” And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down. So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, “Come down,” and Death took him directly and put an end to him. They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, we will have nothing to do with him! Begone!” So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more. “Who is there?” “Gambling Hansel.” “Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him. We do not want to gamble, just go away again.” Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in. There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world."
And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again.
"Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do. And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack. So again St. Peter said, “Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.” And they let him in. But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. Therefore St. Peter once more said, “Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.” So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day."
83 Hans in Luck
"Hans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, “Master, my time is up; now I should be glad to go back home to my mother; give me my wages.” The master answered, “You have served me faithfully and honestly; as the service was so shall the reward be;” and he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home."
"As he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. “Ah!” said Hans quite loud, “what a fine thing it is to ride! There you sit as on a chair; you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and get on, you don’t know how.”"
"The rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, “Hollo! Hans, why do you go on foot, then?”"
"“I must,” answered he, “for I have this lump to carry home; it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.”"
"“I will tell you what,” said the rider, “we will exchange: I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump.”"
"“With all my heart,” said Hans, “but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.”"
"The rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up; then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, “If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"Hans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, “Jup! Jup!”"
"The horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him."
"Hans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again, but he was vexed, and said to the countryman, “It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one’s neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one’s milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.”"
"“Well,” said the countryman, “if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.” Hans agreed with the greatest delight; the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away."
"Hans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. “If only I have a morsel of bread—and that can hardly fail me—I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like; if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. Good heart, what more can I want?”"
"When he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great content ate up what he had with him—his dinner and supper—and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother’s village."
"As it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst. “I can find a cure for this,” thought Hans; “I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.” He tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath; but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was."
"By good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig. “What sort of a trick is this?”"
"cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened."
"The butcher gave him his flask and said, “Take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast; at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.” “Well, well,” said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, “who would have thought it? Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home; what meat one has! But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different; and then there are the sausages!”"
"“Hark ye, Hans,” said the butcher, “out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.” “Heaven repay you for your kindness!” said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand."
"Hans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished; if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast. “Just lift her,” added he, and laid hold of her by the wings; “how heavy she is—she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.” “Yes,” said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, “she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.”"
"When the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, “Henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears; men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.” The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent birds which would otherwise have to starve."
"The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request. So the ears were left as they now grow."
195 The Grave-Mound
"A rich farmer was one day standing in his yard inspecting his fields and gardens. The corn was growing up vigorously and the fruit-trees were heavily laden with fruit. The grain of the year before still lay in such immense heaps on the floors that the rafters could hardly bear it. Then he went into the stable, where were well-fed oxen, fat cows, and horses bright as looking-glass. At length he went back into his sitting-room, and cast a glance at the iron chest in which his money lay."
"Whilst he was thus standing surveying his riches, all at once there was a loud knock close by him. The knock was not at the door of his room, but at the door of his heart. It opened, and he heard a voice which said to him, “Hast thou done good to thy family with it? Hast thou considered the necessities of the poor? Hast thou shared thy bread with the hungry? Hast thou been contented with what thou hast, or didst thou always desire to have more?” The heart was not slow in answering, “I have been hard and pitiless, and have never shown any kindness to my own family. If a beggar came, I turned away my eyes from him. I have not troubled myself about God, but have thought only of increasing my wealth. If everything which the sky covers had been mine own, I should still not have had enough.”"
"When he was aware of this answer he was greatly alarmed, his knees began to tremble, and he was forced to sit down."
"Then there was another knock, but the knock was at the door of his room. It was his neighbour, a poor man who had a number of children whom he could no longer satisfy with food. “I know,” thought the poor man, “that my neighbour is rich, but he is as hard as he is rich. I don’t believe he will help me, but my children are crying for bread, so I will venture it.” He said to the rich man, “You do not readily give away anything that is yours, but I stand here like one who feels the water rising above his head. My children are starving, lend me four measures* of corn.” The rich man looked at him long, and then the first sunbeam of mercy began to melt away a drop of the ice of greediness. “I will not lend thee four measures,” he answered, “but I will make thee a present of eight, but thou must fulfil one condition.” “What am I to do?” said the poor man. “When I am dead, thou shalt watch for three nights by my grave.” The peasant was disturbed in his mind at this request, but in the need in which he was, he would have consented to anything; he accepted, therefore, and carried the corn home with him."
"It seemed as if the rich man had foreseen what was about to happen, for when three days were gone by, he suddenly dropped down dead. No one knew exactly how it came to pass, but no one grieved for him. When he was buried, the poor man remembered his promise; he would willingly have been released from it, but he thought, “After all, he acted kindly by me. I have fed my hungry children with his corn, and even if that were not the case, where I have once given my promise I must keep it.”"
"At nightfall he went into the churchyard, and seated himself on the grave-mound. Everything was quiet, only the moon appeared above the grave, and frequently an owl flew past and uttered her melancholy cry."
"When the sun rose, the poor man betook himself in safety to his home, and in the same manner the second night passed quietly by. On the evening of the third day he felt a strange uneasiness, it seemed to him that something was about to happen. When he went out he saw, by the churchyard-wall, a man whom he had never seen before. He was no longer young, had scars on his face, and his eyes looked sharply and eagerly around. He was entirely covered with an old cloak, and nothing was visible but his great riding-boots. “What are you looking for here?”"
the peasant asked. “Are you not afraid of the lonely churchyard?”
"“I am looking for nothing,” he answered, “and I am afraid of nothing! I am like the youngster who went forth to learn how to shiver, and had his labour for his pains, but got the King’s daughter to wife and great wealth with her, only I have remained poor. I am nothing but a paid-off soldier, and I mean to pass the night here, because I have no other shelter.” “If you are without fear,” said the peasant, “stay with me, and help me to watch that grave there.”"
"“To keep watch is a soldier’s business,” he replied, “whatever we fall in with here, whether it be good or bad, we will share it between us.”"
"The peasant agreed to this, and they seated themselves on the grave together."
"All was quiet until midnight, when suddenly a shrill whistling was heard in the air, and the two watchers perceived the Evil One standing bodily before them. “Be off, you ragamuffins!” cried he to them, “the man who lies in that grave belongs to me; I want to take him, and if you don’t go away I will wring your necks!” “Sir with the red feather,”"
"said the soldier, “you are not my captain, I have no need to obey you, and I have not yet learned how to fear. Go away, we shall stay sitting here.”"
"The Devil thought to himself, “Money is the best thing with which to get hold of these two vagabonds.” So he began to play a softer tune, and asked quite kindly, if they would not accept a bag of money, and go home with it? “That is worth listening to,” answered the soldier, “but one bag of gold won’t serve us, if you will give as much as will go into one of my boots, we will quit the field for you and go away.”"
"“I have not so much as that about me,” said the Devil, “but I will fetch it. In the neighbouring town lives a money-changer who is a good friend of mine, and will readily advance it to me.” When the Devil had vanished the soldier took his left boot off, and said, “We will soon pull the charcoal-burner’s nose for him, just give me your knife, comrade.” He cut the sole off the boot, and put it in the high grass near the grave on the edge of a hole that was half over-grown. “That will do,” said he; “now the chimney-sweep may come.”"
"They both sat down and waited, and it was not long before the Devil returned with a small bag of gold in his hand. “Just pour it in,” said the soldier, raising up the boot a little, “but that won’t be enough.”"
"The Black One shook out all that was in the bag; the gold fell through, and the boot remained empty. “Stupid Devil,” cried the soldier, “it won’t do! Didn’t I say so at once? Go back again, and bring more.” The Devil shook his head, went, and in an hour’s time came with a much larger bag under his arm. “Now pour it in,” cried the soldier, “but I doubt the boot won’t be full.” The gold clinked as it fell, but the boot remained empty. The Devil looked in himself with his burning eyes, and convinced himself of the truth. “You have shamefully big calves to your legs!” cried he, and made a wry face. “Did you think,” replied the soldier, “that I had a cloven foot like you? Since when have you been so stingy? See that you get more gold together, or our bargain will come to nothing!” The Wicked One went off again. This time he stayed away longer, and when at length he appeared he was panting under the weight of a sack which lay on his shoulders. He emptied it into the boot, which was just as far from being filled as before. He became furious, and was just going to tear the boot out of the soldier’s hands, but at that moment the first ray of the rising sun broke forth from the sky, and the Evil Spirit fled away with loud shrieks. The poor soul was saved."
"The peasant wished to divide the gold, but the soldier said, “Give what falls to my lot to the poor, I will come with thee to thy cottage, and together we will live in rest and peace on what remains, as long as God is pleased to permit.”"
196 Old Rinkrank
"There was once on a time a King who had a daughter, and he caused a glass mountain to be made, and said that whosoever could cross to the other side of it without falling should have his daughter to wife. Then there was one who loved the King’s daughter, and he asked the King if he might have her. “Yes,” said the King; “if you can cross the mountain without falling, you shall have her.” And the princess said she would go over it with him, and would hold him if he were about to fall. So they set out together to go over it, and when they were half way up the princess slipped and fell, and the glass-mountain opened and shut her up inside it, and her betrothed could not see where she had gone, for the mountain closed immediately. Then he wept and lamented much, and the King was miserable too, and had the mountain broken open where she had been lost, and though the would be able to get her out again, but they could not find the place into which she had fallen. Meanwhile the King’s daughter had fallen quite deep down into the earth into a great cave. An old fellow with a very long gray beard came to meet her, and told her that if she would be his servant and do everything he bade her, she might live, if not he would kill her. So she did all he bade her. In the mornings he took his ladder out of his pocket, and set it up against the mountain and climbed to the top by its help, and then he drew up the ladder after him. The princess had to cook his dinner, make his bed, and do all his work, and when he came home again he always brought with him a heap of gold and silver. When she had lived with him for many years, and had grown quite old, he called her Mother Mansrot, and she had to call him Old Rinkrank. Then once when he was out, and she had made his bed and washed his dishes, she shut the doors and windows all fast, and there was one little window through which the light shone in, and this she left open. When Old Rinkrank came home, he knocked at his door, and cried, “Mother Mansrot, open the door for me.”"
"“No,” said she, “Old Rinkrank, I will not open the door for thee.” Then he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Wash my dishes, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have washed thy dishes already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Make me my bed, Mother Mansrot.”"
"“I have made thy bed already,” said she. Then again he said,"
"“Here stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot, Open the door, Mother Mansrot.”"
"Then he ran all round his house, and saw that the little window was open, and thought, “I will look in and see what she can be about, and why she will not open the door for me.” He tried to peep in, but could not get his head through because of his long beard. So he first put his beard through the open window, but just as he had got it through, Mother Mansrot came by and pulled the window down with a cord which she had tied to it, and his beard was shut fast in it. Then he began to cry most piteously, for it hurt him very much, and to entreat her to release him again. But she said not until he gave her the ladder with which he ascended the mountain. Then, whether he would or not, he had to tell her where the ladder was. And she fastened a very long ribbon to the window, and then she set up the ladder, and ascended the mountain, and when she was at the top of it she opened the window. She went to her father, and told him all that had happened to her. The King rejoiced greatly, and her betrothed was still there, and they went and dug up the mountain, and found Old Rinkrank inside it with all his gold and silver. Then the King had Old Rinkrank put to death, and took all his gold and silver. The princess married her betrothed, and lived right happily in great magnificence and joy."
197 The Crystal Ball
"There was once an enchantress, who had three sons who loved each other as brothers, but the old woman did not trust them, and thought they wanted to steal her power from her. So she changed the eldest into an eagle, which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains, and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky. The second, she changed into a whale, which lived in the deep sea, and all that was seen of it was that it sometimes spouted up a great jet of water in the air. Each of them only bore his human form for only two hours daily. The third son, who was afraid she might change him into a raging wild beast a bear perhaps, or a wolf, went secretly away. He had heard that a King’s daughter who was bewitched, was imprisoned in the Castle of the Golden Sun, and was waiting for deliverance. Those, however, who tried to free her risked their lives; three-and-twenty youths had already died a miserable death, and now only one other might make the attempt, after which no more must come. And as his heart was without fear, he caught at the idea of seeking out the Castle of the Golden Sun. He had already travelled about for a long time without being able to find it, when he came by chance into a great forest, and did not know the way out of it."
"“Nothing is wanting, not even a hair, Be sure the Devil himself is there.”"
"Then it was Jergli’s turn to speak,"
"“If it be not, it’s at least his mother, Or else it’s the Devil’s own step-brother.”"
"And now Marli had a bright thought, and said to Veitli,"
"“Advance, Veitli, advance, advance, And I behind will hold the lance.”"
"Veitli, however, did not attend to that, and Jackli said,"
"“Tis Schulz’s place the first to be, No one deserves that honor but he.”"
"Then Master Schulz plucked up his courage, and said, gravely,"
"“Then let us boldly advance to the fight, And thus we shall show our valour and might.”"
"Hereupon they all together set on the dragon. Master Schulz crossed himself and prayed for God’s assistance, but as all this was of no avail, and he was getting nearer and nearer to the enemy, he screamed “Oho! oho! ho! ho! ho!” in the greatest anguish. This awakened the hare, which in great alarm darted swiftly away. When Master Schulz saw her thus flying from the field of battle, he cried in his joy."
"“Quick, Veitli, quick, look there, look there, The monster’s nothing but a hare!”"
"But the Swabian allies went in search of further adventures, and came to the Moselle, a mossy, quiet, deep river, over which there are few bridges, and which in many places people have to cross in boats. As the seven Swabians did not know this, they called to a man who was working on the opposite side of the river, to know how people contrived to get across. The distance and their way of speaking made the man unable to understand what they wanted, and he said “What? what?” in the way people speak in the neighborhood of Treves. Master Schulz thought he was saying, “Wade, wade through the water,” and as he was the first, began to set out and went into the moselle. It was not long before he sank in the mud and the deep waves which drove against him, but his hat was blown on the opposite shore by the wind, and a frog sat down beside it, and croaked “Wat, wat, wat.” The other six on the opposite side heard that, and said, “Oho, comrades, Master Schulz is calling us; if he can wade across, why cannot we?” So they all jumped into the water together in a great hurry, and were drowned, and thus one frog took the lives of all six of them, and not one of the Swabian allies ever reached home again."
120 The Three Apprentices
"There were once three apprentices, who had agreed to keep always together while travelling, and always to work in the same town. At one time, however, their masters had no more work to give them, so that at last they were in rags, and had nothing to live on. Then one of them said, “What shall we do? We cannot stay here any longer, we will travel once more, and if we do not find any work in the town we go to, we will arrange with the innkeeper there, that we are to write and tell him where we are staying, so that we can always have news of each other, and then we will separate.” And that seemed best to the others also."
"They went forth, and met on the way a richly-dressed man who asked who they were. “We are apprentices looking for work; Up to this time we have kept together, but if we cannot find anything to do we are going to separate.” “There is no need for that,” said the man, “if you will do what I tell you, you shall not want for gold or for work; nay, you shall become great lords, and drive in your carriages!” One of them said, “If our souls and salvation be not endangered, we will certainly do it.” “They will not,” replied the man, “I have no claim on you.” One of the others had, however, looked at his feet, and when he saw a horse’s foot and a man’s foot, he did not want to have anything to do with him. The Devil, however, said, “Be easy, I have no designs on you, but on another soul, which is half my own already, and whose measure shall but run full.” As they were now secure, they consented, and the Devil told them what he wanted. The first was to answer, “All three of us,” to every question; the second was to say, “For money,” and the third, “And quite right too!” They were always to say this, one after the other, but they were not to say one word more, and if they disobeyed this order, all their money would disappear at once, but so long as they observed it, their pockets would always be full. As a beginning, he at once gave them as much as they could carry, and told them to go to such and such an inn when they got to the town. They went to it, and the innkeeper came to meet them, and asked if they wished for anything to eat? The first replied, “All three of us.” “Yes,” said the host, “that is what I mean.” The second said, “For money.” “Of course,” said the host. The third said, “And quite right too!”"
"“Certainly it is right,” said the host."
"Good meat and drink were now brought to them, and they were well waited on. After the dinner came the payment, and the innkeeper gave the bill to the one who said, “All three of us,” the second said, “For money,”"
"and the third, “and quite right too!” “Indeed it is right,” said the host, “all three pay, and without money I can give nothing.” They, however, paid still more than he had asked. The lodgers, who were looking on, said, “These people must be mad.” “Yes, indeed they are,”"
"said the host, “they are not very wise.” So they stayed some time in the inn, and said nothing else but, “All three of us,” “For money,” and “And quite right too!” But they saw and knew all that was going on. It so happened that a great merchant came with a large sum of money, and said, “Sir host, take care of my money for me, here are three crazy apprentices who might steal it from me.” The host did as he was asked."
"As he was carrying the trunk into his room, he felt that it was heavy with gold. Thereupon he gave the three apprentices a lodging below, but the merchant came up-stairs into a separate apartment. When it was midnight, and the host thought that all were asleep, he came with his wife, and they had an axe and struck the rich merchant dead; and after they had murdered him they went to bed again. When it was day there was a great outcry; the merchant lay dead in bed bathed in blood. All the guests ran at once but the host said, “The three crazy apprentices have done this;” the lodgers confirmed it, and said, “It can have been no one else.” The innkeeper, however, had them called, and said to them, “Have you killed the merchant?” “All three of us,” said the first, “For money,” said the second; and the third added, “And quite right too!”"
"“There now, you hear,” said the host, “they confess it themselves.”"
"They were taken to prison, therefore, and were to be tried. When they saw that things were going so seriously, they were after all afraid, but at night the Devil came and said, “Bear it just one day longer, and do not play away your luck, not one hair of your head shall be hurt.”"
"The next morning they were led to the bar, and the judge said, “Are you the murderers?” “All three of us.” “Why did you kill the merchant?”"
"“For money.” “You wicked wretches, you have no horror of your sins?”"
"“And quite right too!” “They have confessed, and are still stubborn,”"
"said the judge, “lead them to death instantly.” So they were taken out, and the host had to go with them into the circle. When they were taken hold of by the executioner’s men, and were just going to be led up to the scaffold where the headsman was standing with naked sword, a coach drawn by four blood-red chestnut horses came up suddenly, driving so fast that fire flashed from the stones, and someone made signs from the window with a white handkerchief. Then said the headsman, “It is a pardon coming,” and “Pardon! pardon!” was called from the carriage also. Then the Devil stepped out as a very noble gentleman, beautifully dressed, and said, “You three are innocent; you may now speak, make known what you have seen and heard.” Then said the eldest, “We did not kill the merchant, the murderer is standing there in the circle,” and he pointed to the innkeeper. “In proof of this, go into his cellar, where many others whom he has killed are still hanging.” Then the judge sent the executioner’s men thither, and they found it was as the apprentices said, and when they had informed the judge of this, he caused the innkeeper to be led up, and his head was cut off. Then said the Devil to the three, “Now I have got the soul which I wanted to have, and you are free, and have money for the rest of your lives.”"
121 The King’s Son Who Feared Nothing
"There was once a King’s son, who was no longer content to stay at home in his father’s house, and as he had no fear of anything, he thought, “I will go forth into the wide world, there the time will not seem long to me, and I shall see wonders enough.” So he took leave of his parents, and went forth, and on and on from morning till night, and whichever way his path led it was the same to him. It came to pass that he got to the house of a giant, and as he was so tired he sat down by the door and rested. And as he let his eyes roam here and there, he saw the giant’s playthings lying in the yard. These were a couple of enormous balls, and nine-pins as tall as a man. After a while he had a fancy to set the nine-pins up and then rolled the balls at them, and screamed and cried out when the nine-pins fell, and had a merry time of it. The giant heard the noise, stretched his head out of the window, and saw a man who was not taller than other men, and yet played with his nine-pins. “Little worm,” cried he, “why art thou playing with my balls? Who gave thee strength to do it?” The King’s son looked up, saw the giant, and said, “Oh, thou blockhead, thou thinkest indeed that thou only hast strong arms, I can do everything I want to do.” The giant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration, and said, “Child of man, if thou art one of that kind, go and bring me an apple of the tree of life.” “What dost thou want with it?” said the King’s son. “I do not want the apple for myself,” answered the giant, “but I have a betrothed bride who wishes for it. I have travelled far about the world and cannot find the tree.” “I will soon find it,” said the King’s son, “and I do not know what is to prevent me from getting the apple down.” The giant said, “Thou really believest it to be so easy! The garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron railing, and in front of the railing lie wild beasts, each close to the other, and they keep watch and let no man go in.” “They will be sure to let me in,” said the King’s son. “Yes, but even if thou dost get into the garden, and seest the apple hanging to the tree, it is still not thine; a ring hangs in front of it, through which any one who wants to reach the apple and break it off, must put his hand, and no one has yet had the luck to do it.” “That luck will be mine,” said the King’s son."
"Then he took leave of the giant, and went forth over mountain and valley, and through plains and forests, until at length he came to the wondrous garden."
"The beasts lay round about it, but they had put their heads down and were asleep. Moreover, they did not awake when he went up to them, so he stepped over them, climbed the fence, and got safely into the garden. There, in the very middle of it, stood the tree of life, and the red apples were shining upon the branches. He climbed up the trunk to the top, and as he was about to reach out for an apple, he saw a ring hanging before it; but he thrust his hand through that without any difficulty, and gathered the apple. The ring closed tightly on his arm, and all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his veins. When he had come down again from the tree with the apple, he would not climb over the fence, but grasped the great gate, and had no need to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud crash. Then he went out, and the lion which had been lying down before, was awake and sprang after him, not in rage and fierceness, but following him humbly as its master."
"The King’s son took the giant the apple he had promised him, and said, “Seest thou, I have brought it without difficulty.” The giant was glad that his desire had been so soon satisfied, hastened to his bride, and gave her the apple for which she had wished. She was a beautiful and wise maiden, and as she did not see the ring on his arm, she said, “I shall never believe that thou hast brought the apple, until I see the ring on thine arm.” The giant said, “I have nothing to do but go home and fetch it,” and thought it would be easy to take away by force from the weak man, what he would not give of his own free will. He therefore demanded the ring from him, but the King’s son refused it. “Where the apple is, the ring must be also,” said the giant; “if thou wilt not give it of thine own accord, thou must fight with me for it.”"
"They wrestled with each other for a long time, but the giant could not get the better of the King’s son, who was strengthened by the magical power of the ring. Then the giant thought of a stratagem, and said, “I have got warm with fighting, and so hast thou. We will bathe in the river, and cool ourselves before we begin again.” The King’s son, who knew nothing of falsehood, went with him to the water, and pulled off with his clothes the ring also from his arm, and sprang into the river."
"Now when it was noon the King said, “One of you girls must take him something to eat.” “No,” said the two eldest, “We will not take it to him; the one by whom he last watched, can take him something.” Then the youngest was forced to go and take him something to eat. When she got into the forest, she asked him how he was getting on? “Oh,” said he, “I am getting on very badly.” Then she said he was to come and just eat a little. “Nay,” said he, “I cannot do that, I shall still have to die, so I will eat no more.” Then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him just to try, that he came and ate something. When he had eaten something she said, “I will comb thy hair a while, and then thou wilt feel happier.”"
"So she combed his hair, and he became weary and fell asleep, and then she took her handkerchief and made a knot in it, and struck it three times on the earth, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.” In a moment, numbers of little earth-men came forth, and asked what the King’s daughter commanded? Then said she, “In three hours’ time the great forest must be cut down, and the whole of the wood laid in heaps.” So the little earth-men went about and got together the whole of their kindred to help them with the work. They began at once, and when the three hours were over, all was done, and they came back to the King’s daughter and told her so. Then she took her white handkerchief again and said, “Earth-workers, go home.” On this they all disappeared. When the King’s son awoke, he was delighted, and she said, “Come home when it has struck six o’clock.” He did as she told him, and then the King asked, “Hast thou made away with the forest?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. When they were sitting at table, the King said, “I cannot yet give thee my daughter to wife, thou must still do something more for her sake.” So he asked what it was to be, then? “I have a great fish-pond,”"
"said the King. “Thou must go to it to-morrow morning and clear it of all mud until it is as bright as a mirror, and fill it with every kind of fish.” The next morning the King gave him a glass shovel and said, “The fish-pond must be done by six o’clock.” So he went away, and when he came to the fish-pond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in two, then he stuck his hoe in the mud, and broke it also. Then he was much troubled. At noon the youngest daughter brought him something to eat, and asked him how he was getting on? So the King’s son said everything was going very ill with him, and he would certainly have to lose his head. “My tools have broken to pieces again.” “Oh,” said she, “thou must just come and eat something, and then thou wilt be in another frame of mind.” “No,” said he, “I cannot eat, I am far too unhappy for that!” Then she gave him many good words until at last he came and ate something. Then she combed his hair again, and he fell asleep, so once more she took her handkerchief, tied a knot in it, and struck the ground thrice with the knot, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth.” In a moment a great many little earth-men came and asked what she desired, and she told them that in three hours’ time, they must have the fish-pond entirely cleaned out, and it must be so clear that people could see themselves reflected in it, and every kind of fish must be in it. The little earth-men went away and summoned all their kindred to help them, and in two hours it was done. Then they returned to her and said, “We have done as thou hast commanded.” The King’s daughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the ground with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home again.” Then they all went away."
"When the King’s son awoke the fish-pond was done. Then the King’s daughter went away also, and told him that when it was six he was to come to the house. When he arrived at the house the King asked, “Hast thou got the fish-pond done?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. That was very good."
"When they were again sitting at table the King said, “Thou hast certainly done the fish-pond, but I cannot give thee my daughter yet; thou must just do one thing more.” “What is that, then?” asked the King’s son. The King said he had a great mountain on which there was nothing but briars which must all be cut down, and at the top of it the youth must build up a great castle, which must be as strong as could be conceived, and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle must be inside it. And when he arose next morning the King gave him a glass axe and a glass gimlet with him, and he was to have all done by six o’clock. As he was cutting down the first briar with the axe, it broke off short, and so small that the pieces flew all round about, and he could not use the gimlet either. Then he was quite miserable, and waited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his need. When it was mid-day she came and brought him something to eat. He went to meet her and told her all, and ate something, and let her comb his hair and fell asleep. Then she once more took the knot and struck the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, come forth!” Then came once again numbers of earth-men, and asked what her desire was. Then said she, “In the space of three hours they must cut down the whole of the briars, and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that must be as strong as any one could conceive, and all the furniture that pertains to a castle must be inside it.” They went away, and summoned their kindred to help them and when the time was come, all was ready."
"Then they came to the King’s daughter and told her so, and the King’s daughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with it, and said, “Earth-workers, go home,” on which they all disappeared. When therefore the King’s son awoke and saw everything done, he was as happy as a bird in air."
"When it had struck six, they went home together. Then said the King, “Is the castle ready?” “Yes,” said the King’s son. When they sat down to table, the King said, “I cannot give away my youngest daughter until the two eldest are married.” Then the King’s son and the King’s daughter were quite troubled, and the King’s son had no idea what to do. But he went by night to the King’s daughter and ran away with her."
"When they had got a little distance away, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her father behind her. “Oh,” said she, “what are we to do? My father is behind us, and will take us back with him. I will at once change thee into a briar, and myself into a rose, and I will shelter myself in the midst of the bush.” When the father reached the place, there stood a briar with one rose on it, then he was about to gather the rose, when the thorn came and pricked his finger so that he was forced to go home again. His wife asked why he had not brought their daughter back with him? So he said he had nearly got up to her, but that all at once he had lost sight of her, and a briar with one rose was growing on the spot."
"Then said the Queen, “If thou hadst but gathered the rose, the briar would have been forced to come too.” So he went back again to fetch the rose, but in the meantime the two were already far over the plain, and the King ran after them. Then the daughter once more looked round and saw her father coming, and said, “Oh, what shall we do now? I will instantly change thee into a church and myself into a priest, and I will stand up in the pulpit, and preach.” When the King got to the place, there stood a church, and in the pulpit was a priest preaching."
"So he listened to the sermon, and then went home again."
"Then the Queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him, and he said, “Nay, I ran a long time after her, and just as I thought I should soon overtake her, a church was standing there and a priest was in the pulpit preaching.” “Thou shouldst just have brought the priest,”"
"said his wife, “and then the church would soon have come. It is no use to send thee, I must go there myself.” When she had walked for some time, and could see the two in the distance, the King’s daughter peeped round and saw her mother coming, and said, “Now we are undone, for my mother is coming herself: I will immediately change thee into a fish-pond and myself into a fish."
"When the mother came to the place, there was a large fish-pond, and in the midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water, and it was quite merry. She wanted to catch the fish, but she could not. Then she was very angry, and drank up the whole pond in order to catch the fish, but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit, and vomited the whole pond out again. Then she cried, “I see very well that nothing can be done now,” and said that now they might come back to her. Then the King’s daughter went back again, and the Queen gave her daughter three walnuts, and said, “With these thou canst help thyself when thou art in thy greatest need.” So the young folks went once more away together. And when they had walked quite ten miles, they arrived at the castle from whence the King’s son came, and close by it was a village. When they reached it, the King’s son said, “Stay here, my dearest, I will just go to the castle, and then will I come with a carriage and with attendants to fetch thee.”"
"When he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the King’s son back again, and he told them he had a bride who was now in the village, and they must go with the carriage to fetch her. Then they harnessed the horses at once, and many attendants seated themselves outside the carriage. When the King’s son was about to get in, his mother gave him a kiss, and he forgot everything which had happened, and also what he was about to do. On this his mother ordered the horses to be taken out of the carriage again, and everyone went back into the house. But the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched, and thought he would come and fetch her, but no one came. Then the King’s daughter took service in the mill which belonged to the castle, and was obliged to sit by the pond every afternoon and clean the tubs."
"And the Queen came one day on foot from the castle, and went walking by the pond, and saw the well-grown maiden sitting there, and said, “What a fine strong girl that is! She pleases me well!” Then she and all with her looked at the maid, but no one knew her. So a long time passed by during which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully. In the meantime, the Queen had sought a wife for her son, who came from quite a distant part of the world. When the bride came, they were at once to be married. And many people hurried together, all of whom wanted to see everything. Then the girl said to the miller that he might be so good as to give her leave to go also. So the miller said, “Yes, do go there.” When she was about to go, she opened one of the three walnuts, and a beautiful dress lay inside it. She put it on, and went into the church and stood by the altar. Suddenly came the bride and bridegroom, and seated themselves before the altar, and when the priest was just going to bless them, the bride peeped half round and saw the maiden standing there. Then she stood up again, and said she would not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that lady there. So they went back to the house again, and sent to ask the lady if she would sell that dress. No, she would not sell it, but the bride might perhaps earn it. Then the bride asked her how she was to do this? Then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the King’s son’s door, the bride might have what she wanted. So the bride said, “Yes, she was willing to do that.” But the servants were ordered to give the King’s son a sleeping-drink, and then the maiden laid herself down on the threshold and lamented all night long. She had had the forest cut down for him, she had had the fish-pond cleaned out for him, she had had the castle built for him, she had changed him into a briar, and then into a church, and at last into a fish-pond, and yet he had forgotten her so quickly. The King’s son did not hear one word of it, but the servants had been awakened, and had listened to it, and had not known what it could mean. The next morning when they were all up, the bride put on the dress, and went away to the church with the bridegroom. In the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut, and a still more beautiful dress was inside it. She put it on, and went and stood by the altar in the church, and everything happened as it had happened the time before. And the maiden again lay all night on the threshold which led to the chamber of the King’s son, and the servant was once more to give him a sleeping-drink. The servant, however, went to him and gave him something to keep him awake, and then the King’s son went to bed, and the miller’s maiden bemoaned herself as before on the threshold of the door, and told of all that she had done. All this the King’s son heard, and was sore troubled, and what was past came back to him. Then he wanted to go to her, but his mother had locked the door. The next morning, however, he went at once to his beloved, and told her everything which had happened to him, and prayed her not to be angry with him for having forgotten her. Then the King’s daughter opened the third walnut, and within it was a still more magnificent dress, which she put on, and went with her bridegroom to church, and numbers of children came who gave them flowers, and offered them gay ribbons to bind about their feet, and they were blessed by the priest, and had a merry wedding. But the false mother and the bride had to depart. And the mouth of the person who last told all this is still warm."
114 The Cunning Little Tailor
"There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud. If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not find it out, he was sent contemptuously away. She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might. At length, therefore, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous bits of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also; the third was a little useless land-louper, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from? Then the two others said to him, “Just stay at home; thou canst not do much with thy little bit of understanding.”"
"The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and said he had set his head to work about this for once, and he would manage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his."
"They all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was to propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now come, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a needle. Then said the princess, “I have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it?” “If that be all,” said the first, “it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt.” The princess said, “Wrongly guessed; let the second answer.” Then said the second, “If it be not black and white, then it is brown and red, like my father’s company coat.” “Wrongly guessed,” said the princess, “let the third give the answer, for I see very well he knows it for certain.” Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, “The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors.” When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down with terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she had firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it. When her courage returned she said, “Thou hast not won me yet by that; there is still something else that thou must do. Below, in the stable is a bear with which thou shalt pass the night, and when I get up in the morning if thou art still alive, thou shalt marry me.” She expected, however, she should thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left any one alive who had fallen into his clutches. The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, “Boldly ventured is half won.”"
"When therefore the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the bear. The bear was about to set at the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws: “Softly, softly,” said the little tailor, “I will soon make thee quiet.” Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels. When the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too. The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles. The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would. “Eh!” thought he, “what a stupid blockhead I am! I cannot even crack a nut!” and then he said to the tailor, “Here, crack me the nuts.” “There, see what a stupid fellow thou art!” said the little tailor, “to have such a great mouth, and not be able to crack a small nut!” Then he took the pebble and nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it was in two! “I must try the thing again,” said the bear; “when I watch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too.” So the tailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body. But no one will imagine that he accomplished it."
"When that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his coat, and played a piece of it to himself. When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, “Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?” “Light enough for a child. Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the right I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hop sa sa vivallalera!” “So,” said the bear; “fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy. What dost thou think of that? Wilt thou give me lessons?” “With all my heart,” said the tailor, “if thou hast a talent for it. But just let me see thy claws, they are terribly long, I must cut thy nails a little.” Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, “Now wait until I come with the scissors,” and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep."
"When the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the night, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy, and had made an end of the tailor. In the morning she arose careless and happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood gaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water. Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married. When they had got into the carriage, the two other tailors, who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again. The bear in great fury ran after the carriage. The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, “Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!” The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs out of the window, and cried, “Dost thou see the vise? If thou dost not be off thou shalt be put into it again.” When the bear saw that, he turned round and ran away. The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark. Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a thaler."
115 The Bright Sun Brings It to Light
"A tailor’s apprentice was travelling about the world in search of work, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so great that he had not a farthing to live on. Presently he met a Jew on the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money about him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew, and said, “Give me thy money, or I will strike thee dead.” Then said the Jew, “Grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings.” But the tailor said, “Money thou hast; and it shall be produced,” and used violence and beat him until he was near death. And when the Jew was dying, the last words he said were, “The bright sun will bring it to light,” and thereupon he died. The tailor’s apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight farthings, as the Jew had said. Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work. After he had traveled about a long while, he got work in a town with a master who had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married her, and lived in good and happy wedlock."
"After a long time when he and his wife had two children, the wife’s father and mother died, and the young people kept house alone. One morning, when the husband was sitting on the table before the window, his wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it out into the saucer, and was just going to drink, the sun shone on it and the reflection gleamed hither and thither on the wall above, and made circles on it. Then the tailor looked up and said, “Yes, it would like very much to bring it to light, and cannot!” The woman said, “Oh, dear husband, and what is that, then?” “What dost thou mean by that?” He answered, “I must not tell thee.” But she said, “If thou lovest me, thou must tell me,” and used her most affectionate words, and said that no one should ever know it, and left him no rest. Then he told her how years ago, when he was travelling about seeking work and quite worn out and penniless, he had killed a Jew, and that in the last agonies of death, the Jew had spoken the words, “The bright sun will bring it to light.” And now, the sun had just wanted to bring it to light, and had gleamed and made circles on the wall, but had not been able to do it."
"After this, he again charged her particularly never to tell this, or he would lose his life, and she did promise. When however, he had sat down to work again, she went to her great friend and confided the story to her, but she was never to repeat it to any human being, but before two days were over, the whole town knew it, and the tailor was brought to trial, and condemned. And thus, after all, the bright sun did bring it to light."
116 The Blue Light
"There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the King faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The King said to him, “Thou mayst return to thy home, I need thee no longer, and thou wilt not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.” Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. “Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,” said he to her, “or I shall starve.” “Oho!” she answered, “who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.” “What do you wish?” said the soldier. “That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.” The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. “I see well enough,” said the witch, “that you can do no more to-day, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must to-morrow chop me a load of wood, and make it small.” The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more."
"“To-morrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.” Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. “No,” said he, perceiving her evil intention, “I will not give thee the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.” The witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and went away."
"The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. “This shall be my last pleasure,”"
"thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke."
"When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said, “Lord, what are thy commands?” “What commands have I to give thee?” replied the soldier, quite astonished."
179 The Goose-Girl at the Well
"There was once upon a time a very old woman, who lived with her flock of geese in a waste place among the mountains, and there had a little house. The waste was surrounded by a large forest, and every morning the old woman took her crutch and hobbled into it. There, however, the dame was quite active, more so than any one would have thought, considering her age, and collected grass for her geese, picked all the wild fruit she could reach, and carried everything home on her back."
"Any one would have thought that the heavy load would have weighed her to the ground, but she always brought it safely home. If any one met her, she greeted him quite courteously. “Good day, dear countryman, it is a fine day. Ah! you wonder that I should drag grass about, but every one must take his burthen on his back.” Nevertheless, people did not like to meet her if they could help it, and took by preference a round-about way, and when a father with his boys passed her, he whispered to them, “Beware of the old woman. She has claws beneath her gloves; she is a witch.” One morning, a handsome young man was going through the forest. The sun shone bright, the birds sang, a cool breeze crept through the leaves, and he was full of joy and gladness. He had as yet met no one, when he suddenly perceived the old witch kneeling on the ground cutting grass with a sickle. She had already thrust a whole load into her cloth, and near it stood two baskets, which were filled with wild apples and pears. “But, good little mother,” said he, “how canst thou carry all that away?” “I must carry it, dear sir,” answered she, “rich folk’s children have no need to do such things, but with the peasant folk the saying goes, don’t look behind you, you will only see how crooked your back is!”"
"“Will you help me?” she said, as he remained standing by her. “You have still a straight back and young legs, it would be a trifle to you."
"Besides, my house is not so very far from here, it stands there on the heath behind the hill. How soon you would bound up thither.” The young man took compassion on the old woman. “My father is certainly no peasant,” replied he, “but a rich count; nevertheless, that you may see that it is not only peasants who can carry things, I will take your bundle.” “If you will try it,” said she, “I shall be very glad. You will certainly have to walk for an hour, but what will that signify to you; only you must carry the apples and pears as well?” It now seemed to the young man just a little serious, when he heard of an hour’s walk, but the old woman would not let him off, packed the bundle on his back, and hung the two baskets on his arm. “See, it is quite light,”"
"said she. “No, it is not light,” answered the count, and pulled a rueful face. “Verily, the bundle weighs as heavily as if it were full of cobble stones, and the apples and pears are as heavy as lead! I can scarcely breathe.” He had a mind to put everything down again, but the old woman would not allow it. “Just look,” said she mockingly, “the young gentleman will not carry what I, an old woman, have so often dragged along. You are ready with fine words, but when it comes to be earnest, you want to take to your heels. Why are you standing loitering there?” she continued. “Step out. No one will take the bundle off again.” As long as he walked on level ground, it was still bearable, but when they came to the hill and had to climb, and the stones rolled down under his feet as if they were alive, it was beyond his strength."
"The drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and ran, hot and cold, down his back. “Dame,” said he, “I can go no farther. I want to rest a little.” “Not here,” answered the old woman, “when we have arrived at our journey’s end, you can rest; but now you must go forward. Who knows what good it may do you?” “Old woman, thou art becoming shameless!”"
"said the count, and tried to throw off the bundle, but he laboured in vain; it stuck as fast to his back as if it grew there. He turned and twisted, but he could not get rid of it. The old woman laughed at this, and sprang about quite delighted on her crutch. “Don’t get angry, dear sir,” said she, “you are growing as red in the face as a turkey-cock!"
Carry your bundle patiently. I will give you a good present when we get home.”
"What could he do? He was obliged to submit to his fate, and crawl along patiently behind the old woman. She seemed to grow more and more nimble, and his burden still heavier. All at once she made a spring, jumped on to the bundle and seated herself on the top of it; and however withered she might be, she was yet heavier than the stoutest country lass. The youth’s knees trembled, but when he did not go on, the old woman hit him about the legs with a switch and with stinging-nettles. Groaning continually, he climbed the mountain, and at length reached the old woman’s house, when he was just about to drop."
"When the geese perceived the old woman, they flapped their wings, stretched out their necks, ran to meet her, cackling all the while."
"Behind the flock walked, stick in hand, an old wench, strong and big, but ugly as night. “Good mother,” said she to the old woman, “has anything happened to you, you have stayed away so long?” “By no means, my dear daughter,” answered she, “I have met with nothing bad, but, on the contrary, with this kind gentleman, who has carried my burthen for me; only think, he even took me on his back when I was tired. The way, too, has not seemed long to us; we have been merry, and have been cracking jokes with each other all the time.” At last the old woman slid down, took the bundle off the young man’s back, and the baskets from his arm, looked at him quite kindly, and said, “Now seat yourself on the bench before the door, and rest. You have fairly earned your wages, and they shall not be wanting.” Then she said to the goose-girl, “Go into the house, my dear daughter, it is not becoming for thee to be alone with a young gentleman; one must not pour oil on to the fire, he might fall in love with thee.” The count knew not whether to laugh or to cry. “Such a sweetheart as that,” thought he, “could not touch my heart, even if she were thirty years younger.” In the meantime the old woman stroked and fondled her geese as if they were children, and then went into the house with her daughter. The youth lay down on the bench, under a wild apple-tree. The air was warm and mild; on all sides stretched a green meadow, which was set with cowslips, wild thyme, and a thousand other flowers; through the midst of it rippled a clear brook on which the sun sparkled, and the white geese went walking backwards and forwards, or paddled in the water. “It is quite delightful here,”"
"said he, “but I am so tired that I cannot keep my eyes open; I will sleep a little. If only a gust of wind does not come and blow my legs off my body, for they are as rotten as tinder.”"
"When he had slept a little while, the old woman came and shook him till he awoke. “Sit up,” said she, “thou canst not stay here; I have certainly treated thee hardly, still it has not cost thee thy life. Of money and land thou hast no need, here is something else for thee.”"
"Thereupon she thrust a little book into his hand, which was cut out of a single emerald. “Take great care of it,” said she, “it will bring thee good fortune.” The count sprang up, and as he felt that he was quite fresh, and had recovered his vigor, he thanked the old woman for her present, and set off without even once looking back at the beautiful daughter. When he was already some way off, he still heard in the distance the noisy cry of the geese."
"For three days the count had to wander in the wilderness before he could find his way out. He then reached a large town, and as no one knew him, he was led into the royal palace, where the King and Queen were sitting on their throne. The count fell on one knee, drew the emerald book out of his pocket, and laid it at the Queen’s feet. She bade him rise and hand her the little book. Hardly, however, had she opened it, and looked therein, than she fell as if dead to the ground."
"The count was seized by the King’s servants, and was being led to prison, when the Queen opened her eyes, and ordered them to release him, and every one was to go out, as she wished to speak with him in private."
"When the Queen was alone, she began to weep bitterly, and said, “Of what use to me are the splendours and honours with which I am surrounded; every morning I awake in pain and sorrow. I had three daughters, the youngest of whom was so beautiful that the whole world looked on her as a wonder. She was as white as snow, as rosy as apple-blossom, and her hair as radiant as sun-beams. When she cried, not tears fell from her eyes, but pearls and jewels only. When she was fifteen years old, the King summoned all three sisters to come before his throne. You should have seen how all the people gazed when the youngest entered, it was just as if the sun were rising! Then the King spoke, “My daughters, I know not when my last day may arrive; I will to-day decide what each shall receive at my death. You all love me, but the one of you who loves me best, shall fare the best.” Each of them said she loved him best. “Can you not express to me,” said the King, “how much you do love me, and thus I shall see what you mean?” The eldest spoke. “I love my father as dearly as the sweetest sugar.” The second, “I love my father as dearly as my prettiest dress.” But the youngest was silent. Then the father said, “And thou, my dearest child, how much dost thou love me?” “I do not know, and can compare my love with nothing.” But her father insisted that she should name something."
"So she said at last, “The best food does not please me without salt, therefore I love my father like salt.” When the King heard that, he fell into a passion, and said, “If thou lovest me like salt, thy love shall also be repaid thee with salt.” Then he divided the kingdom between the two elder, but caused a sack of salt to be bound on the back of the youngest, and two servants had to lead her forth into the wild forest. We all begged and prayed for her, said the Queen, “but the King’s anger was not to be appeased. How she cried when she had to leave us! The whole road was strewn with the pearls which flowed from her eyes. The King soon afterwards repented of his great severity, and had the whole forest searched for the poor child, but no one could find her. When I think that the wild beasts have devoured her, I know not how to contain myself for sorrow; many a time I console myself with the hope that she is still alive, and may have hidden herself in a cave, or has found shelter with compassionate people. But picture to yourself, when I opened your little emerald book, a pearl lay therein, of exactly the same kind as those which used to fall from my daughter’s eyes; and then you can also imagine how the sight of it stirred my heart. You must tell me how you came by that pearl.” The count told her that he had received it from the old woman in the forest, who had appeared very strange to him, and must be a witch, but he had neither seen nor hear anything of the Queen’s child. The King and the Queen resolved to seek out the old woman. They thought that there where the pearl had been, they would obtain news of their daughter."
"The old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinning-wheel, spinning. It was already dusk, and a log which was burning on the hearth gave a scanty light. All at once there was a noise outside, the geese were coming home from the pasture, and uttering their hoarse cries. Soon afterwards the daughter also entered. But the old woman scarcely thanked her, and only shook her head a little. The daughter sat down beside her, took her spinning-wheel, and twisted the threads as nimbly as a young girl. Thus they both sat for two hours, and exchanged never a word. At last something rustled at the window, and two fiery eyes peered in. It was an old night-owl, which cried, “Uhu!”"
"three times. The old woman looked up just a little, then she said, “Now, my little daughter, it is time for thee to go out and do thy work.” She rose and went out, and where did she go? Over the meadows ever onward into the valley. At last she came to a well, with three old oak-trees standing beside it; meanwhile the moon had risen large and round over the mountain, and it was so light that one could have found a needle. She removed a skin which covered her face, then bent down to the well, and began to wash herself. When she had finished, she dipped the skin also in the water, and then laid it on the meadow, so that it should bleach in the moonlight, and dry again. But how the maiden was changed! Such a change as that was never seen before! When the gray mask fell off, her golden hair broke forth like sunbeams, and spread about like a mantle over her whole form. Her eyes shone out as brightly as the stars in heaven, and her cheeks bloomed a soft red like apple-blossom."
"But the fair maiden was sad. She sat down and wept bitterly. One tear after another forced itself out of her eyes, and rolled through her long hair to the ground. There she sat, and would have remained sitting a long time, if there had not been a rustling and cracking in the boughs of the neighbouring tree. She sprang up like a roe which has been overtaken by the shot of the hunter. Just then the moon was obscured by a dark cloud, and in an instant the maiden had put on the old skin and vanished, like a light blown out by the wind."
"She ran back home, trembling like an aspen-leaf. The old woman was standing on the threshold, and the girl was about to relate what had befallen her, but the old woman laughed kindly, and said, “I already know all.” She led her into the room and lighted a new log. She did not, however, sit down to her spinning again, but fetched a broom and began to sweep and scour, “All must be clean and sweet,” she said to the girl. “But, mother,” said the maiden, “why do you begin work at so late an hour? What do you expect?” “Dost thou know then what time it is?” asked the old woman. “Not yet midnight,” answered the maiden, “but already past eleven o’clock.” “Dost thou not remember,” continued the old woman, “that it is three years to-day since thou camest to me? Thy time is up, we can no longer remain together.” The girl was terrified, and said, “Alas! dear mother, will you cast me off? Where shall I go? I have no friends, and no home to which I can go. I have always done as you bade me, and you have always been satisfied with me; do not send me away.” The old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her. “My stay here is over,” she said to her, “but when I depart, house and parlour must be clean: therefore do not hinder me in my work. Have no care for thyself, thou shalt find a roof to shelter thee, and the wages which I will give thee shall also content thee.” “But tell me what is about to happen,” the maiden continued to entreat. “I tell thee again, do not hinder me in my work. Do not say a word more, go to thy chamber, take the skin off thy face, and put on the silken gown which thou hadst on when thou camest to me, and then wait in thy chamber until I call thee.”"
"But I must once more tell of the King and Queen, who had journeyed forth with the count in order to seek out the old woman in the wilderness. The count had strayed away from them in the wood by night, and had to walk onwards alone. Next day it seemed to him that he was on the right track. He still went forward, until darkness came on, then he climbed a tree, intending to pass the night there, for he feared that he might lose his way. When the moon illumined the surrounding country he perceived a figure coming down the mountain. She had no stick in her hand, but yet he could see that it was the goose-girl, whom he had seen before in the house of the old woman. “Oho,” cried he, “there she comes, and if I once get hold of one of the witches, the other shall not escape me!” But how astonished he was, when she went to the well, took off the skin and washed herself, when her golden hair fell down all about her, and she was more beautiful than any one whom he had ever seen in the whole world. He hardly dared to breathe, but stretched his head as far forward through the leaves as he dared, and stared at her."
"Either he bent over too far, or whatever the cause might be, the bough suddenly cracked, and that very moment the maiden slipped into the skin, sprang away like a roe, and as the moon was suddenly covered, disappeared from his eyes. Hardly had she disappeared, before the count descended from the tree, and hastened after her with nimble steps. He had not been gone long before he saw, in the twilight, two figures coming over the meadow. It was the King and Queen, who had perceived from a distance the light shining in the old woman’s little house, and were going to it. The count told them what wonderful things he had seen by the well, and they did not doubt that it had been their lost daughter. They walked onwards full of joy, and soon came to the little house. The geese were sitting all round it, and had thrust their heads under their wings and were sleeping, and not one of them moved. The King and Queen looked in at the window, the old woman was sitting there quite quietly spinning, nodding her head and never looking round. The room was perfectly clean, as if the little mist men, who carry no dust on their feet, lived there. Their daughter, however, they did not see."
"They gazed at all this for a long time, at last they took heart, and knocked softly at the window. The old woman appeared to have been expecting them; she rose, and called out quite kindly, “Come in,—I know you already.” When they had entered the room, the old woman said, “You might have spared yourself the long walk, if you had not three years ago unjustly driven away your child, who is so good and lovable. No harm has come to her; for three years she has had to tend the geese; with them she has learnt no evil, but has preserved her purity of heart. You, however, have been sufficiently punished by the misery in which you have lived.” Then she went to the chamber and called, “Come out, my little daughter.” Thereupon the door opened, and the princess stepped out in her silken garments, with her golden hair and her shining eyes, and it was as if an angel from heaven had entered."
"She went up to her father and mother, fell on their necks and kissed them; there was no help for it, they all had to weep for joy. The young count stood near them, and when she perceived him she became as red in the face as a moss-rose, she herself did not know why. The King said, “My dear child, I have given away my kingdom, what shall I give thee?”"
"“She needs nothing,” said the old woman. “I give her the tears that she has wept on your account; they are precious pearls, finer than those that are found in the sea, and worth more than your whole kingdom, and I give her my little house as payment for her services.” When the old woman had said that, she disappeared from their sight. The walls rattled a little, and when the King and Queen looked round, the little house had changed into a splendid palace, a royal table had been spread, and the servants were running hither and thither."
"The story goes still further, but my grandmother, who related it to me, had partly lost her memory, and had forgotten the rest. I shall always believe that the beautiful princess married the count, and that they remained together in the palace, and lived there in all happiness so long as God willed it. Whether the snow-white geese, which were kept near the little hut, were verily young maidens (no one need take offence,) whom the old woman had taken under her protection, and whether they now received their human form again, and stayed as handmaids to the young Queen, I do not exactly know, but I suspect it."
"This much is certain, that the old woman was no witch, as people thought, but a wise woman, who meant well. Very likely it was she who, at the princess’s birth, gave her the gift of weeping pearls instead of tears. That does not happen now-a-days, or else the poor would soon become rich."
180 Eve’s Various Children
"When Adam and Eve were driven out of Paradise, they were compelled to build a house for themselves on unfruitful ground, and eat their bread in the sweat of their brow. Adam dug up the land, and Eve span. Every year Eve brought a child into the world; but the children were unlike each other, some pretty, and some ugly. After a considerable time had gone by, God sent an angel to them, to announce that he was coming to inspect their household. Eve, delighted that the Lord should be so gracious, cleaned her house diligently, decked it with flowers, and strewed reeds on the floor. Then she brought in her children, but only the beautiful ones. She washed and bathed them, combed their hair, put clean raiment on them, and cautioned them to conduct themselves decorously and modestly in the presence of the Lord. They were to bow down before him civilly, hold out their hands, and to answer his questions modestly and sensibly. The ugly children were, however, not to let themselves be seen. One hid himself beneath the hay, another under the roof, a third in the straw, the fourth in the stove, the fifth in the cellar, the sixth under a tub, the seventh beneath the wine-cask, the eighth under an old fur cloak, the ninth and tenth beneath the cloth out of which she always made their clothes, and the eleventh and twelfth under the leather out of which she cut their shoes. She had scarcely got ready, before there was a knock at the house-door. Adam looked through a chink, and saw that it was the Lord."

"of a foreign compound name has been used alone, as _Merle d'Aubigné_"
(index under _Merle_ with a cross-reference from _Aubigné_).
"In French, a forename is sometimes joined to a surname by a hyphen. In"
"such cases make the entry under the family name, with a cross-reference"
"from the forename: e.g., entry, _Rochette, Désiré Raoul_;"
"cross-reference, _Raoul-Rochette, Désiré_. See _Rochette_."
"(_c_) In foreign compound names of women also, although the first part"
"is usually the maiden name and the second the husband's name, the entry"
"should generally be under the first, with a cross-reference from the"
"second[51]: e.g., _Rivé-King_, with cross-reference from _King, born"
Rivé_.
Index surnames preceded by prefixes:
"(_a_) In French and Belgian, under the prefix when it is or contains"
"an article, _Le, La, L', Du, Des_; under the word following when the"
"prefix is a preposition, _de, d'_: e.g., _Des Essarts, Du Cange,"

"(_b_) In English, under the prefix, no matter from what language the"
"name is derived, with cross-references when necessary: e.g., _De"
"Quincey_, _Van Buren_."
Index under the highest title:
"British and foreign noblemen, with cross-reference from earlier titles"
"by which they have been known, and, in the case of British noblemen,"
"from the family name: e.g., _Chesterfield, 4th Earl of (Philip"
"Dormer Stanhope)_. _Chesterfield, 5th Earl of (Philip Stanhope)_."
"Cross-reference from _Stanhope_. _Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroi, Duc"
de_.
Authors should be put under their names. The definition of a name is
"""that by which a person or thing is known."" Noblemen are known by their"
"titles, not by their family names."
In the few cases in which the family name[50] or a lower title is
"decidedly better known, index under that and cross-reference from"
"the title: e.g., _Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam_; _Robert Curzon,"
"14th Baron Zouche_; _John Napier, Baron of Merchiston_; _Horace"
"Walpole, 4th Earl of Oxford_; likewise the military nobles and"
"princes of the French Empire: e.g., _Lucien Bonaparte, Prince de"
"Canino_; _McMahon, Duc de Magenta_."
Englishwomen's titles-of-honor are to be treated by the following
rules. In the matter of titles an Englishwoman in marrying has
everything to gain and nothing to lose. If she marries above her
"own rank she takes her husband's title in exchange for her own,"
if below her own rank she keeps her own title.
(_a_) The wife of a peer takes her husband's style.
"That is, she is Baroness, Viscountess, Marchioness, etc. In indexing,"
"say _Brassey, Annie (Allnutt), Baroness_; not _Brassey, Annie"
"(Allnutt), Lady_."

The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"
Sam Doolittle start for the backside with his pike pole and that meant
"a blow for Sam didn't waste steps. ""'Tisn't likely Letty Vine'll _go_"
"to Truro tonight."""
"""But I'll _see_ if she's going, anyway,"" Sidney had cried and had raced"
"off, a sweater over her arm."
"""I wish I could tell her how very important it is and then she'd"
"understand, but I can't for maybe she wouldn't understand,"" Sidney"
thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"“What very stupid and false ideas,” exclaimed Laura. “Really I"
appreciate having a brother who talks in such a vulgar way.”
“You are an aristocrat and the truth doesn’t please you. But such are
the facts. I can see the chief of the bureau of Papal titles. What fun
he must have thinking up the most appropriate title for a magnate of
Yankee tinned beef or for an illustrious Andean general! How magnificent
it would be to gather all the Bishops _in partibus infidelium_ and all
the people with Papal titles in one drawing-room! The Bishop of Nicaea
discussing with the Marquis of the Holy Roman Empire; the Marchioness of
"Easter Sunday flirting with the Bishop of Sion, while the Patriarchs"
"of Thebes, Damascus, and Trebizond played bridge with the sausage"
"manufacturer, Mr. Smiles, the pork king, or with the illustrious General"
"Pérez, the hero of Guachinanguito. What a moving spectacle it would be!”"
“You are a clown!” said Laura.
"“He is a finished satirist,” added Kennedy."
_CÆSAR’S PLAN_
"After lunch, Laura, Kennedy, and Cæsar went into the salon, and Laura"
introduced the Englishman to the San Martino girls and the Countess
"Brenda. They stayed there chatting until four o’clock, at which time the"
"San Martinos got ready to go out in a motor car, and Laura, with the"
"Countess and her daughter, in a carriage."
Cæsar and Kennedy went into the street together.
"“You are awfully well fixed here,” said Kennedy, “with no Americans, no"
The duke regarded his host out of half-shut watery eyes.
"""My own choice is Chianti!"""
"""A difference of five years in purgatory!"""
Thereupon the duke blew the froth of his wine in the Abbot's face.
"""Purgatory!--A mere figure of speech!"""
The Abbot emptied his tankard.
"""The figures of speech are the pillars of the Church!"""
He beckoned to the custodian.
"""Poculum alterum imple!"""
The lean friar came and disappeared noiselessly.
They drank for a time in heavy silence. After a time the Abbot
"sneezed, which caused Beelzebub, the Abbot's black he-goat, who had"
"been browsing outside, to peer through the crescent-shaped aperture in"
the casement and regard him quizzically.
"The duke, who chanced to look up at that precise moment, saw the red"
"inflamed eyes of the Abbot's tutelar genius, and, mistaking the goat"
"for another presence, turned to his host."
"""Do you not fear,"" he whispered, ""lest Satan may pay you a visit"
"during some of your uncanonical pastimes?"""
to Test Pilot Fayburn. A space egg had smashed through the cockpit
Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"
a madman. What had brought about the change? Was he still human or was
he now OUT OF THIS WORLD?
Only time would tell as he daringly laid siege to an important air base
and began using his frightening power to force men and women to serve
his evil purpose.

Each one was the exact replica of the other--from the tips of his

"The young lady refolded the letter, and handed it to the boy."
"“De gent wants an answer,” said the messenger. “Wot’s de word?”"
"The lady’s eyes suddenly flashed on him, bright, smiling and wet."
"“Tell that guy on the other bench,” she said, with a happy, tremulous"
"laugh, “that his girl wants him.”"
THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

tricks were the outcome of years of concentrated effort and constant
"exercise, and being moved by the Grace of God, he desired to offer the"
best thing he had to give to the Lord of Life. His best was his skill.
"He lived by it. Shown in the streets and the play places, it won for"
him his daily bread. His work was to give men amusement in their hours
of recreation by an exhibition of his feats of strength and
"nimbleness. Could this, his one talent, be consecrated and devoted to"
"God? So he considered, and humbly sought the sanctuary, and there"
before the Presence he performed his fantastic tricks which had cost
him years of endeavour. The story is a parable which men have not been
"slow to read, and it has become the theme of the musician and artist."

Every three months with unfailing regularity small paragraphs appear
in the daily papers headed “RECORD LOW BIRTH-RATE.” Some figures
find the tiger alternating with the monkey. There the dominant note on
"the walls is the patriotic note, insults to politicians, calling them"
"assassins and thieves, and also sentiments of revenge expressed by"
"an _‘A mort Dupin!’_ or _‘A mort Duval!’_ Moreover, there is a great"
enthusiasm for the guillotine.”
“And Madrid?”
"“Madrid is at heart a rude, moral town with little imagination, and"
the epigraphs on the walls and benches are primitive.”
“And in Rome what do you find?”
"“Here one finds a mixture of pornography, romanticism, and politics."
"A heart pierced by an arrow and poetic phrases, alternate with some"
enormous piece of filthiness and with hurrahs for Anarchy or for the
_‘Papa-re.’_”
“Well done!” said Kennedy; “I can see that the branch of epigraphy you
practise amounts to something. It should be systematized and given a
name.”
“What do you think we should name it? Wallography?”
“Very good.”
“And one of these fine days we can systematize it. Now we might go and

"They took a tram which was coming back from St. Paul’s beyond the Walls,"
and returned to the heart of the city.
Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “I call it letting ourselves down. They don’t even know how
to put on their clothes like Christians.”
"He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling."
"“Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,” he"
growled....
He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
"doorway, ushering in four guests."
"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."

"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
"RAYNER, CAPTAIN."
"In a letter to the Lords of Trade, dated from Philadelphia, February 28th,"
"1701, William Penn mentions that several of Captain Kidd's men had settled"
as planters in Carolina with Rayner as their captain.
"RAYNOR, WILLIAM."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.
"READ, CAPTAIN."
Commanded a brigantine which had its headquarters at Madagascar. Rescued
the pirate Thomas White. Read died at sea.
"READ, MARY. Woman pirate."
Born in London of obscure parentage; all that is known for certain is that
"her mother was a ""young and airy widow."" Mary was brought up as a boy, and"
at the age of 13 was engaged as a footboy to wait on a French lady. Having
"a roving spirit, Mary ran away and entered herself on board a man-of-war."
"Deserting a few years later, she enlisted in a regiment of foot and fought"
"in Flanders, showing on all occasions great bravery, but quitted the"
service to enlist in a regiment of horse. Her particular comrade in this
"regiment was a Fleming, with whom she fell in love and disclosed to him"
"the secret of her sex. She now dressed as a woman, and the two troopers"
"were married, ""which made a great noise,"" and several of her officers"
attended the nuptials. She and her husband got their discharge and kept an
"eating house or ordinary, the Three Horseshoes, near the Castle of Breda."
“Yes; that’s true. She is too much of a prize beauty.”
“That is the defect in the Yankee women; they have no character. The
"weight of tradition might be fatal to industry and modern life, but it"
is the one thing that creates the spirituality of the old countries.
"Beyond contradiction American women have intelligence, beauty, energy,"
"attractive flashes, but they lack that particular thing created by"
centuries: character. At times they have very charming impulses. Have
you heard the story about Prince Torlonia’s wife?”
“No.”
"“Well, Torlonia’s present wife was an American girl worth millions, who"
"came with letters to the prince. He took her about Rome, and at the end"
"of some days he said to her, supposing that the beautiful American had"
the intention of marrying: ‘I will introduce some young noblemen to
you’; and she answered: ‘Don’t introduce anybody to me; because you
please me more than anybody’; and she married him.”
“It was a pretty impulse.”
"“Yes, Americans do things like that on the spur of the moment. But if"
"you saw a Spanish woman behave that way, it would seem wrong to you.”"
Chattering amicably they came to the Piazza Esedra.
“Would you care to have lunch with me?” said Kennedy.
“Just what I was going to propose to you.”
“I eat alone.”
"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
"Four--whom would that come from?"""
"The burly man frowned. ""That would be the physics boys, Opperly's"
"group. Is anything wrong?"""
Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust
"controls, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually"
"he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting."
"From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the"
six officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to
get used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.
*       *       *       *       *
"Jorj turned, smiling. ""And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie"
"In the preparation of copy, consistency of spelling and punctuation is"
"strongly urged, as it not only simplifies the problem for the printer,"
but also prevents possible misunderstanding of copy and consequent
necessity for resetting.
All paragraphs should be clearly indicated in the copy.
"All directions written upon the manuscript, which are not intended as"
"""copy,"" should be enclosed in a circle."
"The author should punctuate each sentence as he writes it, for in this"
"way the marks are indicative of the natural pauses, and better express"
his meaning.
Foot-notes should always be clearly indicated.
"""Ay! But enough to make a garden,"" I returned, as we climbed the narrow"
flight of steps leading to the private entrance to the Old Swan.
"When we paused at the door, Frances said, ""Your garden is at hand."" And"
"when she opened the door, there stood Betty, and I was in Eden. The moist"
"glow of her eyes, the faint blush of her cheeks, the nervous fluttering"
"of her voice, spoke more eloquently than all the tongues of Babel could"
"have spoken, and I could not help comparing her welcome with that which"
Maxy Hamilton had given me at the queen's ball.
"Bettina led us to the parlor, and while we were drinking a cup of tea,"
we had the great pleasure of asking and answering questions of which we
always had a large supply in reserve.
"When it was time to go, Bettina walked down to the Bridge with us. As it"
"was growing dark, Frances suggested that I walk back to the Old Swan with"
"Betty, which I did, she taking my arm of her own accord, and both of us"
"very happy, though we spoke not a word, for fear of saying too much, save"
"""good night"" at the door."
"""Good night at the door!"" God gave its sweetness to youth right out of"
the core of His infinite love.
CHAPTER XII
A PERILOUS EMBASSY
"Four or five days after our visit to Bettina, I met De Grammont at"
he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front
"of the car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw"
the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind
"a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away."
"Descended to the ground, James Williams faced his captors with a smile."
He was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in Cloverdale
about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach
"lingered, out of respect for its patrons. What could be a more"
interesting sight than this?
"“My name is James Williams, of Cloverdale, Missouri,” he said kindly,"
so that they would not be too greatly mortified. “I have letters here
that will show—”
"“You’ll come with us, please,” announced the plainclothes man. “‘Pinky’"
McGuire’s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds. A
detective saw you on the Rubberneck up at Central Park and ’phoned down
to take you in. Do your explaining at the station-house.”
James Williams’s wife—his bride of two weeks—looked him in the face
"with a strange, soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks,"
looked him in the face and said:
"“Go with ’em quietly, ‘Pinky,’ and maybe it’ll be in your favour.”"
And then as the Glaring-at-Gotham car rolled away she turned and threw
a kiss—his wife threw a kiss—at some one high up on the seats of the
Rubberneck.
"“Your girl gives you good advice, McGuire,” said Donovan. “Come on,"
now.”
"asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it"
"outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And"
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the _huldres_
"disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the"
"wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,"
"and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
NOTE
A favorite jewel among the treasures of the underground world
"plays the leading part of the tale: ""The Hat of the _Huldres_"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 157; from the vicinity of"
"Eidsvold, told by an old peasant woman). Often appearing in"
"legend proper as the tarn-cap, it here finds a more humble place"
"in everyday life, neither ennobled by legendary dignity, nor"
diversified by the rich incident of fairy-tale. The entertaining
picture here afforded of its powers shows them all the more
clearly.
X
THE CHILD OF MARY
"Far, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple."
Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so
poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her
"""A man named Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf."""
The next instant I saw that the mention of that name affected the mother
no less markedly than it had affected the daughter.  Her face blanched;
"her eyes opened wide in fear, and her glance became in a moment"
"suspicious.  With marvellous self-possession she, however, pretended"
ignorance.
"""Wolf?"" she repeated.  ""I do not remember the name.  Possibly he is some"
"person we have met while travelling."""
"""Yolande knew him, I believe, in Brussels,"" I remarked.  ""He appeared to"
"be acquainted with you."""
"""My daughter's friends are not always mine,"" she remarked coldly, with"
"that cleverness which only a woman of the world can possess, and at once"
returned to the discussion of Yolande and the probability of her
recovery.
This puzzled me.  I felt somehow convinced that she knew the truth.  She
"had some distinct object in endeavouring to seal my lips.  What it was,"
"however, I could not determine."
"She was expressing a fervent hope that her daughter would recover, and"
"pacing the room, impatient to go to her bedside, when, of a sudden, Dick"
"opened the door, and, putting his head inside, addressed me, saying:"
"""Can I speak with you a moment, Ingram?""  She dashed to the door in"
"eagerness, but after a word of introduction from myself, he informed her"
that Yolande had not sufficiently recovered to be disturbed.
"""Perfect quiet is absolutely necessary, madame,"" he urged.  ""Your"
"The end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_"
"(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,"
"pretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the"
"pirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,"
"flinging overboard their black flag ""that it might not rise in Judgement"
"over them."" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look"
"for Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a"
"savoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,"
"but refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut"
"his cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this"
"early hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had"
been sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a
"grape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully"
"dressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to"
"his repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,"
"as he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been ""A"
"short life and a merry one."" One good word can be said for Roberts, that"
he never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.
"ROBERTS, OWEN. Welsh pirate."
"Carpenter in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and killed on November 22nd, 1718,"
off the North Carolina Coast.
"ROBINSON, EDWARD."
Of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
"Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718."
Frances and I felt that we were traitors to our country in helping the
"French king, but we knew that in the end he would buy Dunkirk from our"
"spendthrift monarch, and that out country's loss would be no greater by"
reason of our gain. Therefore I wrote George as follows:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""The Duchess of Hearts is eager and confident. Write at once, giving full"
directions.
"""YOUR FRIEND."""
"Frances added a postscript in cipher, but I shall not translate it."
"One morning, some three weeks after sending my letter, Frances came to me"
"in my closet in the Wardrobe, and I saw at once she was in great trouble."
"Her eyes were red with weeping, and the woebegone expression of her face"
would have been amusing had I not known that some good cause was back of
"it. As soon as she entered I saw that she was going to speak, but closets"
"in Whitehall have ears, so I placed my finger on my lips to enjoin"
"silence, and spoke loud enough to be heard if any one was listening:--"
"""Ah, Frances, I forgot that I had promised to go with you to your"
father's this morning. Wait for me at Holbein's Gate. I'll be there in
"ten minutes."""
"Within the promised time I found Frances at Holbein's Gate, and we walked"
"up to Charing Cross, thence down the Strand toward Temple Bar."
"""What is the trouble, Frances?"" I asked, anxious to hear her news, which"
"I feared was bad. She was in great distress, and I saw that a flood of"
and awful death. Montagu Askew was in the business. He was one of the
few that came out alive.
"In the rush of the distraught ladies, princesses, duchesses, maids, to"
"the sole outlet of the seething hell, Montagu Askew got caught near the"
door--frantic hands of terrified women clutched at him for help--he was
almost within reach of the free air--could see the sunlight a few paces
"before him--a frightened girl clung to his arm in the awful crush, then"
"another--women’s skirts got under foot as they made for the door, and"
"they went down. He tried to shake himself clear of the two girls, he"
was a little slender man.... The heat was hellish.... One of the girls
"tripped on her skirt and fell, clinging to him. He beat her down with"
the jade-handled cane--fought his way blindly through the rush of women
for the door--stood at last out in the sunlight.
"Some coachmen were dashing into the fiery furnace, lifting up and"
"bringing out fainting women, whose muslin skirts were in flames."
But Monty Askew was frightened.
He smoothed his ruffled dress and went home.
"Montagu Askew, entering a café with Rupert Greppel one evening, saluted"
"Noll Baddlesmere, where he stood amongst a group of students; and a"
silence fell upon the place.
Noll nodded:
"“That’s a handsome cane, Askew,” said he--“though they tell me the"
women have a poor opinion of it.”
"“Can't you say, 'Thank you?' “ said the matron."
"“Thank you, sir,” said Unity Blake."
Even in those three words her accent was unmistakably cockney--as
"unmistakably cockney as the coarse-featured, snub-nosed, common little"
"face. In happier, freer conditions she would have done her skimpy hair"
"up in patent curlers and worn a hat with a purple feather, and joined"
heartily in the raucous merriment of her comrades at the pickle-factory.
"Here, however, she was lying, poor little devil, thought Risca, warped"
"from childhood by the ascetic ideal, and wrecked body and spirit by"
unutterable cruelty. In her eyes flickered the patient apprehension of
the ill-treated dog.
"“I hope you will soon get better,” he said, with sickening knowledge of"
that which lay hidden beneath the rough bedclothes.
"“Yes, sir,” said Unity."
"“It 's chiefly her nerves now,” said the matron. “She hollers out of"
"nights, so she can't be put into the dormitory.”"
“Do you like the things I send you?” asked John.
"“Yes, sir.”"
“Is there anything special you'd like to have?”
"“No, sir.”"
But he caught a certain wistfulness in her glance.
"""Going to Havana?"""
"This, too, I admitted."
"""Well, there's a feller by the desk who missed the steamer, and he"
"hoped--er----"""
"""We'd take him over,"" Tommy supplied the halting words. ""Where is he?"""
"Turning, we easily distinguished the man by his timid glances in our"
direction.
"""Whiz-bang,"" Tommy whispered. ""What the deuce would you call it, Jack?"""
"Except for his age, that might have been sixty, he was most comical to"
"look upon--in stature short and round, suggesting kinship with a gnome."
"His head seemed too large for the body, yet this might have been because"
"it carried a plenteous shock of straw-colored hair, with mustache and"
"beard to match. He was attired in ""knickers"" and pleated jacket, that"
"looked as if he'd slept in them, and his fat legs were knock-kneed. On"
the floor about his feet lay almost every conceivable type and age of
"traveling bag, with the inevitable camera."
"""What's his name?"" Tommy asked, not that that would have made any"
difference if his passport were in order.
"""Registered as 'Monsieur Dragot, of Roumania,'"" the proprietor answered."
"""Roumania!"" Tommy looked at me. ""Let's go meet him, Jack."""
"Monsieur Dragot turned out to be the original singed cat, for assuredly"
he possessed more attractive qualities inside than were exteriorly
"George would not have sailed without notifying us."""
"""He may have feared to betray himself by writing,"" she suggested, ""since"
"King Charles had asked King Louis to detain him."""
"""That is true,"" I returned. ""But the occasion must have been urgent"
"indeed if he could not have sent us word in some manner."""
"But I could find no comfort for her, for I really believed that George"
"had gone to Canada, and there was a certain relief to me in knowing that"
he had passed out of Frances's life.
After along silence this feeling of relief found unintentional expression
when I said:--
"""Time heals all wounds, Frances. One of these days you will find a man"
"who will make amends for your present loss, and then--"""
"""No, no, Baron Ned. Your words are spoken in kindness, but what you"
suggest is impossible. Perhaps if there had been fewer obstacles between
"us, or if I had not misjudged him so cruelly, I might have found my heart"
"more obedient to my will."""
The only comfort I could give my beautiful cousin was that a letter would
"soon come explaining everything. In default of a letter, I promised to go"
"to Paris and learn the truth from George's friends, if possible."
"Frances did not go back to Whitehall that day, but remained at home,"
pretending to be ill of an ague.
"At the end of a week, Frances not having returned to Whitehall, Sir"
"Richard was honored by a visit from no less a person than the king,"
"who thinks a diamond is the truth and paste a lie, is a stupid fool who"
doesn’t deserve to be read.’”
"“Yes, all right: you take one point of view and he takes another. I"
understand why Ruskin wouldn’t please you. What I do not understand is
why you find it absurd that if a person has a desire to penetrate into
"the beauties of a symphony or a picture, he should do so. What is there"
strange in that?”
"“You are right,” said Cæsar; “whoever wants to learn, should. I have"
done so about financial questions.”
“Is it true that your brother knows all about questions of money?”
Kennedy asked Laura.
“He says so.”
“I haven’t much belief in his financial knowledge.”
“No?”
"“No, I have not. You are a sort of dilettante, half nihilist, half"
"financier. You would like to pass for a tranquil, well-balanced man, for"
"what is called a philistine, but you cannot compass it.”"
"“I will compass it. It is true that I want to be a philistine, but a"
philistine out in the real world. All those great artists you people
"admire, Goethe, Ruskin, were really philistines, who were in the"
business of being interested in poetry and statues and pictures.”
"“Moncada, you are a sophist,” said Kennedy. “Possibly I am wrong in this"
"discussion,” retorted Cæsar, “but the feeling I have is right. Artists"
"machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square"
"metal plates everywhere. That is all I know."""
"Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two"
guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and
"contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the"
"piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly,"
commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue
eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on
with a mighty bound.
"""We have in ally in her,"" murmured Brand. ""Though God only knows if"
"that will mean anything to us...."""
CHAPTER IV
_In the Tower_
"""What I can't figure out,"" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare"
"room, ""is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor."
"They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they"
"could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it."""
"Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive"
study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive
"power. ""If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know"
better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar
magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions
say that the woman only suffers in such cases; the man never.  Whether
that rule proves always true will be shown in this strange story of my
own love.
"She drew her hand away slowly, but forcibly, saying:"
"""You cannot love two women.  Already you have shown a preference for a"
"wife of your own people."""
"""It is all over between us,"" I protested.  ""Mine was a mere passing"
"fancy, engendered, I think, by the loneliness I suffered when I lost"
"you."""
"""Ah,"" (she smiled sadly), ""that is all very well!  A woman, when once"
"played false by the man she loves and trusts, is never the"
"same--_never_!"""
"""Then am I to understand, Yolande, that you refuse to pardon me, or to"
"accept my affection?"""
"""I have already pardoned you,"" she faltered; ""but to accept the love you"
"once withdrew from me without just reason is, I regret to say,"
"impossible."""
"""You speak coldly, as though you were refusing a mere invitation to"
"dinner, or something of no greater importance,"" I protested.  ""I offer"
"you my whole heart, my love--nay, my life;"" and I held her hand again,"
"looking straight into those wonderful eyes, now so calm, so serious,"
that my gaze wavered before them.
"Slowly she shook her head, and her trembling breast rose and fell again."
And then madness descended upon and occupied James Williams. He pushed
his hat far upon the back of his head.
"“My wife seems to think I am a burglar,” he said, recklessly. “I never"
"heard of her being crazy; therefore I must be. And if I’m crazy, they"
can’t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness.”
Whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops
"had to be whistled for, and afterwards the reserves, to disperse a few"
thousand delighted spectators.
At the station-house the desk sergeant asked for his name.
"“McDoodle, the Pink, or Pinky the Brute, I forget which,” was James"
Williams’s answer. “But you can bet I’m a burglar; don’t leave that
out. And you might add that it took five of ’em to pluck the Pink. I’d
especially like to have that in the records.”
"In an hour came Mrs. James Williams, with Uncle Thomas, of Madison"
"Avenue, in a respect-compelling motor car and proofs of the hero’s"
innocence—for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an
automobile mfg. co.
After the police had sternly reprimanded James Williams for imitating a
copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the
"department was capable of, Mrs. Williams rearrested him and swept him"
into an angle of the station-house. James Williams regarded her with
one eye. He always said that Donovan closed the other while somebody
was holding his good right hand. Never before had he given her a word
of reproach or of reproof.
"standing, his great height bringing him so near to the low boards of the"
loft where her lover was lying that it seemed as though he must hear the
"wounded man's breathing, all other feelings were swept away by"
overwhelming fear. With the one thought that she must get rid of
"him,--do anything, say anything, but get rid of him quickly, she forced"
"herself forward, with extended hand, and said in a voice that held out"
new promise:
"""Good-night. Jack Rance,--good-night!"""
"Rance seized the hand with an almost fierce gladness in both his own,"
"his keen glance hungrily striving to read her face. Then, suddenly, he"
"released her, drawing back his hand with a quick sharpness."
"""Why, look at my hand! There's blood on it!"" he said."
"And even as he spoke, under the yellow flare of the lamp, the Girl saw a"
"second drop of blood fall at her feet. Like a flash, the terrible"
significance of it came upon her. Only by self-violence could she keep
"her glance from rising, tell-tale, to the boards above."
"""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" she heard herself saying contritely, all the time"
"desperately groping to invent a reason; at length, she added futilely:"
"""I must have scratched you."""
"Rance looked puzzled, staring at the spatter of red as though"
hypnotised.
"""No, there's no scratch there,"" he contended, wiping off the blood with"
his handkerchief.
"""Oh, yes, there is,"" insisted the Girl tremulously; ""that is, there will"
Tildy could not keep the delightful secret. When trade was slack she
went and stood at Bogle’s desk. Her eyes were shining; she tried not to
let her words sound proud and boastful.
"“A gentleman insulted me to-day,” she said. “He hugged me around the"
waist and kissed me.”
"“That so?” said Bogle, cracking open his business armour. “After this"
week you get a dollar a week more.”
At the next regular meal when Tildy set food before customers with whom
"she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly, as one whose"
merit needed no bolstering:
“A gentleman insulted me to-day in the restaurant. He put his arm
around my waist and kissed me.”
"The diners accepted the revelation in various ways—some incredulously,"
some with congratulations; others turned upon her the stream of
badinage that had hitherto been directed at Aileen alone. And Tildy’s
"heart swelled in her bosom, for she saw at last the towers of Romance"
rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long
travelled.
For two days Mr. Seeders came not again. During that time Tildy
"established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed. She bought ribbons,"
"and arranged her hair like Aileen’s, and tightened her waist two"
inches. She had a thrilling but delightful fear that Mr. Seeders would
rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol. He must have loved her
desperately; and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous.
"how the merchant passed the factory and disappeared into the wood, and"
he wished very much that he might fall and break all his bones.  He sat
"imagining many horrible forms of disaster while watching Petunikoff,"
who was descending the hill into the wood like a spider going into its
web.  Last night he even imagined that the wood gave way before the
merchant and he fell ... but afterwards he found that he had only been
dreaming.
"And to-day, as always, the red building stands out before the eyes of"
"Aristid Kuvalda, so plain, so massive, and clinging so strongly to the"
"earth, that it seems to be sucking away all its life.  It appears to be"
laughing coldly at the Captain with its gaping walls.  The sun pours
its rays on them as generously as it does on the miserable hovels of
the main street.
"""Devil take the thing!"" exclaimed the Captain, thoughtfully measuring"
"the walls of the factory with his eyes. ""If only ..."""
Trembling with excitement at the thought that had just entered his
"mind, Aristid Kuvalda jumped up and ran to Vaviloff's eating-house,"
muttering to himself all the time.
"Vaviloff met him at the bar, and gave him a friendly welcome."
"""I wish your honour good health!""  He was of middle height, and had a"
"bald head, grey hair, and straight moustaches like tooth-brushes."
"Upright and neat in his clean jacket, he showed by every movement that"
he was an old soldier.
"""Egorka, show me the lease and plan of your house,"" demanded Kuvalda,"
impatiently.
"He was interrupted by Monsieur, himself, who emerged from the"
companionway door.
"""I come again,"" he smiled apologetically, ""because tomorrow our journeys"
"part, and I have shown scant consideration for your kindness."""
"""It's we who feel the obligation,"" Tommy murmured. ""Now, if we could"
"only help you find the child--supposing, of course, that's what you're"
"watching for!"""
"Monsieur gave a deep sigh, appearing to be quite overcome by a secret"
"grief; but after a moment he looked at us, asking ingenuously:"
"""You think my behavior unusual?"""
"""Well, since you make a point of it,"" I laughed, and hesitated."
"""I see, I see! But, my young friends, you must take my word that I"
"cannot tell you much."" He drew us nearer. ""This I may say: that, after"

"Near them, at a table close by, was a little blond man, with a hooked"
"nose and a scanty imperial, in company with a fat lady. They bowed to"
Marchmont and his wife.
"“That gentleman looks like a Jew,” said Cæsar."
"“He is,” replied Marchmont, “that is Señor Pereyra, a rich Jew; of"
"Portuguese origin, I think.”"
“How quickly you saw it!” exclaimed Susanna.
"“He has that air of a sick goat, so frequent in Jews.”"
"“His wife has nothing sickly about her, or thin either,” remarked Laura."
"“No,” said Cæsar; “his wife represents another Biblical type; one of"
"the fat kine of somebody’s dream, which foretold abundance and a good"
harvest.”
"The Englishman, Kennedy, had also little liking for Jews."
"“I do not hate a Jew as anti-Christian,” said Cæsar; “but as"
"super-Christian. Nor do I hate the race, but the tendency they have"
"never to be producers, but always middlemen, and because they incarnate"
"so well for our era the love of money, and of joy and pleasure.”"
"The English author was a great partisan of Jews, and he asserted that"
they were more distinguished in science and the arts than any other
"race. The Jewish question was dropped in an instant, when they saw a"

Not many minutes had passed after their perilous descent when a sphere
"of fire shot from the clouds, followed by a crash as if the earth had"
"been rent in twain, and the western tower of Astura was seen toppling"
into the sea.
"Bye and bye sea and land reflected a crimson glow, which steadily"
"increased, fanned by the gale, until it shone far out upon the sea."
"Astura was in flames, the funeral pyre of the Frangipani."
CHAPTER VII
THE QUEST
"As the world grew gray with waking light, Francesco came from the"
woods and heard the noise of the sea in the hush that breathed in the
dawn. The storm had passed over the sea and a vast calm hung upon the
lips of the day. In the east a green streak shone above the hills. The
sky was still aglitter with sparse stars. An immensity of gloom
brooded over the sea.
"Gaunt, wounded, triumphant, Francesco rode up beneath the banners of"
"the dawn, eager yet fearful, inspired and strong of purpose. Wood and"
hill slept in a haze of mist. The birds were only beginning in the
"thickets, like the souls of children yet unborn, calling to eternity."
"Beyond in the cliffs, San Nicandro, wrapped round with night, stood"
silent and sombre athwart the west.
"replied, her powdered face again puckering into a smile.  ""Do you want"
"to know my honest opinion?"" she added."
"""Yes, I do."""
"""Well,"" she went on, ""I attach very little importance to the rumours of"
a projected sale or lease of Ceuta to us.  I might tell you in
"confidence,"" she went on, dropping her voice, ""that from some words I"
overheard at the garden-party at de Wolkenstein's I have come to a firm
"conclusion that, although during the next few years important changes"
"will be made upon the map of the world, Ceuta will remain Spanish.  My"
country will never menace yours in the Mediterranean at that point.  A
Ministry might be found in Madrid to consider the question of its
"disposal, but the Spanish people would rise in revolution before they"
"would consent.  Spain is very poor, but very proud.  Having lost so many"
"of her foreign possessions, she will hold more strongly than ever to"
"Ceuta.  There you have the whole situation in a nutshell."""
"""Then the report that it is actually sold to France is untrue?""  I asked"
eagerly.
"""A mere report I believe it to be."""
"""But Spain's financial indebtedness to France might prove an element of"
danger when Europe justifies Lord Beaconsfield's prediction and rushes
"into war over Morocco?"""
"""Ah, my dear M'sieur Ingram, I do not agree with the prediction of your"
"great statesman,"" the old lady said vehemently.  ""It is not in that"
"direction in which lies the danger of war, but at the other end of the"
"Mediterranean."""
XXII
"I muse on all this, and understand that her staying here is somehow"
"connected with her carnal desires, with the fact that Solem is still here."
"How muddled it all is, and how this handsome girl has been spoiled! I saw"
"her not long ago, tall and proud, upright, untouched, walking"
"intentionally close to Solem, yet not replying to his greeting. Did she"
suspect him of complicity in the death of the lawyer and avoid him for
"that reason? Not in the least; she avoided him less than before, even"
"letting him take her letters to the post office, which she had not done"
"previously. But she was unbalanced, a poor thing that had lost her"
"bearings. Whenever she could, she secretly defiled herself with pitch,"
with dung; she sniffed at foulness and was not repelled.
"One day, when Solem swore a needlessly strong oath at a horse that was"
"restless, she looked at him, shivered, and went a deep red. But she"
"mastered herself at once, and asked Josephine:"
"""Isn't that man leaving soon?"""
"""Yes,"" Josephine replied, ""in a few days."""
Though she had seized this opportunity to ask her question with a great
"show of indifference, I am certain it was an important one to her. She"
went away in silence.
"Yes, Miss Torsen stayed, for she was sexually bound to Solem. Solem's"
"despair, Solem's rough passion that she herself had inflamed, his"
"""With all my heart!"" cried the soldier."
"Petunikoff was silent for a moment, then looked at him, and suddenly"
"asked, coldly and drily, ""And why do you wish to do so?"""
"Vaviloff did not expect such a question, and therefore had no reply"
ready.  In his opinion the question was quite unworthy of any
"attention, and so he laughed at young Petunikoff."
"""That is easy to understand.  Men like to live peacefully with one"
"another."""
"""But,"" interrupted Petunikoff, ""that is not exactly the reason why.  As"
"far as I can see, you do not distinctly understand why you wish to be"
"reconciled to us ...  I will tell you."""
"The soldier was a little surprised.  This youngster, dressed in a check"
"suit, in which he looked ridiculous, spoke as if he were Colonel"
"Rakshin, who used to knock three of the unfortunate soldier's teeth out"
every time he was angry.
"""You want to be friends with us because we should be such useful"
neighbours to you ... because there will be not less than a hundred and
"fifty workmen in our factory, and in course of time even more.  If a"
"hundred men come and drink one glass at your place, after receiving"
"their weekly wages, that means that you will sell every month four"
"hundred glasses more than you sell at present.  This is, of course, the"
lowest estimate ... and then you have the eating-house besides.  You
"are not a fool, and you can understand for yourself what profitable"
"neighbours we shall be."""
"""My poor Yolande!  My poor daughter!""  Finding that my endeavours to"
"console her were futile, I went forth and made inquiries of the three"
frightened maidservants regarding what had occurred.
"One of them, a dark-eyed Frenchwoman in frilled cap, whom I had seen on"
"my previous visit, said, in answer to my questions:"
"""Jean discovered the poor mademoiselle in the petit salon about a"
quarter of an hour after m'sieur had left.  She was lying upon her face
"near the window, quite rigid.  He shouted; we all rushed in, and on"
"examining her found that she was already dead."""
"""But was there no sign of a struggle?""  I inquired, leading the way to"
the room indicated.
"""The room was just as m'sieur sees it now,"" she answered, with a wave of"
her hand.
"I glanced around, but as far as I could distinguish it was exactly as I"
had left it.
"""There was no mark of violence--nothing to show that mademoiselle had"
"been the victim of foul play?"""
"""Nothing, m'sieur."""
Could it have been a case of suicide?  I wondered.  Yolande's words
"before I had taken leave of her were desponding, and almost led me to"
believe that she had taken her life rather than face the man Wolf who
had so suddenly arrived in Paris--the man who exercised upon her some
"mysterious influence, the nature of which I could not guess."
"""Absolutely."""
"""It would, moreover, not be possible for anyone to enter or leave"
"without your knowledge?""  I suggested."
"""M'sieur understands me perfectly.  Mademoiselle must have fallen to the"
"floor lifeless immediately after I had let you out.  She made no sound,"
"and had Jean not entered with her letters, which the concierge had"
"brought, my poor young mistress might be lying there now."""
The average Frenchwoman of the lower class is always dramatic wherever a
"domestic calamity is concerned, and this worthy bonne was no exception."
She punctuated all her remarks with references to the sacred personages
of the Roman Catholic religion.
"""You haven't searched the room, I suppose?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Madame gave orders that nothing was to be touched."""
This reply was eminently satisfactory.  I glanced again around the
"place, now dim in the falling twilight, and ordered her to throw back"
the sun-shutters.
"The woman went to the window and opened them, admitting a flood of"
"mellow light, the last crimson of the glorious afterglow.  Up from the"
"boulevard came the dull roar of the traffic, mingling with the sound of"
"distant bells ringing the Ave Maria.  The bonne--an Alsatian, from her"
"accent--crossed herself from force of habit, and retreated towards the"
door.
"""You may go,"" I said.  ""I will remain here until the doctor arrives."""
At last they had reached the high plateau. A dog barked. The wood
suddenly swarmed with bearded and grotesque forms. They did not
recognize in Francesco the monk who had spent a night in their midst.
"The goatherd had maliciously disappeared, as if to revenge himself for"
his interrupted orisons. With glowering faces they thronged around
"Francesco, a babel of voices shouting questions and threatening the"
intruder.
"He waved them contemptuously aside, and his demeanor seemed to raise"
him in their regards.
At his request to be forthwith conducted into the presence of the
"duke, one pointed to a low building at the edge of the plateau. Wisps"
of smoke curled out of it and vanished into the night.
"""The duke and the Abbot are at orisons,"" the man said with a grimace,"
"the meaning of which was lost upon Francesco. ""He will not return"
"before midnight."""
"""I will await him here,"" said the newcomer, dismounting and leading"
"his steed to a small plot of pasture, where the grass was tall and"
"untrodden. Then, spent as he was, he requested food and drink, and as"
"he joined the band of outlaws, listening to their jokes and banter, he"
"thought he could discern among them many a one whom Fate had, like"
"himself, buffeted into a life, not of his forming, not of his choice."
CHAPTER V
THE ABBEY OF FARFA
"Mr. Dugald ran with all speed to Rockman's, the other men after him. As"
their hurrying steps echoed through the silent street heads popped out
"of windows, doors opened. Then more men, half-dressed and dressing as"
"they ran, rushed after them toward Rockman's. They knew, with that"
"intuition inbred in seacoast communities, that something was wrong. Old"
"Simon Tibbetts, too crippled to join the gathering crowds, rang up"
Commander Nelson at the Life Guard station on the backside.
"When, in the gray light of the dawn, the _Sally_ chugged up to"
"Rockman's wharf with its precious cargo Sidney and Mart found a weary,"
anxious crowd of men and women gathered there. And as Cap'n Davies and
Saunders lifted the girls ashore a lusty shout of rejoicing went
up--eager hands reached out to touch the rescued as though to make
certain they were safe and sound.
"Sidney had eyes only for Mr. Dugald who seemed to tower above them all,"
"his eyes dark lined with the strain of anxious watching, his mouth set"
"sternly. And strangely enough, at first, Dugald Allan saw only Sidney,"
"yet it was not strange, for the white-faced, shrinking, abject girl,"
"barefooted and disheveled, who was hiding behind Mart and Sidney, had"
little semblance to his gay young cousin.
Mr. Dugald opened his arms and Sidney ran into them like a little
"child, and clung to him. He felt her slender body shaking."
"""I--I can't help crying. I wanted Trude--so much!"""
"""_I_ was thinking of Trude, too. Thank God!"" But Sidney was too moved"
at the moment to wonder at his words or that the cheek he bent to hers
was wet with tears.
"""Since nakedness has always existed ..."""
"""Yes, and it created Rome,"" said the teacher."
"""Yes, of course,"" says the Captain, beaming with joy. ""Romulus and"
"Remus, eh?  We also shall create when our time comes ..."""
"""Violation of public peace,"" interrupts Abyedok.  He laughs in a"
"self-satisfied way.  His laughter is impudent and insolent, and is"
"echoed by Simtsoff, the Deacon and Paltara Taras.  The naive eyes of"
"young Meteor light up, and his cheeks flush crimson."
"Kanets speaks, and it seems as if he were hammering their heads."
"""All these are foolish illusions ... fiddle-sticks!"""
"It was strange to see them reasoning in this manner, these outcasts"
"from life, tattered, drunken with vodki and wickedness, filthy and"
forlorn.  Such conversations rejoiced the Captain's heart.  They gave
"him an opportunity of speaking more, and therefore he thought himself"
"better than the rest.  However low he may fall, a man can never deny"
"himself the delight of feeling cleverer, more powerful, or even better"
"fed than his companions. Aristid Kuvalda abused this pleasure, and"
"never could have enough of it, much to the disgust of Abyedok, Kubar,"
"and others of these creatures that once were men, who were less"
interested in such things.
"Politics, however, were more to the popular taste.  The discussions as"
to the necessity of taking India or of subduing England were lengthy
and protracted.  Nor did they speak with less enthusiasm of the radical
measure of clearing Jews off the face of the earth.  On this subject
“Don’t go. Send her an excuse--and take me for a drive. It would do me
"good, and I should so love to be alone with you.”"
It was the very first time in her life that Yvonne had consciously
cajoled a man. Her face flushed hot with misgivings. It was with a
mixture of her sex’s shame and triumph that she heard him say.
"“Whatever you like, dear. It is still your holiday.”"
CHAPTER XIII--Dis Aliter Visum
But the best laid schemes of Yvonnes and men often come to nothing.
"While she was devising, on her drive along the coast, a plan for"
"spending a quiet dangerless evening at the hotel, Mrs. Winstanley was"
"sitting in solitary dignity at the concert, nursing her wrath over"
"Professor Drummond’s “Natural Law in the Spiritual world,” a book which"
she often perused when she wished to accentuate the rigorous attitude of
her mind.
Yvonne had reckoned without Mrs. Winstanley. Otherwise she would have
"offered her a seat in the carriage. As it was, Mrs. Winstanley felt"
more resentful than ever. Under the impression that the Canon was to
"accompany her to the Kursaal, she had graciously dispensed with the"
"escort of the Wilmingtons, who had gone off to see bicycle races at the"
Vélodrome. She was left in the lurch.
To dislike this is human. To wrap oneself up in one’s sore dignity is
"more human still, and there was much humanity that lurked, unsuspected"
"by herself, in Mrs. Winstanley’s bosom. It asserted itself, further,"
"was striving after speech. Slyne, outwardly cool and contemptuous of his"
"visible fury, stood gazing down at him, hands in pockets. Mr. Jobling"
"was wriggling restlessly in his chair, glancing from one to the other,"
prepared to flee from the coming storm.
"Still without a word, Captain Dove reached again for the"
"brandy-decanter, directly defying Slyne. Slyne stepped forward and"
snatched it out of his hand.
"Simultaneously, the old man and Mr. Jobling sprang from their seats, the"
"former making for Slyne and the latter for the door, which opened just"
"as he reached it, so that he all but fell over a boy in buttons who had"
knocked and entered carrying a telegram on a tray.
"Slyne had not moved. Captain Dove, almost at his throat, spun round on"
one heel.
"""For me?"" Mr. Jobling exclaimed anxiously as he ripped the envelope"
open. And a slow pallor overspread his puffy pink features while he was
perusing its contents.
"""From Mullins, my managing clerk,"" he mumbled as he passed the message"
"to Slyne, who looked it over indifferently, and then re-read it aloud in"
"a low but very ominous voice: ""'_American claimant landed at Genoa"
yesterday. Now on way to London. Court granted decree in his favour._'
"Handed in at Chancery Lane, in London,""--he pulled out his watch--""fifty"
"minutes ago."""
The page-boy had disappeared. Slyne pushed suddenly past Mr. Jobling and
set his back against the door. Captain Dove was approaching the
"terrified solicitor softly, on tiptoe, his fists clenched, all his"
tobacco-stained fangs displayed in a grin of fury. One of his long arms
"""I am going up to try and see the Premier at the House to-day,"" he said."
"""I think we shall have to trouble him. You see, he knew Gaspard as well"
"as the deceased."""
"""I'll give you a lift. You can keep out of the way till he's at"
"leisure."""
"At this moment one of the police entered, and handed the Superintendent"
a copy of the _Evening Mail_.
"""It's as you feared, sir,"" he remarked as he went out."
"The Superintendent opened the paper, looked at it for an instant, and"
then indicated a passage with his forefinger.
"""It is rumoured,"" read Mr. Kilshaw, ""that certain very startling facts"
"have come to light regarding the identity of the deceased man Benham,"
"and that the name of a very prominent politician, now holding an exalted"
"office, is likely to be introduced into the case. As the matter will be"
"public property to-morrow, we may be allowed to state that trustworthy"
reports point to the fact of the Premier being in a position to give
some important information as to the past life of the deceased. It is
"said that a photograph of two persons, one of whom is Mr. Medland, has"
been discovered among the papers at Mr. Benham's (or we should say
Benyon's) lodgings. Further developments of this strange affair will be
"awaited with interest."""
"""I wish,"" commented the Superintendent grimly, ""that my men could keep a"
"secret as well as their man can sniff one out."""
But Mr. Kilshaw was too excited to listen.
plainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible
check-stations.
"""Not that baby,"" returned the computer confidently. ""I'll bet you a"
small farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his
goniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back
"into position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's"
"always been there."""
"""The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to"
"them?"""
"""Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody"
"anything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?"""
"""Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?"""
"""Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are"
altogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you.
"Another thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x."
"If so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all"
"off on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every"
"check-station. See?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"True to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact"
"center of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he"
began really to enjoy the trip.
"""How do we check on chronometers?"" asked P6 when Stevens had been"
"introduced. ""By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds"

was glad to see Frances.
*       *       *       *       *
"During the first week of Bettina's illness she was too sick to talk,"
therefore we did not remain long with her. But as she grew better our
"visits lengthened, and my poor resolutions grew weaker day by day because"
my love for the girl was growing stronger and stronger hour by hour.
"On one occasion while Frances's back was turned, Betty impulsively"
"snatched up my hand and kissed it, dropping it instantly, blushing"
intensely and covering her tracks by humming the refrain of a French
"lullaby. I longed to return the caress, but did not, and took great"
credit to myself because of my self-denial. Betty understood my sacrifice
"and appreciated it, feeling sure that she need not thereafter restrain"
herself for the purpose of restraining me.
During those times I was making an honest effort to do the right by this
beautiful child-woman and to save my own honor unsullied from the sin of
making her unhappy for life through winning her love beyond her power to
"recall; and my effort toward the right, like all such efforts, achieved"
at least a part of the good for which I strove.
"One day after our visit to Betty's room, Frances asked me to take her to"
"see George. I suspected that she had seen him frequently, but was not"
"sure. I objected, but changed my mind when she said:--"
"""Very well. I prefer going alone."""
I shall not try to describe the scene between them. We found George
"alone, and she sprang to him as the iron springs to the magnet."
"you."" And he fell to polishing his furry, old-fashioned top-hat with a"
"tail of the scanty, ill-fitting frock-coat he had donned along with a"
noisome waistcoat in honour of the occasion.
"Slyne shrugged his shoulders, despairingly, and, having made an end of"
"his unappetising meal, prepared for the road. Then he lighted a cigar"
"very much at his leisure, while Captain Dove regarded him grimly, and"
led the way on deck without further words.
"Sallie was ready and waiting at the companion-hatch on the poop, as"
pretty as a picture in the sables Captain Dove had given her a year
before--after a very lucrative season of poaching on the Siberian coast.
"As soon as she caught sight of them she came forward, followed by"
"Ambrizette, whose appearance, in cloak and turban, was even a worse"
offence to Slyne's fastidious taste than Captain Dove's had been.
"""What a calamitous circus!"" he muttered between set teeth. ""I must get"
rid of those two somehow--and soon. But till then--
"""My car's at the back of those coal-wagons there,"" he told Captain Dove"
"with great dignity, and Captain Dove turned to the engine-room hatch."
"""Below there!"" he called down. ""Is that Mr. Brasse? I'm off now, Brasse."
"You'll carry out all my instructions, eh? And--don't quarrel with Da"
"Costa, d'ye hear?"""
"""Ay, ay, sir,"" answered a dreary voice from the depths below, and"
"Captain Dove faced about again to find Sallie, flushed and anxious,"
waiting with Ambrizette at the gangway.
"""Come on,"" he ordered irascibly, and Sallie followed him down the"
"plank. Ambrizette shuffled fearfully after her, and Slyne came last, his"
to the minute. In his earlier days he had frequently felt the same
"nervousness, the same intense mental activity, just prior to an"
"important race or game, and he was familiar with those disquieting,"
"panicky moments when, for no apparent reason, his heart thumped and a"
"physical sickness mastered him. He knew that the fever would leave him,"
"once the salmon began to run, just as it had always vanished at the"
crack of the starter's pistol or the shrill note of the referee's
"whistle. He was eager for action, eager to find himself possessed of"
"that gloating, gruelling fury that drives men through to the finish"
"line. Meanwhile, he was anxious to divert his mind into other channels."
Cherry's house was situated a short distance above the cannery which
"served as Willis Marsh's headquarters, and Boyd's path necessarily took"
him past his enemy's very stronghold. Finding the tide too high to
"permit of passing beneath the dock, he turned up among the buildings,"
"where, to his surprise, he encountered his own day-foreman talking"
earnestly with a stranger.
"The fisherman started guiltily as he saw him, and Boyd questioned him"
sharply.
"""What are you doing here, Larsen?"""
"""I just walked up after supper to have a talk with an old mate."""
"""Who is he?"" Boyd glanced suspiciously at Larsen's companion."
"""He's Mr. Marsh's foreman."""
"Emerson spoke out bluntly: ""See here. I don't like this. These people"
"have caused me a lot of trouble already, and I don't want my men"
"hanging around here."""
"Alicia huddled herself in a heap on the sofa, turning her face to the"
wall. She felt Lady Eynesford's scornful rebuke like the stroke of a
"whip. She had descended to a vulgar wrangle, and had been worsted in it:"
the one thing of all which it concerned her to hide had by her own act
been opened to the jeer of a stranger; she had violated every rule of
good breeding and self-respect. No words--not even Lady
Eynesford's--were too strong to describe what she had done. Yet she
could not help it; she could not hear a creature like that abuse or
"condemn a man like Medland--though all that he had said she had said,"
"and more, to Medland himself. She was too miserable to think; she lay"
"with closed eyes and parted lips, breathing quickly, and restlessly"
moving her limbs in that strange physical discomfort which great
unhappiness brings with it.
"A footstep roused her; she sat up, hurriedly smoothing her hair and"
clutching at a book that lay on the table by her. The intruder was her
"brother, and fortunately he was too intent on the tidings he brought to"
notice her confusion.
"""Great news, Al!"" he cried. ""They've offered me Ireland. We shall start"
"home in a month."""
"""Home in a month?"" she echoed."
"""Yes. Splendid, isn't it?"""
"""You're pleased, Willie?"""

"shut in, I was happy; and here, sound and strong, when toward nightfall,"

the planet....”
_ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON_
His lack of tranquillity led Cæsar to make absurd resolutions which he
didn’t carry out.
"One Sunday in the beginning of April, he went out into the street,"
"disposed to take a walk outside of Rome, following the road anywhere it"
"led. A hard, fine rain was falling, the sky was grey, the air mild, the"
"streets were full of puddles, the shops closed; a few flower merchants"
were offering branches of almond in blossom.
Cæsar was very depressed. He went into a church to get out of the rain.
The church was full; there were many people in the centre of it; he
didn’t know what they were doing. Doubtless they were gathered there for
"some reason, although Cæsar didn’t understand what. Cæsar sat down on"
"a bench, worn out; he would have liked to listen to organ music, to a"
boy choir. No ideas occurred to him but sentimental ones. Some time
"passed, and a priest began to preach. Cæsar got up and went into the"
street.
"“I must get rid of these miserable impressions, get back to noble ideas."
I must fight this sentimental leprosy.”
"so, never fear. No power on earth could make me take up the old life"
"again."""
The Girl said nothing in reply; instead she put both her arms around his
"neck and remained a long time in his embrace. At last, summoning up all"
"her fortitude she put him resolutely from her, and whispered:"
"""When you are ready, come. You must leave me now."" And with a curt"
command to the Indian she fled back into the darkness.
For an instant the road agent's eyes followed the direction that she had
"taken; then, his spirits rising at the thought that his escape was now"
"well-nigh assured, he turned and plunged down the ravine."
"As a strong David, at the voice of verity,"
"Great Goliah, the pope, he struck down with his sling,"
Restoring again to a Christian liberty
"His land and people, like a most victorious king;"
To his first beauty intending the Church to bring
From ceremonies dead to the living word of the Lord.
This the second act will plenteously record.
"As put into the mouth of the king himself, these other lines are hard to"
beat for deliberate partisan misrepresentation. The king feels himself
about to die.
I have sore hungered and thirsted righteousness
"For the office sake that God hath me appointed,"
But now I perceive that sin and wickedness
"In this wretched world, like as Christ prophesied,"
disappointed when the smile with which she greeted me was the same she
would have given to any other man. But Mary was Mary. Nature and art had
"made her what she was--charming, quiescent, and calm, not cold, simply"
lukewarm.
"""I have seen little of you this last month,"" said Mary, taking my arm and"
walking with me away from De Grammont's group. She might have remarked
with equal emotion that Cromwell was dead or the weather fine. She did
"not wait for an explanation of my absence, but continued with a touch of"
"eager hesitancy and a fluttering show of anxiety, ""Have you had news"
"recently of my brother George?"""
"Of course I could not tell her the truth, so I answered evasively: ""I"
suppose you have heard the news spread throughout the court that he has
"gone to Canada? Doubtless you can tell me more than I know."""
"""That is all I know,"" she answered. ""When he went, or where, I have been"
"unable to learn, for George is a forbidden topic in our household and"
"seems to be the same at court. What has he done, baron? I have heard it"
hinted that he threatened to take the king's life. Surely he did nothing
"of the sort."""
"""If he did, it was in a delirium of fever,"" I answered, hoping that she"
would cease speaking of George and would ask a question or two concerning
myself.
"But no. She turned again to me, asking, ""Did you hear him?"""
"""I have been told that the accusation comes from his physician, and"
"perhaps from one who was listening at his door,"" I answered, avoiding a"
direct reply.
"We paraded, and marched off to work. The continuous roar gradually gave"
"place to irregular, though frequent, outbursts of firing along the"
entire front.
The next day the sound seemed to have come nearer. Rumours began to
"circulate--it was said that Armentières had fallen, that the Portuguese"
"had been annihilated at Merville, that the British had counter-attacked"
and taken Lille.
"Rations, newspapers and letters were delayed. Large bodies of troops"
"passed through the village. We got no definite or official news, and"
nobody had any clear notion of what was happening.
But the sound of firing grew louder and louder and our anxiety deepened.
There could no longer be any doubt about it--the Germans were advancing
on our front.
The sickening certainty transcended all other considerations. A few
miles from us thousands were being slaughtered. I ceased to ponder the
problems of failure and success. I forgot the politicians and was
"conscious of only one despairing wish, that the terrible thing might"
come to an end. Victory and defeat seemed irrelevant considerations. If
only the end would come quickly--nothing else really mattered.
I often wondered what was in the minds of the other men. Many of them
"looked anxious, but on the whole they were normal in their behaviour."
They grumbled and quarrelled much as usual and talked rather more than
"usual--but so did I, in spite of my intense mental agitation."
The sound of firing grew louder.
Dex started to reply to that; but Brand flung him a warning look.
"""Tell him we are the least of the Earth people,"" he answered steadily."
"""Tell him we are of an inferior race. Most of those on Earth are"
"giants five times as large as we are, and many times more powerful."""
"Greca relayed the message in the whistling, piping Rogan tongue. The"
"tall one stared, then hissed another sentence to the beautiful"
interpreter.
"""He wants to know,"" said Greca, ""if there are cities on your globe as"
"large and complete as this one."""
"""There are cities on Earth that make this look like a--a--"" Brand cast"
"about for understandable similes--""like a collection of animal"
"burrows."""
"""He says to describe your planet's war weapons,"" was the next"
interpretation. And here Brand let himself go.
"With flights of fancy he hadn't known he was capable of, he described"
"great airships, steered automatically and bristling with guns that"
discharged explosives powerful enough to kill everything within a
range of a thousand miles. He told of billions of thirty-foot giants
sheathed in an alloy that would make them invulnerable to any feeble
rays the Rogans might have developed. He touched on the certain
wholesale death that must overtake any hostile force that tried to
invade the planet.
"""The Rogan shock-tubes are toys compared with the ray-weapons of"
"Earth,"" he concluded. ""We have arms that can nullify the effects of"
"yours and kill at the same instant. We have--"""
CHAPTER XXII
HIS MOTHER'S ROSARY
"It was, as the soldier had said most truly, a cold morning to be shot"
"in. But the Carlists, accustomed to Cabrera's summary methods, appeared"
"to think but little of the matter, and jested as the firing parties were"
selected and drawn out. Ragged and desolate they looked as they stood on
"a slight slope between the foreigners and the red dawn, biting their"
cartridges and fingering the pulls of their rifles with hands numbed
with cold. At elbow and knee their rags of uniforms flapped like bunches
of ribbons at a fair.
"""In the garden!"" whispered Luis Fernandez to Cabrera."
"""To the garden!"" commanded the general, lighting a new cigarette and"
"puffing vigorously, ""and at this point I may as well bid you good-bye. I"
"wish our acquaintance had been pleasanter. But the fortune of war,"
gentlemen! My mother had not so long time to say her prayers at the
"hands of your friend Nogueras--and she was a woman and old, gentlemen. I"
"doubt not you know as well how to die as she?"""
"And they did. Not one of them uttered a word. John Mortimer, seeing"
"there was now no chance of making his thousand pounds, set an example"
"of unbending dignity. He comported himself, indeed, exactly as he would"
"have done on his marriage day. That is, he knew that the eyes of many"
"were upon him, and he resolved not to shame the performance. So he went"
through his part with the exact English mixture of awkward shyness and
It was the maid’s turn to look surprised.
"“I didn’t think he was to be here,” she said. “He’s had some—”"
"“Trouble at the office,” supplied Kennedy. “That’s what it was about."
Perhaps he hasn’t been able to get away yet. But I had the appointment.
"Ah, I see a telephone in the hall. May I?”"
"He had stepped politely in, and by dint of cleverly keeping his finger"
"on the hook in the half light, he carried on a one-sided conversation"
with himself long enough to get a good chance to look about.
There was an air of quiet and refinement about the apartment in the
Recherche. It was darkened to give the little glowing electric bulbs in
their silken shades a full chance to simulate right. The deep velvety
"carpets were noiseless to the foot, and the draperies, the pictures,"
"the bronzes, all bespoke taste."
But the chief objects of interest to Craig were the little square green
baize-covered tables on one of which lay neatly stacked a pile of
"gilt-edged cards and a mahogany box full of ivory chips of red, white"
and blue.
"It was none of the old-time gambling places, like Danfield’s, with its"
steel door which Craig had once cut through with an oxyacetylene
blowpipe in order to rescue a young spendthrift from himself.
Kennedy seemed perfectly well satisfied merely with a cursory view of
"the place, as he hung up the receiver and thanked the maid politely for"
allowing him to use it.
CHAPTER XX.
THE LAW _VERSUS_ RULE 3.
Among the many tired but satisfied lovers of liberty who sought their
"houses that night, while an enthusiastic remnant was still parading the"
"streets, illuminations yet shining from windows, and weary police"
"treading their unending beats, was the doorkeeper, who had borne a"
banner in Company A of Procession 1. His friend the watchmaker came with
"him, to have a bit of supper and exchange congratulations and"
"fulminations. Hardly, however, had the doorkeeper pledged the cause in a"
first draught when his wife broke in on his oration by handing him a
"letter, which she said a boy in a blue jersey had left for him about ten"
"o'clock in the morning, just after he had started to join his company."
The envelope was cheap and coarse; there was no direction outside. The
doorkeeper opened it. It was addressed to no named person and it bore no
"signature. It was very brief, being confined to these simple words--""You"
"did not see me last night. Remember Rule 3."""
"The doorkeeper laid the letter down, with a hurried glance at his"
"friend, whose face was buried in a mug. He knew the handwriting; he knew"
"who it was that he had not seen; he remembered Rule 3, the rule that"
"said--""The only and inevitable penalty of treachery is death."" He turned"
white and took a hasty gulp at his liquor.
"""Who brought this?"" he asked."
"""I told you,"" answered his wife; ""a lad in a blue jersey; he looked as"
"if he might be from the harbour."" She put food before them, adding as"
"dairy--I have a kitchen. Milk the goats here, I command you, nowhere but"
"here!"""
"And thrusting the bucket into the old woman's hand, she watched"
carefully and eagerly as La Giralda pressed the milk downwards in
hissing streams. The she-goat operated upon expressed her gratitude by
turning to lick the hand which relieved her.
At this the little girl danced with delight.
"""It looks so easy--I could do it myself! I am sure of it. I tell you,"
"Susana, I will do it. Stand still, _cabra_! Do you not know that I am"
"Isabel the Second, Queen of all the Spains!"""
"But the she-goat, having no very strong monarchial sentiments, or"
"perhaps being inclined to Carlist opinions, as soon as she felt the grip"
of unaccustomed fingers promptly kicked over in the dust the Queen of
all the Spains.
The little girl had not time to gather herself up or even to emit the
"howl of disappointment and anger which hovered upon her lips, before her"
attendant rushed at her with pitiful cries:
"""Oh, the wicked goat! The devil-possessed emblem of Satan! Let it be"
slain! Did not your poor Susana warn you to have nothing to do with such
"evil things--thus to overturn in the dust the best, the sweetest, the"
"noblest of Princesses!"""
"But the best and sweetest of Princesses, having violent objections to"
"being gathered up into the capacious embrace of her nurse, especially"
"before company, vigorously objected in much the same manner as the goat"
"had done, and at last compelled Doña Susana to deposit her once more on"
"""The Magic Apples"" (_Norske Eventyr og Sagn_, optegnet av Sophus"
"Bugge og Rikard Berge, Christiania, 1909, p. 61) is probably a"
somewhat original version of one of the cycles of tales in which
"people acquire asses' ears, long noses, humped backs and other"
"adornments, through eating some enchanted fruit. The British Isles"
"are believed to be the home-land of this tale, and it is thought"
to have emigrated to Scandinavia by way of France and Germany.
XIV
SELF DID IT
"Once upon a time there was a mill, in which it was impossible to grind"
"flour, because such strange things kept happening there. But there was a"
"poor woman who was in urgent need of a little meal one evening, and she"
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during
"the night. ""For heaven's sake,"" said the mill-owner, ""that is quite"
"impossible! There are ghosts enough in the mill as it is."" But the woman"
said that she must grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
"in the house with which to make mush, and there was nothing for her"
children to eat. So at last he allowed her to go to the mill at night
"and grind some flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big"
"tar-barrel that was standing there; got the mill going, sat down by the"
"fire, and began to knit. After a time a girl came in and nodded to her."
"""Good evening!"" said she to the woman. ""Good evening!"" said the woman;"
"kept her seat, and went on knitting. But then the girl who had come in"
began to pull apart the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again.
"""I want to go to Siberia ...  I have had enough of this vile life ..."
"one learns how to live there!"""
"""Yes, they have a particularly good way of teaching in Siberia,"" agreed"
"the Captain, sadly."
"They spoke no more of Petunikoff, or of the turning out of the"
inhabitants of the dosshouse.  They all knew that they would have to
"leave soon, therefore they did not think the matter worth discussion."
"It would do no good, and besides the weather was not very cold though"
the rains had begun ... and it would be possible to sleep on the ground
anywhere outside the town.  They sat in a circle on the grass and
"conversed about all sorts of things, discussing one subject after"
"another, and listening attentively even to the poor speakers in order"
to make the time pass; keeping quiet was as dull as listening.  This
"society of ""creatures that once were men"" had one fine"
characteristic--no one of them endeavoured to make out that he was
"better than the others, nor compelled the others to acknowledge his"
superiority.
The August sun seemed to set their tatters on fire as they sat with
their backs and uncovered heads exposed to it ... a chaotic mixture of
"the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms. In the corners of the yard"
the tall steppe grass grew luxuriantly....  Nothing else grew there but
"some dingy vegetables, not even attractive to those who nearly always"
felt the pangs of hunger.
*      *      *      *      *
The following was the scene that took place in Vaviloff's eating-house.
"Young Petunikoff entered slowly, took off his hat, looked around him,"
"years. What then would be said if I----"""
"""Nay, then,"" cried Maria Cristina, ""stay where you are, Susana. For me,"
"I am none so nice. I will go myself. Do not follow me, Fernando!"" And"
"with that she ran to the door, and her feet were heard flitting up the"
stairway which led to the servants' wing of the palace. Muñoz made as if
"to accompany her, but remembering his wife's prohibition, he did not"
"proceed farther than the door, where, with a curious smile upon his"
"face, he stood listening to the voice of the Queen-Regent upraised in"
alternate appeal and rebuke.
"During the interval, while the Sergeant and El Sarria were looking to"
"their stores and munitions, Rollo approached the waiting-maid, Susana,"
"and inquired of her the way to the armoury, where he expected to find"
store of arms and powder.
"""If this young maid will go also, I will conduct you thither, young"
"man!"" said Susana, primly."
"And holding Concha firmly by the hand, she took up a candle and led the"
way.
But to Rollo's surprise they found the armoury wholly sacked. All the
valuable guns had been removed by the deserting guards. The gun racks
were torn down. The floor of beaten earth was strewed with flints of
ancient pieces of last century's manufacture. The barrels of
"bell-mouthed blunderbusses leaned against the wall, the stocks, knocked"
"off in mere wantonness, were piled in corners; and in all the chests and"
wall-presses there was not an ounce of powder to be found.
"While Rollo was searching, Señor Muñoz appeared at the door, languid and"
careless as ever. He watched the young Scot opening chests and rummaging
The Captain in such cases put on a serious face and began speaking with
"killing irony on the theme of weakness of character, of the animal"
"delight of intoxication, and on such subjects as suited the occasion."
One must do him justice: he was captivated by his role of mentor and
"moralist, but the lodgers dogged him, and, listening sceptically to his"
"exhortations to repentance, would whisper aside to each other:"
"""Cunning, skilful, shifty rogue!  I told you so, but you would not"
"listen.  It's your own fault!"""
"""His honour is really a good soldier.  He goes first and examines the"
"road behind him!"""
The teacher then hunted here and there till he found his friend again
"in some corner, and grasping his dirty coat, trembling and licking his"
"dry lips, looked into his face with a deep, tragic glance, without"
articulate words.
"""Can't you?"" asked the Captain sullenly."
The teacher answered by bowing his head and letting it fall on his
"breast, his tall, thin body trembling the while."
"""Wait another day ... perhaps you will be all right then,"" proposed"
"Kuvalda.  The teacher sighed, and shook his head hopelessly."
The Captain saw that his friend's thin body trembled with the thirst
"for the poison, and took some money from his pocket."
"""In the majority of cases it is impossible to fight against fate,"" said"
"he, as if trying to justify himself before someone. But if the teacher"
Before long the novelty of the Tore Peak resort wore off again. The
"newspapermen wrote and sent telegrams about other gratifying misfortunes,"
the death on the Blue Peak having lost its news value. It had been an
intoxication; now came the morning after.
The Danish mountaineer quite simply deserted. He strapped on his knapsack
"and walked across the field like one of the villagers, caring no more for"
the Blue Peak. The commotion he had witnessed in the last week had taught
him a lesson.
And the tourists swarmed on to other places.
"""What harm have I done them,"" Paul probably"
"thought, ""that they should be going again? Have I been"
too much in the fields and too little with them? But I
greeted them humbly and took my man out of the
"harvesting work to help them...."""
"Then two young men arrived, sprouts off the Norwegian tree, sportsmen to"
"their finger tips, who talked of nothing but sailing, cycling, and"
"football; they were going to be civil engineers--the young Norway. They,"
"too, wanted to see the Blue Peak to the best of their ability; after all,"
one must keep pace with modern life. But they were so young that when they
"looked up at the peak, they were afraid. Solem had learned more than one"
"trick in tourist company; craftily he led them on, and then extorted money"
from them in return for a promise not to expose their foolishness. So all
"was well; the young sprouts came down the mountain again, bragging and"
showing off their sportsmanship. One of them brought down a bloodstained
"rag which he flung on the ground, saying,"
"""There's what's left of your lawyer that fell off."""
"with an inefficient chauffeur, so naturally wanted to secure the best"
man that could be got.
"I must here explain that I possessed an English chauffeur, Allan"
"by name, and that General Kitson employed his brother in the same"
"capacity. Now, without any disparagement of _my_ Allan, I knew his"
brother to be a more practical and experienced man. General Kitson
generously gave his consent to an exchange of chauffeurs.
"I may as well say, at once, that it was a lucky day for me that saw"
"Allan of the 9th Middlesex Regiment enter my service, for, during"
"the months to come, he was as cheery and full of resource as he was"
"ready for any event, however untoward. His appetite stood forth as"
"the only thing that ever caused me uneasiness, and I must admit that"
I have never met a man with one of such colossal proportion. As an
"instance--on one occasion, when camped out in the desert, between"
"Nushki and Robat, and supplies were none too plentiful, we cooked"
twelve sausages for breakfast.
"I had one, and then was persuaded by Allan to attempt a second. I"
only succeeded in disposing of half of it. I then got up and left
"Allan to have his own breakfast. Allah-dad, being a Mahommedan, of"
course refused to touch sausage.
"At lunch-time Allah-dad asked what I would have to eat, and got the"
"answer, ""Oh, some of the cold sausages left from breakfast."""
"Allah-dad replied, ""But there are no sausages, Sahib. Allan has eaten"
"them all."""
"I expostulated, maintaining that it was impossible. No normal man"
could have eaten ten and a half large sausages. But Allah-dad was
"""Aren't you?"" she repeated, more sweetly imperious."
"""You bet,"" I stammered."
"""Then do hurry! It's almost ten, and I've been waiting such a long"
"time!"""
"Whereupon I heard her moving off, pressing her hands against the panels"
"for steadiness, and there struck me as having been an endearing pathos"
"in the way she said: ""such a long time!"""
"This was, no doubt, some of Tommy's doing. He had invited friends aboard"
"for luncheon, and was now daring one of them to play this joke. But my"
"glance turned to the room, to its equipment and toilette articles which"
"were large and curiously shaped, and the numbing truth crept into my"
brain that the stupid boatman had put me on the wrong yacht.
"I had known some tight places in France, but this one simply squeezed me"
"all over. There was nothing for it, of course, but go out and"
explain--yet how could a chap appear at noon draped in a sheet! The
"situation confused me, but I decided to search the wardrobe, of my"
"unknown host, to borrow his razor, appropriate a new toothbrush that"
"should be found in a box somewhere, and select flannels and linens in"
keeping with the hour. Still balanced between confusion and panic I must
"have done these things because, fittingly attired though with no very"
"good fit, I opened my door, stepped softly along the passageway, and"
entered the cabin.
On a wide couch built in at one side a girl lay reading. Her head was
"toward me, but as I advanced she arose with a low cry of gladness,"
saying:
doing as she asked.
"But because his heart was not of iron, and there are few men that can"
"resist when a woman comes and woos them, he at last gave way; and they"
"fled away one night, the girl and the slave, taking with them her jewels"
"and some money. They travelled rapidly and in great fear, and did not"
"rest till they came to a city far away where the merchant would never,"
"they thought, think of searching for them."
"Here, in this city where no one knew of their history, they lived in"
"great happiness, husband and wife, trading with the money they had with"
them.
And in time a little child was born to them.
About two or three years after this it became necessary for the husband
"to take a journey, and he started forth with his wife and child. The"
"journey was a very long one, and they were unduly delayed; and so it"
"happened that while still in the forest the wife fell ill, and could not"
"go on any further. So the husband built a hut of branches and leaves,"
"and there, in the solitude of the forest, was born to them another"
little son.
"The mother recovered rapidly, and in a little time she was well enough"
to go on. They were to start next morning on their way again; and in the
"evening the husband went out, as was his custom, to cut firewood, for"
the nights were cold and damp.
"Ma Pa Da waited and waited for him, but he never came back."
"The sun set and the dark rose out of the ground, and the forest became"
"full of whispers, but he never came. All night she watched and waited,"
At Bruges they were told that the train would not leave for Ghent
and Brussels for another two hours--some mobilization delay; so Hawk
proposed they should go and see the Memlings and then have some
dinner.
"""Don't you think they're perfectly wonderful?""--_àpropos_ of the"
pictures in the Hospital of St. Jean.
"_Vivie_: ""It depends on what you mean by 'wonderful.' If you admire"
the fidelity of the reproduction in colour and texture of the
"Flemish costumes of the fifteenth century, I agree with you. It is"
also interesting to see the revelations of their domestic
"architecture and furniture of that time, and the types of domestic"
"dog, cow and horse. But if you admire them as being true pictures of"
"life in Palestine in the time of Christ, or in the Rhineland of the"
"fifth century, then I think they--like most Old Masters--are"
perfectly rotten. And have you ever remarked another thing about all
"paintings prior to the seventeenth century: how _plain_, how _ugly_"
all the people are? You never see a single good-looking man or
woman. Do let's go and have that dinner you spoke of. I've got a
"prison appetite."""
At Ghent another delay and a few uneasy rumours. The Court was said
to be removing from Brussels and establishing itself at Antwerp. The
train at last drew into the main station at Brussels half an hour
after midnight. Vivie's mother was nowhere to be seen. She had
evidently gone back to the Villa Beau-séjour while she could. It was
too late for any tram in the direction of Tervueren. There were no
taxis owing to the drivers being called up. Leaving most of her
luggage at the cloak-room--it took her about three-quarters of an
"“Nothing, fortunately,” he said, then went on slowly. “You see, in my"
"later years, I have been something of a collector of precious stones"
"myself. I don’t wear them, but I have always taken the keenest pleasure"
in owning them and when I was married it gave me a great deal more
"pleasure to have them set in rings, pendants, tiaras, necklaces, and"
other forms for my wife.”
"He had risen, with the air of a busy man who had given the subject all"
the consideration he could afford and whose work proceeded almost by
"schedule. “This morning I found my safe tampered with, but, as I said,"
fortunately something must have scared off the burglars.”
"He bowed us out politely. What was the explanation, I wondered. It"
"seemed, on the face of things, that Antoinette Moulton feared her"
"husband. Did he know something else already, and did she know he knew?"
"To all appearances he took it very calmly, if he did know. Perhaps that"
"was what she feared, his very calmness."
"“I must see Mrs. Moulton again,” remarked Kennedy, as we left."
"The Moultons lived, we found, in one of the largest suites of a new"
"apartment hotel, the Deluxe, and in spite of the fact that our arrival"
"had been announced some minutes before we saw Mrs. Moulton, it was"
evident that she had been crying hysterically over the loss of the
paste jewels and what it implied.
"“I missed it this morning, after my return from seeing you,” she"
"replied in answer to Craig’s inquiry, then added, wide-eyed with alarm,"
“What shall I do? He must have opened the wall safe and found the
replica. I don’t dare ask him point-blank.”
"the lawyer had drawn up from his dictation, and the more lengthy"
agreement between Sallie and Jasper Slyne.
"Slyne and Jobling added their names to that, and Slyne attached his"
careful signature to a promise to pay the solicitor the percentage
agreed upon. Captain Dove witnessed it and then called Sallie from her
"seat in the window-alcove, and she came forward with anxious eyes, to"
fulfil the undertaking she had finally had to give Jasper Slyne as the
price of his help in her most unhappy predicament.
She did not know--nor did she greatly care then--what was contained in
the contract he laid before her without a word. She took from him
without demur the pen he held out to her. She had promised to do all he
"told her and give him whatever he asked--except, for the present,"
herself.
"""Sign 'Josceline Justice' at the foot of each page,"" he said gently, and"
she did so without a word. For she would not for all the world contained
have broken any promise she had given. Then Mr. Jobling desired her to
witness the two other men's signatures.
As she handed him back the pen she had a final question to ask him.
"""You said my father and mother are both dead, and my step-brother too."
"Is there no one else--"""
"""No one you need worry about in the least,"" he assured her,"
"misunderstanding. ""There was a beggarly American who lodged a claim to"
"the title and--to the title; his name was Carthew, I think--yes, Justin"
Carthew. But even if I--if he hadn't gone and got lost while looking for
"you, his claim would be quite ineffectual now. You're your father's"
"daughter, Lady Josceline. Justin Carthew was a dozen or more degrees"
"experience!--most amusing, I assure you! and quite unique! Why--"" and"
"suddenly stopping short, she turned smartly round and gesticulated with"
"one hand ... ""I have interviewed all the favorite actors and actresses"
in London! The biggest brewers in Great Britain have received me at
"their country mansions, and have given me all the particulars of their"
lives from earliest childhood! The author of 'Hugger Mugger's Curse'
took the greatest pains to explain to me how he first collected the
"materials for his design. The author of that most popular story,"
"'Darling's Twins,' gave me a description of all the houses he has ever"
"lived in,--he even told me where he purchased his writing-paper, pens,"
and ink! And to think that a POET should be too grand to be
"interrogated! Oh, the idea is really very funny! ... quite too funny"
"for anything! ""She gave a short laugh,--then relapsing into severity,"
"she added ... ""You will, I hope, tell Mr. Alwyn I called?"""
"Villiers bowed. ""Assuredly!"""
"""Thank you! Because it is possible he may have different opinions to"
"yours,--in that case, if he writes me a line, fixing an appointment, I"
"shall be very pleased to call again. I will leave my card,--and if Mr."
"Alwyn is a sensible man, he will certainly hold broader ideas on the"
subject of 'interviewing' than YOU appear to entertain. You are QUITE
"sure I cannot see him?"""
"""Quite!""--There was no mistake about the firm emphasis of this reply."
"""Oh, very well!""--here she opened the door, rattling the handle with"
"rather an unnecessary violence,--""I'm sorry to have taken up any of"
"your time, Mr. Villiers. Good-morning!"""
"""Good-morning!"" ... returned Villiers calmly, touching the bell that"
his servant might be in readiness to show her out. But the baffled
"will reach our friend."""
"""Good, good! Come to my hotel. I will trust you."""
"We went to De Grammont's house, and after taking great precautions"
"against discovery, he gave me a small wooden box wound with yards of tape"
"and sealed with quantities of wax. I put the box in my pocket, saying:--"
"""I accept the trust on my honor, dear count, and though the package bears"
"no name nor address, I shall deliver it to the person for whom it is"
"intended."""
De Grammont said he knew nothing of the contents of the box except that
"it contained a message for a friend, and I believed him."
"When I left his house he came to the door with me, murmuring: ""My"
"gratitude! My gratitude! Also the gratitude of my king, which I hope may"
prove of far greater value to your friend than my poor offering of
"words."""
"I lost no time in seeking George, except to make sure that I was not"
followed. I trusted De Grammont and felt sure that the box he had given
me contained a personal communication from no less a person than Louis
"XIV of France, but I wanted to take no risk of betraying Hamilton by"
leading De Grammont or any one else to his hiding-place.
"Since Frances's providential escape, the king had suspected the right"
"persons of her rescue. At least he suspected Hamilton, and was seeking"
him more diligently than ever before. His Majesty had not shown me any
"mark of disfavor, but I feared he suspected me, and was sure he was not"
convinced that Frances's alibi had been proved by unsuborned testimony.
"If he was sure that she was the one who had been kidnapped, his"
"And from that day, a year and a half ago, there has been keen"
competition among the inhabitants of the dosshouse as to which can
"swear the hardest at the merchant.  And last night there was a ""slight"
"skirmish with hot words,"" as the Captain called it, between Petunikoff"
and himself.  Having dismissed the architect the merchant approached
the Captain.
"""What are you hatching?"" asked he, putting his hand to his cap, perhaps"
"to adjust it, perhaps as a salutation."
"""What are you plotting?"" answered the Captain in the same tone. He"
moved his chin so that his beard trembled a little; a non-exacting
person might have taken it for a bow; otherwise it only expressed the
desire of the Captain to move his pipe from one corner of his mouth to
"the other.  ""You see, having plenty of money, I can afford to sit"
"hatching it.  Money is a good thing, and I possess it,"" the Captain"
"chaffed the merchant, casting cunning glances at him.  ""It means that"
"you serve money, and not money you,"" went on Kuvalda, desiring at the"
same time to punch the merchant's belly.
"""Isn't it all the same?  Money makes life comfortable, but no money,"""
... and the merchant looked at the Captain with a feigned expression of
"suffering.  The other's upper lip curled, and exposed large, wolf-like"
teeth.
"""With brains and a conscience, it is possible to live without it. Men"
only acquire riches when they cease to listen to their conscience ...
"the less conscience the more money!"""
"""Just so; but then there are men who have neither money nor conscience."""
"""Nay,"" he said deliberately, ""I have been both judged and misjudged"
"myself, and it would ill become me in like manner to judge others. But"
"if that man is not of your country and my trade, Ramon Garcia has lived"
"in vain. That is all."""
Concha nodded a little uncertainly.
"""Yes,"" she said slowly, ""yes--of my country. I believe you. He has the"
Andalucian manner of wearing his clothes. If he were a girl he would
know how to tie a ribbon irregularly and how to place a bow-knot a
little to the side in the right place--things which only Andalucians
"know. But what in the world do you mean by 'of your profession'?"""
"El Sarria smoked a while in silence, inhaling the blue cigarette smoke"
"luxuriously, and causing it to issue from his nostrils white and"
moisture-laden with his breath. Then he spoke.
"""I mean of my late profession,"" he explained, smiling on Concha; ""it"
will not do for a man on the high-road to a commission to commit himself
"to the statement that he has practised as a bandit, or stopped a coach"
on the highway in the name of King Carlos Quinto that he might examine
"more at his ease the governmental mail bags. But our Sergeant--well, I"
am man-sworn and without honour if he hath not many a time taken
"blackmail without any such excuse!"""
Concha seemed to be considering deeply. Her pretty mouth was pursed up
"like a ripe strawberry, and her brows were knitted so fiercely that a"
deep line divided the delicately arched eyebrows.
"""And to this I can add somewhat,"" she began presently; ""they say (I know"
not with what truth) that I have some left-handed gipsy blood in me--and
"if that man be not a Gitano--why, then I have never seen one. Besides,"
"1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic"
matter they have been derived by slow change.
"2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either"
a porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.
"3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under"
"pressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them"
"from escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of"
"an ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS."
"4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In"
"these reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,"
reaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred
pounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a
"deafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In"
accounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has
been compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian
"water, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is"
not uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the
exhaustion of gas and oil.
LIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN
"During the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types"
"already present branched widely into new genera and species, and"
new and higher types appeared.
Sponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their
climax.
STROMATOPORA--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew
special interest in his spotless Lady Geraldine.
[Illustration: He stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the
fair Geraldine (page 155).]
"""I trow so,"" was the carelessly-spoken reply of Lord Sandford, as he"
adjusted his wig and suffered his valet to spray some delicate perfume
"over his person, as a finishing touch to his toilet.  ""The Lady"
Geraldine is no longer to lead the life of a nun.  It has been decreed
"that she is to show her lovely face abroad, and add thereby a lustre to"
"her mother’s charms."""
"""A lustre her ladyship would well dispense with,"" laughed another.  ""She"
would sooner pose as the stepmother than the mother of a grown-up
"daughter—ha, ha!  How comes it that this young beauty hath never been"
shown before to the world?  Other damsels make their _début_ at sixteen;
"but the Lady Geraldine can scarce be less than twenty, and has the"
"dignity of matronhood."""
"""A vast deal more dignity than the most part of our matrons do show"
"forth,"" spoke Lord Sandford incisively.  ""Doubtless she learned it from"
"her grandam, her mother’s mother and her father’s aunt; for my Lord and"
"my Lady Romaine are cousins, and Mrs. Adair was trusted and revered by"
"both.  Young children are in the way of such gay ladies of fashion,"
"wherefore the babe was sent to its grandam, and remained with her till"
"the virtuous and discreet old lady died, having bequeathed her store of"
"wisdom and discretion to the beautiful maid she had reared."""
"""And her fortune too,"" sniggered one gay dandy. ""Do not forget that"
"item, my lord.  It is whispered that it will make the biggest of her"
"charms.  What is the figure?  Doth anybody know?"""
damage done to her property.
The two women readily agreed. In the curtailment of their movements
and the absence of normal means of communication their life at Villa
Beau-séjour was belying its name. Their supply of money was coming
to an end; attempts must be made to regularize that position by
drawing on Mrs. Warren's German investments and the capital she
still had in Belgian stock--if that were negotiable at all.
Where should they go? Mrs. Warren still had some lien on the Hotel
"Édouard-Sept (the name, out of deference to the Germans, had been"
changed to Hotel Impérial). With the influence of the Government
Secretary behind her she might turn out some of its occupants and
"regain the use of the old ""appartement."" This would accommodate"
Vivie too. And there was no reason why their friend should not place
"his own lodging and office at the same hotel, which was situated"
conveniently on the Rue Royale not far from the Governor's residence
in the Rue de la Loi.
"So this plan was carried out. And in December, 1914, Mrs. Warren had"
"some brief flicker of happiness once more, and even Vivie felt the"
nightmare had lifted a little. It was life again. Residence at the
Villa Beau-séjour had almost seemed an entombment of the living.
"Here, in the heart of Brussels, at any rate, you got some news every"
"day, even if much of it was false. The food supply was more certain,"
"there were 700,000 people all about you. True, the streets were very"
badly lit at night and fuel was scarce and dear. But you were in
contact with people.
"In January, Vivie tried to get into touch with the American"
"Legation, not only to send news of their condition to England but to"
ascertain whether permission might not be obtained for them to leave
and appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too
diffident to aspire to Aileen’s notice; so he usually sat at one of
"Tildy’s tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled"
weakfish.
One day when Mr. Seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer.
There were only two or three customers in the restaurant. When Mr.
"Seeders had finished his weakfish he got up, put his arm around Tildy’s"
"waist, kissed her loudly and impudently, walked out upon the street,"
"snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry, and hied himself"
to play pennies in the slot machines at the Amusement Arcade.
For a few moments Tildy stood petrified. Then she was aware of Aileen
"shaking at her an arch forefinger, and saying:"
"“Why, Til, you naughty girl! Ain’t you getting to be awful, Miss"
Slyboots! First thing I know you’ll be stealing some of my fellows. I
"must keep an eye on you, my lady.”"
Another thing dawned upon Tildy’s recovering wits. In a moment she had
"advanced from a hopeless, lowly admirer to be an Eve-sister of the"
"potent Aileen. She herself was now a man-charmer, a mark for Cupid, a"
Sabine who must be coy when the Romans were at their banquet boards.
Man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable. The sudden
"and amatory Seeders had, as it were, performed for her a miraculous"
piece of one-day laundry work. He had taken the sackcloth of her
"uncomeliness, had washed, dried, starched and ironed it, and returned"
it to her sheer embroidered lawn—the robe of Venus herself.
The freckles on Tildy’s cheeks merged into a rosy flush. Now both Circe
and Psyche peeped from her brightened eyes. Not even Aileen herself had
been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant.
state's claim to the new plant and the benefits that would accrue
therefrom.
Crane droned on. The Vice-President of the United States looked down on
the top of Senator Crane's massive head and became fruitfully
preoccupied with thoughts of his own.
"Then, quite suddenly, the line of Crane's exposition changed. The"
Vice-President wasn't quite sure at what precise point this had come
about. He wasn't aware of the change until some very strange words
penetrated:
""" ... so, therefore, it has become starkly apparent that the American"
people have been denied the information which would have made them
"aware of their own deadly danger. Invasion from space is now imminent."""
"The Vice-President tensed. Had the stupid idiot gone mad? Or had he, the"
"Vice-President, been in a fog when vital, top-secret information had"
been made public?
"He banged the gavel down hard, for want of a better gesture, and was"
"grateful when a tall, dignified man with a look of deepest concern on"
his face rose from behind his desk out on the floor.
"""Will the Senator yield to his distinguished colleague from"
"Pennsylvania?"""
"Crane turned, scowling. ""I will yield to no man on matters of grave"
"import."" With that he turned and continued with his revelations. ""The"
people of this nation have been deprived of the knowledge that the
"invasion from space has already begun. A vanguard of hideous, half-human"
"creatures have even now achieved a beach-head on our planet. Even now,"
deferentially.
"""To Grosvenor Square now--and hurry along,"" he directed the driver in a"
voice his enemy could not fail to hear. And the taxicab swung into Drury
"Lane, on its way west."
"For a few minutes he sat silent, with bent head, biting at his"
moustache. Then he looked round at Sallie.
"""That fellow takes me for another man,"" he told her querulously. ""He's"
been dogging me ever since he first saw me at Monte Carlo. You've no
"idea, Sallie, what a dangerous risk I had to run there--for your sake."""
"""You haven't told me much about--anything, Jasper,"" she reminded him."
And he proceeded to describe in lurid detail the fate which would
undoubtedly have befallen him had M. Dubois been able then to fasten on
him responsibility for the misdeeds of that criminal whom he so
unfortunately resembled.
Sallie listened in silence. She had been wondering whether M. Dubois
could be in any way concerned with her affairs. She gathered that he was
interested only in Slyne. The latter's story of grave risk run for her
"sake fell somewhat flat, since it seemed to rest on the mere possibility"
of his having been mistaken for somebody else. She could scarcely
believe that his fear of M. Dubois had no other foundation. She even
ventured to suggest that he could easily have proved the detective in
the wrong.
"""He wouldn't have paid the slightest attention to anything I could say,"""
"Slyne assured her tartly. ""He wouldn't have asked any questions or"
listened to any statement of mine. You don't know anything about the
outrages that are committed every day by fellows like that on men like
But they were presently delivered from their difficulty by the newly
nominated commander-in-chief himself.
"""This scene is painful to me,"" said Señor Muñoz, placidly, ""it irritates"
my nerves. I have a headache. I think I shall retire and leave these
gentlemen to make such arrangements as may be necessary till the return
"of our guards, which will doubtless take place within an hour or so. If"
"you need me you can call for me!"""
Having made this general declaration he turned to Rollo and addressed
himself particularly to him.
"""My rooms, I would have you know, are in the north wing,"" he continued;"
"""I beg that there shall be no firing or other brutal noise on that"
"side. Anything of the kind would be most annoying. So pray see to it."""
"Then he advanced to where his wife stood, her eyes full of anger at this"
desertion.
"""My angel,"" he said, calmly, ""I advise you sincerely to do the same."
Retire to your chamber. Take a little _tisane_ for the cooling of the
"blood, and leave all other matters to these new friends of ours. I am"
sure they appear very honest gentlemen. But as you have many little
"valuables lying about, do not forget to lock your door, as I shall mine."
"Adieu, my angel!"""
And so from an inconceivable height of dandyism his Excellency the Duke
of Rianzares would have stooped to bestow a good night salutation on his
"wife's cheek, had not that lady, swiftly recovering from her stupor,"
"suddenly awarded him a resounding box on the ear, which so far"
discomposed the calm of his demeanour that he took from his pocket a
forward.
"“Stop!” he roared. “You young whelp, if you----”"
"He broke off with a gurgling sound, and the color left his face. With a"
"final swing, Bob loosened his hold on the bundle, which curved in a"
"perfect arc over the rear of the jam, over the jagged crest, and dropped"
swiftly out of sight amid the massive timbers upended in confusion along
the face and close to the spot where protruded the freshly driven spiles
which had caused all the trouble.
An instant later the whole throng of men hustled frantically for cover.
CHAPTER X. THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL
In less than sixty seconds--so close had been Bob’s calculations--came a
"detonation which shook the earth, making several of the running men"
"stagger and lose their stride. Up spurted a great mass of water,"
carrying with it massive logs leaping like agonized things alive. They
"fell back again, followed by a shower of débris mingled with fine spray,"
"which the wind sifted down on the heads of the ducking, dodging men."
"From his place behind a stump Bainbridge rose swiftly, shielding his"
face with one crooked arm from the rain of chips and splinters and bits
"of bark, and stared eagerly toward the jam. It took but a moment to see"
"that the spiles had disappeared, and the boom was shattered. Moreover,"
the key logs of the jam were so loosened that the whole drive was again
on its way downstream. Bob turned to Peters with a gesture of
satisfaction.
"“She’s off, Jack,” he said. “Get a wiggle on, now, and rush her along."
the Government regulations as to curricula. A good teacher was not
troubled by such matters.
"83,660. (Mr. Sly). There was no scope for the employment of non-Indians"
in the high schools as apart from the colleges. It was in the
professorial line that more help from the West was required.
"83,661. (Mr. Gokhale). The witness knew of three instances in which the"
colonies had secured distinguished men on salaries which were lower than
these given to officers of the Indian Educational Service. One was at
"Toronto, another was in New Zealand and the third at Yale university."
The salaries on the two latter cases were £600 and £500 a year. The same
held good as regards Japan. The facts there had been stated in a
"Government of India publication as follows: ""Subsequent to 1895 there"
"were 67 Professors recruited in Europe and America, of those, 20 came"
"from Germany, 16 from England and 16 from the United States. The average"
pay was £384. In the highest Imperial University the average pay is
"£684. As soon as Japanese could be found to do the work, even tolerably"
"well, the foreigner was dropped."""
"83,662. When the witness first started work in India, he found that"
"there was no physical laboratory, or any grant made for a practical"
experimental course. He had to construct instruments with the help of
"local mechanics, whom he had to train. All this took him ten years. He"
then undertook original investigation at his own expense. The Royal
Society became specially interested in his work and desired to give him
a Parliamentary grant for its continuation. It was after this that the
Government of Bengal came forward and offered him facilities for
research.
"83,663. In the Educational Service he would take men of achievement from"
anywhere; but men of promise he would take from his own country.
During this interview Rollo had stood absent-mindedly with his hand
"pressed on Concha's, as he listened to the strange speech of La Giralda."
Even his acquaintance with the language of the gipsies of Granada had
only enabled him to understand a word here and there. The girl's colour
"slowly returned, but the fear of the plague still ran like ice in her"
"veins. She who feared nothing else on earth, was shaken as with a palsy"
"by the terror of the Black Death, so paralysing was the fear that the"
very name of cholera laid upon insanitary Spain.
"""Well?"" said Rollo, turning to La Giralda, who stood considering with"
"her eyes upon the ground, after her interview with the crook-backed"
dwarf.
"""You must give me time to think,"" she said; ""this boy is one of our"
"people--a Gitano of Baza. He is not of this place, and he tells me"
strange things. He swears that the Queen and the court are plague-stayed
at La Granja by fear of the cholera. They dare not return to Madrid.
They cannot supply themselves with victuals where they are. The very
guards forsake them. And the Gitanos of the hills--but I have no right
"to tell that to the foreigner--the Gorgio. For am not I also a Gitana?"""
*       *       *       *       *
The village where Rollo's command first stumbled upon this dreadful fact
"was called Frias, in the district of La Perla, and lies upon the eastern"
"spurs of the Guadarrama. It was, therefore, likely enough then that the"
"boy spoke truth, and that within a few miles of them the Court of Spain"
was enduring privations in its aerial palace of La Granja.
But even when interrogated by El Sarria the old woman remained
obstinately silent as to the news concerning her kinsfolk which she had
circle of his own men. “Same gang who bought Schaeffer.”
"The jam boss nodded in a troubled way. “I’m afraid they’ve got us bad,"
"too. It’s goin’ to take one long time pickin’ that jam apart, but I"
can’t see anythin’ else to do. I spose I’d better start ’em at it right
"away, sir.”"
"“Not at all,” retorted Bob swiftly. “Do nothing of the kind. Let ’em"
"stay just where they are, Jerry!”"
At the sound of his imperative undertone Calker hustled up. There was a
"brief interchange of words between the trio, during which the faces of"
both lumberjacks brightened--amazingly. Then all three disappeared into
"the bushes a little way upstream, from which they did not emerge for a"
considerable time.
"When they finally appeared, Bainbridge held by his side a shapeless"
package of considerable size. Had not Peters and Calker walked so close
"beside him as he bent his way leisurely toward the crowd about the jam,"
it would probably have been noticed that this package was made up of a
"dozen or more sticks of giant powder fastened securely together, and"
depending from a sling of stout manila rope.
"The line of rivermen had turned, and were watching his approach with"
"interested curiosity, but Joyce and his gang could see nothing. Reaching"
"the men, Bob paused, struck a match, and carefully lighted the end of a"
"protruding fuse. As it sputtered up he gave a short, sharp word of"
"command, the line of men opened instantly to let him through, and a"
"second later he stood not a dozen paces from Joyce, deliberately"
swinging the deadly package round and round his head.
For a second there was a breathless hush. Then the red-haired man leaped
"With a choked, inarticulate outcry the duke snatched bow and arrow"
"from the nearest sentry, and ere the Pisan could grasp the meaning of"
"what he saw, or prevent, he set and sped the bolt. A moan died on the"
"stillness. A form collapsed, shuddered and lay still."
"The duke dropped bow and arrow, staring like a madman, then rushed"
towards the prostrate form.
"Bending over it, a moan broke from his lips, as he threw his arms"
"about the lifeless clay of her he had loved in the days of yore, ere"
the honeyed treachery of the Frangipani had sundered and broken their
lives. The woman of the Red Tower had expiated her guilt.
He saw at once that no human agency might here avail. Death had been
instantaneous. The arrow had pierced the heart.
"The duke knelt long by her side, and the strong man's frame heaved"
"with convulsive sobs, as he closed the eyes and muttered an Ave for"
her untimely departed soul.
"When he arose, he looked into the pale face of Francesco, whose"
blood-stained sword and garments told a tale his lips would not. He
"understood without a word. Silently he extended his hand to the duke,"
"then, taking off his own mantle, he covered therewith the woman's"
body.
It was midnight when the Pisans and the duke's men groped their way
cautiously down the steep winding path to the shore. The Pisans made
"for their ships and Spoleto's men for the dusk of their native woods,"
carrying on a hurriedly constructed bier the body of the woman of the
Red Tower.
"reward in the proverbial ""nice young man."""
"Mr. White agreed with her on every point but this. ""If she deserted"
that household it would fall! She's the only one that isn't like her
"father."""
"""Then she must find someone who'll take the family with her,"" Mrs."
White asserted determinedly. But having no godmother's fairy wand she
"had not been able, during the summer weeks, to bring the prince to"
Edgeacres; her husband's acquaintances were too bald and round to play
the part of princes.
Trude had not minded the dearth of young men. Since her unhappy
experience on a former visit she was glad of that dearth. The serenity
"of the summer, the relaxation and rest from responsibilities had"
"brought a lovely freshness to her face, a brightness to her eyes that"
was not all a reflection of the brightness about her. The sheer luxury
"of loafing, of not having to think out petty problems or worry one"
"single minute was all her old-young heart now asked. Once in awhile, of"
"course, she fretted because Isolde was not enjoying Edgeacres with her,"
or getting to know how really nice Aunt Edith White was. Where Vick and
"Sidney were concerned she had no remorse for Vick was seeing new lands,"
"doubtless conquering them, and Sidney was happy at Cape Cod; but she"
could not help thinking that Issy must be working too hard at the
Deerings--getting up early in the morning and typing all through the
hot day and doubtless fussing over the housework and the small babies
as well.
Trude thought of the mail. Again there had been no letter from either
Issy or Sidney! Sidney really _ought_ to write. Perhaps it _had_ not
been wise to let her go off alone with relatives of whom they knew
nothing!
horizon. Then he pointed with his holly staff to a blue hill that rose
against the eastern sky.
"""How far?"" queried Francesco."
The goatherd was anointing himself with spittle.
"""Each mile in these parts grows more evil,"" he said, tracing the sign"
"of the cross. ""It behooves a Christian to be circumspect!"""
Francesco prodded him with his scabbard.
"""How far?"""
"""Some ten leagues,"" replied the gnome. ""The day is clear, and the"
"place looks nearer than it is!"""
"It occurred to Francesco that there must be some human abode close by,"
"as the goatherd, entirely familiar with the region, would not wander"
too far from habitations of the living. And upon having made known his
"request, the little man preceded him at a lively pace. At a lodge in"
"the forest deeps they halted, and here Francesco and his guide rested"
"during the hot hours of noon, partaking of such food as the liberality"
"of their host, an old anchorite, set before them."
"After men and steed had rested, they set out anew."
"The goatherd's inclination to invoke untold saints, whenever there"
"seemed occasion and whenever there was not, was curbed by a hard line"
"round Francesco's lips, and they plunged into the great silence. A"
"sense of green mystery encompassed them, as they traversed the green"
forest-aisles. The sky seemed to have receded to a greater distance.
watches when they turned up the slope. They would have felt less
comfortable during the latter part of their journey if they had known
that they were passing within a few hundred yards of the headquarters of
the outlaws at the old mission.
After a time they came to what looked like a wrinkle in the face of the
"grand old mountain. They proceeded up this with no little caution, not"
knowing but enemies might be watching there. It was just such a place as
outlaws lurking for prey or cowering from officers would be apt to seek.
"The wrinkle, or gully, led almost to the snow line and finally ended in"
"a little dip which lay between two summits rising side by side, like"
jagged rows of teeth.
"“I’m half starved and half frozen!” Harry declared, as he rested for a"
"time in the depth of what had once been a mountain lake, but which had"
been drained by the gully. “If I ever get back in little old New York
"again, I’m going to get Dad to make me a gasoline buggy with a snout"
"nine feet long, and I’m going to push traffic aside on Broadway for the"
next thousand years.”
“How often have you said that?” laughed Jack.
"“Let’s see,” Frank put in, “this is the twelfth trip we boys have taken,"
"either in the interests of the Secret Service or on vacations, so this"
makes twelve times that Harry has promised never to leave New York again
once he gets back there.”
“That’s all right!” Harry grinned. “You fellows ain’t half so hungry as
I am or you wouldn’t feel so gay over it.”
"“Now, how far are we from camp?” asked Jack."
"purifying yourself from the lust of life, you will come unto that lake"
where all desire shall be washed away.
CHAPTER XX
'NOBLESSE OBLIGE'
"'Sooner shall the cleft rock reunite so as to make a whole, than"
may he who kills any living being be admitted into our
society.'--_Acceptance into the Monkhood._
It is very noticeable throughout the bazaars of Burma that all the beef
"butchers are natives of India. No Burman will kill a cow or a bullock,"
and no Burman will sell its meat. It is otherwise with pork and fowls.
Burmans may sometimes be found selling these; and fish are almost
"invariably sold by the wives of the fishermen. During the king's time,"
any man who was even found in possession of beef was liable to very
"severe punishment. The only exception, as I have explained elsewhere,"
"was in the case of the queen when expecting an addition to her family,"
"and it was necessary that she should be strengthened in all ways. None,"
"not even foreigners, were allowed to kill beef, and this law was very"
"stringently observed. Other flesh and fish might, as far as the law of"
"the country went, be sold with impunity. You could not be fined for"
"killing and eating goats, or fowls, or pigs, and these were sold"
"occasionally. It is now ten years since King Thibaw was overthrown, and"
"there is now no law against the sale of beef. And yet, as I have said,"
no respectable Burman will even now kill or sell beef. The law was
"founded on the beliefs of the people, and though the law is dead, the"
trace of her did he find. But what he did discover solved the mystery
of the grewsome feast of death which he had just witnessed. In a
"corner where he had dropped it, there lay a silken banderol belonging"
"to a man-at-arms of Anjou's Provencals. They had been here, and the"
"nuns, to escape the violation of their bodies, had died, thus cheating"
the fiends out of the gratification of their lusts.
The terrible discovery unnerved Francesco so completely that for a
"time he stood as if turned to stone, looking about him like a"
traveller who has stumbled blindly into a charnel house. Urged by
"manifold forebodings, he then rushed from room to room, from cell to"
cell. The same silence met him everywhere. Of Ilaria he found not a
"trace. Had the fiends of Anjou carried her away, or had she, in"
"endeavoring to escape, found her death outside of the walls of San"
Nicandro?
He dared not think out the thought.
"The shadows of the place, the staring faces, the stiff hands clawing"
"at things inanimate, were like the phantasms of the night. Francesco"
took the sea-air into his nostrils and looked up into the blue
radiance of the sky. All about him the garden glistened in the dawn;
the cypresses shimmered with dew. The late roses made very death more
apparent to his soul.
"As he stood in deep thought, half dreading what he but half knew, a"
"voice called to him, breaking suddenly the ponderous silence of the"
"place. Guided by its sound, Francesco unlatched the door and found"
himself face to face with the Duke of Spoleto.
For a moment they faced each other in silence.
opportunity of trying those boots. Meanwhile he used to talk about
"them at meals, and he would polish them up every night before he went"
to bed.  When the great day came for the first trial of them to be
"made, he took a patronising farewell of his wife and family, ignored"
"the many eager noses pressed against the upper windows of the Palace,"
"and sailed off.  The motion, as perhaps you know, is a little"
"disquieting at first, but one soon gets used to it.  After that it is"
fascinating. He had gone some two thousand miles before he realised
that there might be a difficulty about finding his way back.  The
difficulty proved at least as great as he had anticipated. For the
rest of that day he toured backwards and forwards across the country;
and it was by the merest accident that a very angry King shot in
through an open pantry window in the early hours of the morning.  He
removed his boots and went softly to bed. . . .
"It was, of course, a lesson to him.  He decided that in the future he"
"must proceed by a recognised route, sailing lightly from landmark to"
landmark.  Such a route his Geographers prepared for him--an early
"morning constitutional, of three hundred miles or so, to be taken ten"
times before breakfast.  He gave himself a week in which to recover
his nerve and then started out on the first of them.

"Now the Kingdom of Euralia adjoined that of Barodia, but whereas"
"Barodia was a flat country, Euralia was a land of hills.  It was"
"natural then that the Court Geographers, in search of landmarks,"
"should have looked towards Euralia; and over Euralia accordingly,"
"about the time when cottage and castle alike were breakfasting, the"
King of Barodia soared and dipped and soared and dipped again.

"peculiar conditions of this particular drive, and before Bainbridge"
realized it he had given a brief narrative of his fight with the Lumber
Trust and the events which had grown out of it.
"“You interest me extraordinarily, Mr. Bainbridge,” the older man said,"
"in his crisp, decisive way, when at last they paused at the point"
"several miles below the scene of the last jam, where Sears had to branch"
"off to reach his camp. “Things of this sort always do, for it’s only"
those one has to struggle for which are really worth while. You’ve
"certainly had to fight hard in this case, but you’ve practically won"
"out, haven’t you? After this last fracas I shouldn’t suppose there’d be"
much chance for further interference.”
Bob shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. “You sadly underestimate
"the power of the trust, Mr. Sears. I shan’t be beyond the chance of"
"interference until the drive is safe in our mill booms at Lancaster, and"
even then it wouldn’t surprise me if they’d try to work some dirty
trick.”
Sears frowned indignantly; then his face brightened.
“In spite of everything I think I should bet on you.” he chuckled.
“There’s a certain vigor in your method of dealing with these people
"which makes for success. I really believe you’ll win, Mr. Bainbridge,"
"and I surely hope so. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, and I"
"trust one to be repeated. I shall be hereabouts for some time yet, and"
may run across you before I leave.”
"Bob warmly reciprocated his feeling, and, after a hearty handshake,"
"turned south along the river, while Sears disappeared in the undergrowth"
to the westward.
Madame Gilbert the stranger stared openly at her cheek and ear and the
"coils of bright copper hair. Madame knew that he was watching her, and"
"rather liked the scrutiny. She had recognized him at once, and would"
have been slightly humiliated if he had failed to be interested in her.
"It is true that she had met him but once before in her life, and that"
"some four years since, but as Madame had condescended to recollect"
him--I have said that her memory for faces was royal--a failure on his
part to remember her would have been an offence unpardonable.
"Madame continued to munch sweet stuff, and the man, his tea completed,"
"rose, paid his bill, and then passed slowly in front of her. He needed"
"encouragement before he would speak. So Madame gave it, a quick look and"
a smile of invitation. He bowed.
"""Have I not the honour to meet again the Signora Guilberti?"" said he."
"""The Signora Guilberti,"" assented Madame, ""or Madame Guilbert, or Madame"
"Gilbert, as rendered by the rough English tongue. I have stooped to"
"anglicise my name,"" she went on, ""though I hate the clipped English"
"version."" She indicated a chair, and the lawyer--he was a lawyer--sat"
down.
"""Is it possible that Madame honours me with remembrance?"""
"""Let me place you,"" said she, happy in the display of her"
"accomplishments, ""and don't seek to guide my memory. It was in the"
"Spring of 1915, at a reception in the garden of Devonshire House. You"
were in attendance upon Her Majesty the Queen-Mother of Portugal. There
"were present representatives of the Italian Red Cross, for Italy, the"
"land of my late husband, had ranged herself with the Allies. You are a"
"lawyer of the _haute noblesse_. Your clients are peers and princes, of"
old princes in exile and of new peers in possession. I recall you most
"obvious reluctance, glancing out of his little oblique eyes at the young"
colonel.
Rollo considered a while before answering.
"""It is my opinion that the fewer men concerned in such a venture the"
"greater the chances of success,"" he said at last; ""furnish me with one"
petty officer intimately acquainted with the country between Zaragoza
"and San Ildefonso, and I will ask no more."""
Cabrera drew a long breath and looked at the young man with infinitely
more approval than he had before manifested.
"""You are right,"" he said, ""three times right! If you fail, there are"
fewer to go to the gallows. In prison fewer ill-sewn wine-skins to leak
"information. If you succeed, there are also fewer to divide the credit"
"and the reward. For my own part, I do not think you will succeed, but I"
will provide you with the best man in my command for your purpose and in
"addition heartily wish you well out of your adventure!"""
Cabrera was indeed immensely relieved to find the desires of our hero so
moderate. He had been directed to supply him with whatever force he
"required, and he expected to be deprived of a regiment at least, at a"
most critical time in the affairs of the Absolute King.
"""Young man,"" he said, ""you will certainly be shot or hanged before you"
are a month older. Nevertheless in the mean time I would desire to have
"the honour of shaking you by the hand. If you were not to die so soon,"
undoubtedly you would go far! It is a pity. And the Cristinos are bad
shots. They will not do the job half as creditably as my fellows would
"have done it for you this morning!"""
"If the transients were entranced by the fascinating Aileen, the"
regulars were her adorers. There was much rivalry among many of the
steady customers. Aileen could have had an engagement every evening. At
least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance. One
stout gentleman whom she and Tildy had privately christened “The Hog”
"presented her with a turquoise ring. Another one known as “Freshy,” who"
"rode on the Traction Company’s repair wagon, was going to give her a"
poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the Ninth.
And the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a
stock broker asked her to go to “Parsifal” with him.
"“I don’t know where this place is,” said Aileen while talking it over"
"with Tildy, “but the wedding-ring’s got to be on before I put a stitch"
"into a travelling dress—ain’t that right? Well, I guess!”"
"But, Tildy!"
"In steaming, chattering, cabbage-scented Bogle’s there was almost a"
"heart tragedy. Tildy with the blunt nose, the hay-coloured hair, the"
"freckled skin, the bag-o’-meal figure, had never had an admirer. Not a"
man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the
restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast-hunger for
food. None of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of
"wit. None of them loudly “jollied” her of mornings as they did Aileen,"
"accusing her, when the eggs were slow in coming, of late hours in the"
company of envied swains. No one had ever given her a turquoise ring or
"invited her upon a voyage to mysterious, distant “Parsifal.”"
"Tildy was a good waitress, and the men tolerated her. They who sat at"
her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare;
and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured
"Eilert's house, they looked at their watches and swore because so many"
minutes were being wasted. Where the devil was the car? The populace
"followed at some distance, gazing with reverence on these dressed-up"
fools.
I remember a couple of them: an old man--the one with the loud voice--who
wore a pleated kilt on each thigh and a jacket of green canvas with braid
"and buckles and straps and innumerable pockets all over it. What a man,"
"what a power! His beard, streaming out from under his nose like the"
"northern lights, was greenish-white, and he swore like a madman. Another"
"of the party was tall and bent, a flagpole of sorts, astonishing,"
"stupendous, with sloping shoulders, a tiny cap perched above extravagantly"
"arched eyebrows; he was an upended Roman battering ram, a man on stilts. I"
"measured him with my eyes, and still there was something left over. Yet he"
"was bent and broken, old before his time, quite bald; but his mouth was"
"tight as a tiger's, and he had a madness in his head that kept him on the"
move.
"""Stordalen!"" he cried."
England will soon have to open old people's homes for her sons. She
desexes her people with sport and obsessive ideas: were not other
"countries keeping her in perpetual unrest, she would in a couple of"
generations be converted to pederasty....
"Then the horn of the car was heard tooting in the woods, and everyone"
raced to meet it.
Of course Olaus's two boys had done an honest day's work in meeting the
"car so far up the road, and urging the driver to hurry; were they not to"
"get any reward? True, they were allowed to sit in the back seat for their"
return journey and thus enjoyed the drive of a lifetime; but money! They
"They were bound hand and foot. At a piping cry from the leader,"
several of the gangling figures picked them up in reedy arms and began
"to walk across the square, away from the ship. Brand noticed that his"
bearers' arms trembled with his weight: and sensed the flabbiness of
the substance that took the place in them of good solid muscle.
Physically these things were soft and ineffectual indeed. They had
only the ominous tubes with which to fight.
"The eery procession, with the bound Earthmen carried in the lead,"
wound toward a great building fringing the square. In through the high
"arched entrance of this building they went, and up a sloping incline"
"to its tower-top. Here, in a huge bare room, the two were"
unceremoniously dumped to the floor.
"While three of the things stood guard with the mysterious tubes,"
"another unbound them. A whole shower of high pitched, piping syllables"
"was hurled at them, speech which sounded threatening and contemptuous"
"but was otherwise, of course, entirely unintelligible, and then the"
"creatures withdrew. The heavy metal door was slammed shut, and they"
were alone.
"Brand drew a long breath, and began to feel himself all over for"
broken bones. He found none; he was still nerve-wracked from that last
"terrific shock, but otherwise whole and well."
"""Are you hurt, Dex?"" he asked solicitously."
"""I guess not,"" replied Dex, getting uncertainly to his feet. ""And I'm"
wondering why. It seems to me the brutes were uncommonly considerate
"of us--and I'm betting the reason is one we won't like!"""
"Brand shrugged. ""I guess we'll find out their intentions soon enough."
I expect he will come back to us occasionally to see what he looks like.
"The egregious O’Myre also hath descended on London town--stays,"
"however, but a little while----"
"Yet a wondrous thing of a man, the O’Myre--the most consistent surely"
of all created things--always wrong. He and _The Times_. He must have
"been suckled on half-truths, and nurtured on the Irish Bull; he now"
"browses on false conclusions. But with what an air! Nevertheless, he"
has it all on the most philosophic basis--has for ever been blaming
something for his lack of greatness. It now appears the English drama
is dead. The O’Myre will breathe new life into it.
"Meanwhile, he has laid it down, like a minor god with a throaty tenor"
"voice, that scenery destroys the illusion of the drama--therefore it"
comes about to-day that if you would be in the vogue with the ladies
"you must go in state not to the play, but to the dress rehearsal--the"
"bare theatre and the dinginess being alone at back, the low tone"
and the cobwebs and the like giving mystery to the spoken word that
requires for enunciation but beautiful lips. God! how the ducks quack!
"Thus mews he much monstrous wisdom, sitting like a pale emotional"
maggot upon the apple of discord that is called the modern drama.”...
The rest of the letter is a matter of affection and goodwill. A man
"is always ridiculous about his first-born--exaggerative, egotistical."
"As though he had invented the business. Whereas, like heredity,"
"immortality, and the latest fashion, it is thrust upon us."

"""'Surely the lady is not La Belle Jennings?' asked the king."
"""'Yes,' I replied."
"""'In that case you are the very man I want, and your lady-love can help"
"me buy Dunkirk. It is easy to lead a fool to do the wrong thing, and I'm"
"sure La Belle Jennings will find a way to gain her end and ours. If,"
"through her, you induce King Charles to sell Dunkirk to me on my own"
"terms, I'll make you its governor and a rich man. I'll put you in a"
"position to marry this paragon, Mam'selle Jennings, if, as I take it,"
lack of fortune is all that stands between you. I do not mind telling you
now that De Grammont had given me full information concerning the king's
view of La Belle Jennings and your relations to her before I wrote my
"first letter, inviting you to visit me.'"
"""I am loath to undertake so mean an office as that of inducing King"
"Charles to sell an English city, but I cannot save Dunkirk, and I may"
profit by helping what I cannot prevent. So I beg you broach the subject

nights of the working week. The costumes were to be provided by the
"managers, but were to be the property of the actors, who would undertake"

"When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, and certain other"
"details arranged, the great men took their leave in high good humour;"
"and the Old Lion, shaking back his mane of shaggy hair, grasped Grey by"
"the hands, his eyes sparkling in his head."

[Sidenote: Pisa's Four Monuments.]
The four chief objects of interest at Pisa are all in a group at the
"northern end of the town, and a wonderfully effective group it is: the"
"cloistered cemetery, or Camp Santo, with its fifty-five shiploads of"
"earth from the Holy Land; the Baptistery, with its remarkable echo;"
"the Cathedral, with the pendent lamp in the nave which suggested to"
"Galileo the idea of the pendulum; and that wonder of the world, the"
"white marble Tower, which leans thirteen feet out of the perpendicular."
agitation which had by that time attained its end. So when Vivie had
come out of prison and had promised to write to all the wardresses
and to meet them some day on non-professional ground; had found
Rossiter waiting for her in his motor and Honoria in hers; had
"thanked them both for their never-to-be-forgotten kindness, and had"
insisted on walking away in her rather creased and rumpled clothes
of the previous year with Bertie Adams; she sought the hospitality
"of Praddy at Hans Place. The parlour-maid received her sumptuously,"
and Praddy's eyes watered with senile tears.
"But Vivie would have no melancholy. ""Oh Praddy! If you only knew."
It's worth going to prison to know the joy of coming out of it! I'm
so happy at thinking this is my last day in England for ever so
"long. When the War is over, I think I shall settle in Switzerland"
"with mother--or perhaps all three of us--you with us, I mean--in"
Italy. We'll only come back here when the Women have got the Vote.
Now to-night you shall take me to the theatre--or rather I'll take
"_you_. I've thought it all out beforehand, and Bertie Adams has"
"secured the seats. It's _The Chocolate Soldier_ at the Adelphi, the"
only war piece they had ready; there are two stalls for us and
Bertie and his wife are going to the Dress Circle. My Cook's ticket
"is taken for Brussels and I leave to-morrow by the Ostende route."""
"""To-morrow"" was the 12th of August, and Dora was not yet in being to"
interpose every possible obstacle in the way of the civilian
"traveller. Down to the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, very"
"little difficulty was made about crossing the Channel, especially"
off the main Dover-Calais route.
So in the radiant noon of that August day Vivie looked her last on
"the brown-white promontories, cliffs and grey castle of Dover,"
"scarcely troubling about any anticipations one way or the other, and"
have been not a whit more perplexed at the prospect. As for John he had
the sensation of living in a fantastic dream. A child of six would have
"been a more practical ally. In the course of befogged conversation,"
"however, it was arranged that Miss Lindon should transfer to the new"
"house her worldly belongings, of which she was to give him an inventory,"
"including Dandy and Dickie and her maid Phoebe, a most respectable"
"girl of Baptist upbringing, who had been cruelly jilted by a prosperous"
"undertaker in the neighborhood, whom, if you had seen him conducting a"
"funeral, you would have thought as serious and God-fearing a man as the"
"clergyman himself; which showed how hypocritical men could be, and how"
"you ought never to trust to appearances. It was also settled that, as"
soon as Unity could be rescued from the guardianship of the orphanage
authorities and comfortably installed in a convalescent home by the
"seaside, Miss Lindon would journey thither in order to make her ward's"
acquaintance. In the meanwhile John would go house-hunting.
"“Walter Herold will help me,” said John."
"“That's your friend who acts, is n't it?” said Miss Lindon. “I have n't"
"any objection to theatres myself. In fact, I often used to go to see"
Irving when I was young. You meet quite a nice class of people in the
dress-circle. But I don't think ladies ought to go on the stage. I hope
Mr. Herold won't put such an idea into Unity's head.”
"“I don't think he will,” said John."
“Young girls are sometimes so flighty. My old friend Mrs. Willcox had
"a daughter who went on the stage, and she married an actor, and now has"
"twelve children, and lives in Cheshire. I was hearing about her only the"
other day. I suppose Unity will have to be taught music and drawing and
French like any other young lady.”
been thrown together at random. Then he nodded sagely twice and passed
on his way.
The glen continued to narrow overhead. The sunshine was entirely shut
out. The jaws of the precipice closed in upon the wayfarer as if to
"crush him, but Sergeant Cardono advanced with the steady stride of a"
"mountaineer, and the aplomb of one who is entirely sure of his"
reception.
The mountain silence grew stiller all about. None had passed that way
(so it seemed) since the beginning of time. None would repass till time
should be no more.
"Suddenly through the utter quiet there rang out, repeated and"
"reduplicated, the loud report of a rifle. The hills gave back the"
challenge. A moment before the dingy bedrabbled snow at Cardono's feet
"had been puffed upwards in a white jet, yet he neither stopped for this"
"nor took the least notice. Loyal or disloyal, true or false, he was a"
brave man this Sergeant Cardono. I dare say that any one close to him
might have discerned his beady eyes glitter and glance quickly from side
"to side, but his countenance was turned steadfastly as ever upon the"
snow at his feet.
Again came the same startling challenge out of the vague emptiness of
"space, the bullet apparently bursting like a bomb among the snow. And"
again Cardono took as much notice as if some half-dozen of village
loungers had been playing ball among the trees.
Only when a third time the _whisk_ of the bullet in the snow a yard or
"two to the right preceded the sound of the shot, Cardono shook his head"
"and muttered, ""Too long range! The fools ought to be better taught than"
"that!"" Then he continued his tramp steadily, neither looking to the"
"command console, which was preset for each flight and then monitored"
from the cockpit.
Now where's the damned on-board AI module?
He scanned the bay. The AI system was the key to his plan. He had to
make certain the computer's artificial intelligence functions could be
"completely shut down, disengaged, when the crucial moment came. He"
couldn't afford for the on-board system-override to abort his planned
revision in the hypersonic flight plan. His job tonight was to make
"sure all the surprises were his, not somebody else's. There wouldn't be"
any margin for screw-ups. Everything had to go like clockwork.
"He edged his way on through the freezing bay, searching the banks of"
"equipment for a clue, and then he saw what he was looking for. There,"
"along the portside bulkhead. It was a white, rectangular console, and"
everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted.
"He studied it a second, trying to decide where to begin."
At that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly how he'd
ever gotten into this crazy situation. Maybe he should have quit the
Air Force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had
"wanted. Right now, he had to admit, a little electrical engineering"
would definitely come in handy.
He took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing the AI
"console's faceplate, a bronzed rectangle. Eight screws later, he lifted"
it off and settled it on the floor.
The penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat sections of
plastic-coated wires. Somewhere in this electronic ganglia there had to
"plucked within him that hadn't been sounded for decades, the dark and"
"shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense,"
"although his reason rejected it, he felt he stood face to face with"
"the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet"
infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape
the scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivered.

The grizzled general--there was also one who was gray--was thinking
that this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and
usually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his
ire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent
"than himself. And always orders of the ""Tell me how to kill that man"""
"rather than the ""Kill that man"" sort. The distinction bothered him"
obscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls
"which made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's"
right-minded leaders--even the Thinkers weren't certain which.
"The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a"
"more turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and"
the dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.
He asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation
be in metal rather than flesh?
The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such
pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success
"with Buddhism. Sitting before his _guru_, his teacher, feeling the"
"Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had"
felt a little like this.
"The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,"
"multifariousness is at hand. Hasten the day, and save us from"
proletarian homogeneity and khaki all-alikeness.
"I love my indomitable coarse men from mountain Sardinia, for their"
"stocking-caps and their splendid, animal-bright stupidity. If only the"
"last wave of all-alikeness won't wash those superb crests, those caps,"
away.
And it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there;
"they were the women of the village, and the girls of her own age. But"
the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all.
"He made his way down to Melbustad in flying leaps, and howled and barked"
"in the most lamentable manner, and gave the people no rest until they"
"followed him. The young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun,"
"and climbed the hills; and when he drew near, there stood a number of"
"horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He crept up to the hut,"
"looked through a loop-hole in the wall, and saw a whole company sitting"
"together inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls, the people"
"from underground, and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof. At"
"that moment the doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn, one"
"larger than the other, came shooting out about his legs. When he went"
"in, there sat the maiden in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing"
"but the ring on her little finger, then all would have been complete."
"""In heaven's name, what has happened here?"" he asked, as he looked"
"around. All the silverware was still on the table, but all the tasty"
"dishes had turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads and the"
like.
"""What does it all mean?"" said he. ""You are sitting here in all your"
"glory, just like a bride?"""
in his repertory.
"""Oh, come, old chap, I bet he didn't,"" observed Captain Heseltine."
"""We've seen him, you know."""
Duncombe laughed good-humouredly.
"""At any rate he made Kilshaw look a little green, and some of the people"
behind called out 'Shame!' and got themselves sat upon. Then they had
Medland up again and twisted him a bit about his acquaintance with
"Gaspard; but the coroner didn't seem to think there was anything in it,"
"and they found murder against Gaspard, and rang down the curtain. And"
when we got outside there was a bit of a rumpus. They hooted Kilshaw and
"cheered Medland, and yelled like mad when a dashed pretty girl drove up"
"in a pony-cart and carried him off. Altogether it wasn't half bad."""
"""Glad you enjoyed yourself,"" observed Captain Heseltine. ""If it amuses"
strangers to see our leading celebrities mixed up in a murder and other
"distressing affairs, it's the least we can do to see that they get it."""
The Captain's facetiousness fell on unappreciative ears. Most of Mr.
Duncombe's audience were too alive to the serious side of the matter to
enjoy it. To them it was another and a very striking scene in the fight
"which had long gone on between Medland and Kilshaw, and had taken a"
fresh and fiercer impetus from the well-remembered day when Medland had
spoken his words about Kilshaw and his race-horses. Nobody doubted that
"Kilshaw had kept this man Benyon, or Benham, as a secret weapon, and"
that the murder had only made the disclosure come earlier. Kilshaw's
"reputation suffered somewhat in the minds of the scrupulous, but his"
"partisans would hear of no condemnation. They said, as he had said, that"
in dealing with a man like Medland it would have been folly not to use
"the weapons fate, or the foe himself by his own misdeeds, offered. As"
“If it is a sin--don’t you love me enough to sin a little for my sake?”
"“Not that sin,” he said."
Yvonne lifted her shoulders helplessly.
"“I would commit any sin for your sake,” she said. “It would seem so"
easy.”
"Curiously assorted as they were, a poetic idealism on the one side and"
grateful veneration on the other had hitherto bound them together. Now
they were sundered leagues apart; mutual understanding was hopeless.
Each was bewildered by the other’s moral attitude.
"The logical consequences of the discovery, that appeared so luridly"
"devious to the Canon’s intellect, failed entirely to appeal to Yvonne."
She referred them entirely to his personal inclinations. On the other
"hand, the Canon had a false insight into her soul that was a chilling"
disillusion.
The beauty of her exquisite purity and innocence had always captivated
in him the finer man. It was a mirage. It was gone. Emptiness remained.
"She was simply a graceful, non-moral being--a spiritual anomaly."
"Yvonne shivered, and rising, walked unsteadily to the wardrobe, whence"
"she took a dressing-jacket. Putting it on, she returned to the couch. It"
"was almost dark. The Canon watched her dim, slight figure as it passed"
"him, with a strange feeling of remoteness. A hundred trivial instances"
of her want of moral sense crowded into his mind to support his
"view--her inability to see the wrong-doing of Stephen, her indefinite"
"notions in religious matters, her mental attitude toward the girl that"
"had gone astray, of whom she had been talking only the night before, her"
former showing his delight in a rare display of white teeth and a flow
"of unintelligible English. Even the sledge-dogs, now fat from idleness,"
"greeted their mistress with a fierce clamor that dismayed Alton Clyde,"
to whom all was utterly new and strange.
"""Glory be!"" he exclaimed. ""They're nothing but wolves. Won't they bite?"
"And the house--ain't it a hit! Why, it looks like a stage setting! Oh,"
"say, I'm for this! I'm getting rough and primitive and brutal already!"""
"When they passed from the store, with its shelves sadly naked now, to"
"the cozy living quarters behind, his enthusiasm knew no bounds. Leaving"
"Chakawana and her mistress to chatter and clack in their patois, he"
"inspected the premises inside and out, peering into all sorts of"
"corners, collecting souvenirs, and making friends with the saturnine"
breed.
"Cherry would not return to the ship, but Emerson and Clyde re-embarked"
"and were rowed down to the cannery site, abreast of which lay _The"
"Bedford Castle_, where they lingered until the creeping twilight forced"
them to the boat again. When they reached the ship the cool Arctic
"night had descended, but its quiet was broken by the halting nimble of"
"steam-winches, the creak of tackle, the cries of men, and the sounds of"
a great activity. Baring his head to the breezes Boyd filled his lungs
"full of the bracing air, sweet with the flavor of spring, vowing"
secretly that no music that he had ever heard was the equal of this. He
"turned his face to the southward and smiled, while his thoughts sped a"
message of love and hope into the darkness.
"though I am not abroad. But perhaps I am abroad after all, far away from"
the soil where I have my roots.
"Why, indeed, do I stay here any longer, at a resort full of"
"schoolmistresses, with a host who has once more said farewell to sobriety?"
Nothing is happening to me; I do not grow here. The others go out and lie
"on their backs; I steal off and find relish in myself, and feel poetry"
"within me for the night. The world wants no, poetry; it wants only verses"
that have not been sung before.
"And Norway wants no red-hot irons; only village smiths forge irons now,"
for the needs of the mob and the honor of the country.
No one came; the stream of tourists went up and down Stordalen and left
our little Reisa valley deserted. If only the Northern Railway could have
come to Reisa with Cook's and Bennett's tours--then Stordalen in its turn
"would have lain deserted. Meanwhile, the cotters who are cultivating the"
soil will probably go on harvesting half the crop of the outlying fields
for the rest of time. There is every reason to think so--unless our
"descendants are more intelligent than we, and refuse to be smitten with"
the demoralizing effects of the tourist traffic.
"Now, my friend, you mustn't believe me; this is the point where you must"
"shake your head. There is a professor scuttling about the country, a born"
mediocrity with a little school knowledge about history; you had better
"ask him. He'll give you just as much mediocre information, my friend, as"
your vision can grasp and your brain endure.

Hardly had Manufacturer Brede left when Paul began to live a most
irregular life again. More and more all roads were closed to him; he saw
I did not like to say before my lady what I thought--that the
"Waldgrave was not quite himself, nor to be depended upon; and instead"
I proposed to go forward on foot and learn if anything was amiss. The
"road ran straight down the hill, and the party could scarcely pass me,"
"even in the gloom. If I found all well, I would whistle, and they"
could come on.
"My lady agreed, and, leaving them halted, I started cautiously down"
the hill. The darkness was not extreme; the cloud drift was broken
"here and there, and showed light patches of sky between; I could make"
"out the shapes of things, and more than once took a clump of bushes"
"for a lurking ambush. But halfway down, a line of poplars began to"
"shadow the road on our side, and from that point I might have walked"
"into a regiment and never seen a man. This, the being suddenly alone,"
"and the constant rustling of the leaves overhead, which moved with the"
"slightest air, shook my nerves, and I went very warily, with my heart"
in my mouth and a cry trembling on my lips.
Still I had reached the hillfoot before anything happened. Then I
"stopped abruptly, hearing quite distinctly in front of me the sound of"
footsteps. It was impossible that this could be the sound that the
"Waldgrave had heard, for only one man seemed to be stirring, and he"
"moved stealthily; but I crouched down and listened, and in a moment I"
was rewarded. A dark figure came out of the densest of the shadow and
"stood in the middle of the road. I sank lower, noiselessly. The man"
seemed to be listening.
It flashed into my head that he was a sentry; and I thought how
fortunate it was that I had come on alone.
"Presently he moved again. He stole along the track towards me,"
where a girl is weaving ceaselessly. All these sounds come into the
"house as if there were no walls at all, but they are unheeded from long"
custom.
The man lies on a low bed with a fine mat spread under him for bedding.
"His wife, his grown-up children, his sister, his brother are about him,"
"for the time is short, and death comes very quickly in the East. They"
"talk to him kindly and lovingly, but they read to him no sacred books;"
they give him no messages from the world to which he is bound; they
whisper to him no hopes of heaven. He is tortured with no fears of
"everlasting hell. Yet life is sweet and death is bitter, and it is hard"
to go; and as he tosses to and fro in his fever there comes in to him an
"old friend, the headman of the village perhaps, with a white muslin"
"fillet bound about his kind old head, and he sits beside the dying man"
and speaks to him.
"'Remember,' he says slowly and clearly, 'all those things that you have"
done well. Think of your good deeds.'
"And as the sick man turns wearily, trying to move his thoughts as he is"
"bidden, trying to direct the wheels of memory, the old man helps him to"
remember.
"'Think,' he says, 'of your good deeds, of how you have given charity to"
"the monks, of how you have fed the poor. Remember how you worked and"
saved to build the little rest-house in the forest where the traveller
"stays and finds water for his thirst. All these are pleasant things, and"
"men will always be grateful to you. Remember your brother, how you"
"helped him in his need, how you fed him and went security for him till"
"he was able again to secure his own living. You did well to him, surely"
that is a pleasant thing.'
They were now in the midst of the great wilderness. On all sides
"myriads of trees, interminably pillared; through their tops the wind"
sighed and pined like the soft breath of a sleeping world. Away on
"every hand stretched oblivious vistas, black under multitudinous green"
spires.
"The interminable trees seemed to vex the duke's spirit, as their"
trunks crowded the winding track and seemed to shut in the twain as
"with a never ending barrier. And behind them, with the muffled tread"
"of a phantom army, came the duke's armed array striding through the"
night.
"""Have you too suffered a wrong at the hands of the Frangipani?"""
"Francesco at last broke the silence, turning to his companion."
The latter jerked the bridle of his charger so viciously that the
terrified animal reared on its haunches and neighed in protest.
"""Man, know you whereof you speak?"" the duke snarled, as he came closer"
"to Francesco. ""He has made the one woman the Duke of Spoleto ever"
"loved--a wanton!""--"
They pushed uphill through the solemn shadows of the forest. A sound
like the raging of a wind through a wood came down to them faintly
"from afar. It was a sullen sound, deep and mysterious as the hoarse"
"babel of the sea, smitten through with the shrill scream of trumpets,"
like the cry of gulls above a storm. Yet in the aisles of the pine
forest it was still as death.
"Then, like a spark struck from flint and steel falling upon tinder, a"
red glare blazed out against the background of the night. A horn
"blared across the moorlands; the castle bell began to ring, jerkily,"
"determining to get on, but uneasy at the expense, for monetary conditions"
"were ever more embarrassed. At home, she practised steadily and worked"
hard at composition. She finished several songs and studies during the
"spring and summer, and left still more unfinished.  Monsieur Harmost was"
"tolerant of these efforts, seeming to know that harsh criticism or"
"disapproval would cut her impulse down, as frost cuts the life of"
"flowers.  Besides, there was always something fresh and individual in her"
things.  He asked her one day:
"""What does your husband think of these?"""
Gyp was silent a moment.
"""I don't show them to him."""
She never had; she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she
"composed, dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves,"
"and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself,"
"frail enough plant already.  The only person, besides her master, to whom"
she confided her efforts was--strangely enough--Rosek.  But he had
"surprised her one day copying out some music, and said at once: ""I knew."
"I was certain you composed.  Ah, do play it to me!  I am sure you have"
"talent.""  The warmth with which he praised that little ""caprice"" was"
"surely genuine; and she felt so grateful that she even played him others,"
"and then a song for him to sing.  From that day, he no longer seemed to"
"her odious; she even began to have for him a certain friendliness, to be"
"a little sorry, watching him, pale, trim, and sphinx-like, in her"
"drawing-room or garden, getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his"
"desire.  He had never again made love to her, but she knew that at the"
least sign he would.  His face and his invincible patience made him
pathetic to her.  Women such as Gyp cannot actively dislike those who
admire them greatly.  She consulted him about Fiorsen's debts.  There
"countrymen in South Africa, there stood up a man himself nurtured in"
"luxury, to take up the burden of the disinherited. His wife too stood by"
"him, a lady of gentle birth. We all know who that man is--he is"
"Gandhi,--and what humiliations and suffering he went through. Do you"
think he suffered in vain and that his voice remained unheard? It was
"not so, for in the great vortex of passion for Justice, there were"
caught others--men like Polak and Andrews. Are they your countrymen? Not
"in the narrow sense of the word but truly in a larger sense, that these"
who choose to bear and suffer belong to one clan the clan from which
Kshatriya Chivalry is recruited. The removal of suffering and of the
cause of suffering is the Dharma of the strong Kshatriya. The earth is
the wide and universal theatre of man's woeful pageant. The question is
who is to suffer more than his share. Is the burden to fall on the weak
or the strong? Is it to be under hopeless compulsion or of voluntary
acceptance?

At no time within the recent history of India has there been so quick a

she had made an attempt against her own life.  I believed that she had
"suffered, and was still suffering, from the effects of some poison, the"
exact nature of which neither Deane nor Trepard could as yet determine.

In an instant the truth was plain.  She was aware that I had transferred

He figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team came

occupation for the cutting-out of a baby's pinafore for an East-end
child whom she had under her special patronage. But her mind was
"active and, stern, self-opinionated martinet that she was, she could"
not altogether crush the regrets that swarmed up in this last
reckoning up of her life's activity. Better had her charity and
interest been centered on the dirty little children whom she had
indignantly tolerated on her compound! Better for them all would it
have been had each one of them sought to win the love and respect of
"the subject race! Then, perhaps, they would not have been deserted in"

Mrs. Carmichael glanced at Beatrice Cary with a fresh pricking of
"conscience. What, after all, had she done to deserve the chief"
condemnation? She had played with fire. Had they not all played with

"and throw away. Did they not all, behind their seeming tolerance and"
"Christian principles, hide an equal depreciation? Was she even as bad"
"as some? How many men revealed to their syces their darkest moods,"
their lowest passions? How many women were to their ayahs subjects for
"contemptuous Bazaar gossip. They were all to blame, and this was the"

"pocket. He knew that Captain Dove was merely trying to aggravate him,"
and it would not have been politic to stray from the matter in hand. He
lighted a cigarette at his leisure and waited for what should come next.
He had changed his mind as to taking the old man fully into his
confidence. He thought he could see his way to get all he wanted for a
very great deal less than that might have cost him.
"""Want a drink?"" Captain Dove demanded, no doubt with the idea that a"
"dose of spirit might serve to stir up his visitor's temper, and looked"
"surprised at Slyne's curt head-shake, still more surprised over his"
response.
"""I can't afford to drink at all hours of the day and night now,"" said"
"Slyne austerely. ""That sort of thing was all very well at sea, but--The"
business I have in hand isn't of the sort that can be carried out on raw
"brandy. And you'll have to taper off too, if you want to come in."""
"""Strike--me--sky-blue!"" exclaimed the old man, and Slyne held up a"
reproving hand.
"""I can do with a good deal less of your bad language into the bargain,"""
"he mentioned coldly, ""if you don't mind. In short, I want you to"
understand from the start that you've got to behave as if you were a
"reasonable human being and not a dangerous lunatic, or--I'll leave you"
"to rot, in the hole you've got yourself into."""
"Captain Dove, scarcely able to credit the evidence of his own ears but,"
"none the less, apparently, thinking hard, darted a very ugly glance at"
"him, and noticed the diamonds in his shirt-front. Under the strongest"
temptation to call in a couple of deck-hands and have him thrown off the
"ship, Captain Dove obviously paused to consider whether those could be"
"of any intrinsic value. He was, of course, satisfied that he knew"
"Francesco smote one brute through with his spear, as it was feeding in"
the gutter on the carcass of a child. In the market square the
Provencals had made such another massacre as they had perpetrated in
Alba. The horrible obscenity of the scene struck the duke's men dumb
"as the dead. The towns-folk had been stripped, bound face to face,"
left slain in many a hideous and ribald pose. The vultures' beaks had
emulated the sword. The stench from the place was as the breath of a
"charnel house, and the duke and his men turned back with grim faces"
from the brutal silence of that ghastly town.
"Near one of the gates a wild, tattered figure darted out from a"
"half-wrecked house, stood blinking at them in the sun, then sped away,"
"screaming and whimpering at the sight of the duke, as though possessed"
"with a demon. It was a woman, still retaining the traces of her former"
"great beauty, gone mad, yet the only live thing they found in the"
town.
"The duke had reined in his steed at the sight, gone white to the roots"
"of his hair. Then he covered his face with his hands, and Francesco"
heard him utter a heart-rending moan.
"When his hands fell, after a lapse of time, he seemed to have aged"
years in this brief space.
"""Forward, my men,"" he shouted with iron mouth. ""The Frangipani shall"
"not complain of our swords!"""
They passed out of Ninfa through the opposite gate. At dark they
"reached the moors, and soon the entire host swept silently into the"
"ebony gloom of the great forests, which seemed sealed up against the"
moon and stars.
"and the little Queen of Spain!"""
"She subsided on a stone, dropped her head into her hands, and took no"
"further notice of the Sergeant, who stood awhile with his hand resting"
"on her shoulder in deep meditation. There was, he thought, no more to be"
said or done. He knew all there was to know. The men had not asked him
"to join them, so he would venture no further questions as to the time"
and the manner of attack. They were still jealous of him with that
easily aroused jealousy of south and north which in Spain divides even
the clannish gipsy.
Nevertheless he went the round of the men. They were mostly busy with
"their games, and some of them even snatched the stakes in to them, lest"
he should demand a percentage of the winnings after the manner of
Sevilla. The Sergeant smiled at the reputation which distance and many
"tongues had given him. Then, with a few words of good fellowship and"
"the expression of a wish for success and abundant plunder, he bade them"
farewell. It was a great deed which they designed and one worthy of his
"best days. He was now old, he said, and must needs choose easier"
courses. He did not desire twice to feel the grip of the collar of iron.
"But young blood--oh, it would have its way and run its risks!"
Here the Sergeant smiled and raised his Montera cap. The men as
"courteously bade him good-day, preserving, however, a certain respectful"
"distance, and adding nothing to the information he had already obtained."
"But Chica, seated on her stone, with her scarlet-bound head on her hand,"
neither looked up nor gave him any greeting as his feet went slowly down
the rocky glen and crunched over the begrimed patches of last year's
"snow, now wide-pored and heavy with the heat of noonday."
"""Kyrie Eleison! Christe Eleison! Kyrie Eleison!"""
"A faint cold tremor crept through his veins,--his heart beat"
"violently,--again he vainly strove to open the great door. Was there a"
choir practising inside at this hour of the night? Surely not!
"Then,--from whence had this music its origin? Stooping, he bent his ear"
"to the crevice of the closed portal,--but, as suddenly as they had"
"begun, the harmonies ceased; and all was once more profoundly still."
"Drawing a long, deep breath, he stood for a moment amazed and lost in"
"thought--these sounds, he felt sure, were not of earth but of heaven!"
they had the same ringing sweetness as those he had heard on the Field
"of Ardath! What might they mean to him, here and now? Quick as a flash"
the answer came--DEATH! God had taken pity upon his solitary earth
"wanderings,--and the prayers of Edris had shortened his world-exile and"
"probation! He was to die! and that solemn singing was the warning,--or"
"the promise,--of his approaching end!"
"Yes! it must be so, he decided, as, with a strange, half-sad peace at"
"his heart, he quietly descended the steps of the Dom,-he would perhaps"
"be permitted to finish the work he was at present doing,--and"
"then,--then, the poet-pen would be laid aside forever, chains would be"
"undone, and he would be set at liberty! Such was his fixed idea. Was he"
"glad of the prospect, he asked himself? Yes, and No! For himself he was"
glad; but in these latter days he had come to understand the thousand
"wordless wants and aspirations of mankind,--wants and aspirations to"
which only the Poet can give fitting speech; he had begun to see how
much can be done to cheer and raise and ennoble the world by even ONE
"true, brave, earnest, and unselfish worker,--and he had attained to"
such a height in sympathetic comprehension of the difficulties and
"drawbacks of others, that he had ceased to consider himself at all in"
"the question, either with regard to the Present or the immortal"
"suddenly turned back, with a quick warning cry to her cavalcade. The"
"donkey instantly stood still, patient amid its fagots as an image in a"
"church. The goats scattered like water poured on flat ground, and began"
"to crop stray blades of grass, invisible to any eyes but their own, amid"
wastes of cracked earth and deserts of grey water-worn pebbles.
"As she looked back, Sergeant Cardono was disappearing up among the"
"tumbled foot-hills and dry beds of winter torrents, which render the"
"lower spurs of the Guadarrama such a puzzle to the stranger, and such a"
paradise for the smuggler and _guerrillero_. In another moment he had
disappeared. With a long quiet sigh La Giralda stole back to the
"farmhouse. In spite of her race, and heathenish lack of creed, the spark"
of humanity was far from dead in her bosom. The thought of the open eyes
"of the little girl, which gazed even in death with fixed rapture upon"
"her wooden treasure, remained with her."
"""The woman is as old as I--she can bide her time!"" she muttered to"
"herself. ""But the child--these arms are not yet so shrunken that they"
"cannot dig up a little earth to lay the babe thereunder."""
"And at the chamber door La Giralda paused. Like her people, she was"
neither a good nor yet a bad Catholic. Consciously or unconsciously she
"held a more ancient faith, though she worshipped at no shrine, told no"
"beads, and uttered no prayers."
"""They have not been long dead,"" she said to herself, as she entered;"
"""the window is open and the air is sweet. Yet the plague, which snatches"
"away the young and strong, may look askance at old Giralda's hold on"
"life, which at the best is no stronger than the strength of a"
"basting-thread!"""
"Having said these words she advanced to the low trundle-bed, and,"
dedication of Suetonius two years before; but his real purpose is to say
"something about Luther. Luther's writings, he says, have given the"
Louvain obscurants plenty of reason to inveigh against the _bonae
"literae_, to decry all scholars. He himself does not know Luther and has"
"glanced through his writings only cursorily as yet, but everyone praises"
his life. How little in accordance with theological gentleness it is to
"condemn him offhand, and that before the indiscreet vulgar! For has he"
"not proposed a dispute, and submitted himself to everybody's judgement?"
"No one has, so far, admonished, taught, convinced him. Every error is"
not at once heresy.
"The best of Christianity is a life worthy of Christ. Where we find that,"
we should not rashly suspect people of heresy. Why do we so uncharitably
"persecute the lapses of others, though none of us is free from error?"
"Why do we rather want to conquer than cure, suppress than instruct?"
"But he concludes with a word that could not but please Luther's friends,"
who so hoped for his support. 'May the duke prevent an innocent man from
being surrendered under the cloak of piety to the impiety of a few. This
"is also the wish of Pope Leo, who has nothing more at heart than that"
innocence be safe.'
At this same time Erasmus does his best to keep Froben back from
"publishing Luther's writings, 'that they may not fan the hatred of the"
_bonae literae_ still more'. And he keeps repeating: I do not know
"Luther, I have not read his writings. He makes this declaration to"
"Luther himself, in his reply to the latter's epistle of 28 March. This"
"letter of Erasmus, dated 30 May 1519, should be regarded as a newspaper"
"leader[17], to acquaint the public with his attitude towards the Luther"
question. Luther does not know the tragedies which his writings have
caused at Louvain. People here think that Erasmus has helped him in
composing them and call him the standard bearer of the party! That
"purchasers, the former being mounted as a curiosity, while the backbone"
forms a novel and serviceable walking-stick.
One method of trapping these monsters which affords keen delight was
"related to me. The requirements are an electric battery, some rope, a"
"few feet of electric wire, a cartridge, and an empty box, with a chunk"
"or two of bad meat. The cartridge is fitted with an electric primer,"
the wire of which stretches to the battery. This cartridge is buried
"in a hunk of meat, the whole being dangled from a box--an empty cask is"
"better--which serves as a float, while a rope is stretched from the box"
"to the shore, with the electric wire spirally wound round it. A short"
"length of chain is preferable, if available, to attach the bait to the"
"float, but a short piece of rope will do. This novel line is thrown"
"into the water, and the man keeps his eye on the float, with one finger"
"on the battery. The hungry shark, espying the tempting morsel, makes a"
"grab and swallows it, but the chain prevents him tearing away with it."
"The pull causes the float to disappear, the man’s finger presses the"
"button, and the trick is done. There is an explosion, and pieces of"
shark and showers of water fly into the air. The incident is all over
too quickly for the fish to marvel about the strange indigestibility
of the tainted meat he grabbed so greedily. The men enjoy this sport
"hugely when it can be followed, as they regard the shark with intense"
detestation.

"Despite the vigilance of the various Powers, slave-running is still a"
lucrative business on these forbidding coasts. Now and again a forced
white patch of a sail showed vaguely through the gathering gloom.
Their black armor stood out ghostly against the ascetic trunks of the
"trees. Grim silence prevailed, and so immobile was their attitude,"
"that they might have been taken for stone images of a dead, gone age."
"The wind cried restlessly amid the trees, gusty at intervals, but"
tuning its mood to a desolate and constant moan. The woods seemed full
of a vague woe and of troubled breathings. The trees seemed to sway to
"one another, to fling strange words with the tossing of hair and"
"outstretched hands. The furze in the valley, swept and harrowed,"
undulated like a green lagoon.
"Between the hills and the cliff lay the marshes, threaded by a meagre"
stream that quavered through the green. A poison mist hung over them
despite the wind. The mournful clangor of a bell came up from the
"valley, with a vague sound as of voices chanting."
After a time the bell ceased pulsing. In its stead sounded a faint
"eerie whimper, an occasional shrill cry that startled the moorlands,"
leaped out of silence like a bubble from a pool where death has been.
The men were shaken from their strained vigilance as by a wind. The
"utter gray of the hour seemed to stifle them, then a sound stumbled"
"out of the silence and set them listening. It dwindled and grew again,"
came nearer: it was the smite of hoofs in the wood-ways. The rider
"dismounted, tethered his foam-flecked steed to a tree and stumbled up"
"to where the Duke of Spoleto and Francesco stood, their gaze riveted"
upon the ghostly masonry of Astura.
Panting and exhausted he faced the twain.
"""They have all died on the scaffold,"" he said with a hoarse, rasping"
"would be a further reduction. That was quite true. Bob knew, because he"
had had a vast deal of experience with the trust’s method of doing
"business. They would ruin him, no matter how great the cost, because he"
was dangerous to their continued well-being. With Bainbridge in the
"ring, and fighting vigorously against the graft and wholesale theft of"
"timberlands, those juicy melon cuttings which had been so pleasing to"
the stockholders would cease--therefore Bainbridge must go.
"Presently Bob’s eyes fell again to the letter, and somehow that single"
sentence seemed to stand out as if written in capitals: “It hurts like
"sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left to do but give in and make"
the best terms we can.”
"For a second Bob stared, the blood rushing into his face, a crimson"
"flood. Make terms with Crane? Go on his knees to that scoundrel, who had"
long ago parted with the last shred of decency and self-respect? Not
much!
"They must have resources enough to meet that note, at least. The trust"
could not keep the price of lumber down indefinitely. They must weather
"the storm in some way. And when this drive was safe at the mills, ready"
"to be cut into lumber, they would have the laugh on Elihu Crane."
"Oblivious to the men about him, even to the fact that the cook had some"
"time ago announced supper, Bainbridge began to search his mind for means"
of staving off the evil day. Most of the stocks and bonds constituting
his private fortune had been already pledged as collateral for loans to
the firm. He still had a few thousand dollars’ worth of Steel Preferred
"which could be sold; and there was Pinecrest, the beautiful and costly"
"home on the outskirts of Bangor, which had been left him by his father."
"It should not be difficult to raise a mortgage of ten thousand, at"
"least, on the place."
"of all virtue. The type is well-known, and can be found at resorts and"
"boarding-houses, where it grows and flourishes."
"In spite of her wasted adolescence, her examination and her"
"""independence,"" she has been coming home from her office stool or her"
teacher's desk more or less exhausted; suddenly she finds herself in the
"midst of a sweet and unlimited idleness, with quantities of tinned food"
"for her meals. The company round her is continually changing, tourists"
"come and go, and she passes from hand to hand for walks and talks; the"
"tone is ""country informality."" This is sheer loose living; this is a life"
stripped of all purpose. She does not even sleep enough because she hears
"through the thin wall every sound made by her neighbor in the next room,"
while arriving or departing Englishmen bang doors all night. In a short
"time she has become a neurotic, sated with company, surfeited with herself"
and the place. She is ready to go off with the next halfway respectable
organ grinder that happens along. And so she pairs off with the most
"casual visitors, flirts with the guide, hovering about him and making"
"bandages for his fingers, and at last throws herself into the arms of a"
nameless nobody who has arrived at the house today.
This is the Torsen type.
"And now, at this very moment, she retires to her room to collect the"
"fragments of herself, in preparation for her departure--at the end of the"
"summer. It takes time; there are so many fragments, one in every corner."
But perhaps it consoles her to think that she knows the genitive of
_mensa_.
"Things are not quite so bad for the actor. He has staked nothing, is"
"committed to nothing. No part of his life is destroyed, nor anything"
"within him. As he came, so he goes, cheerful, empty, nice. In fact he is"
even something more of a man because he has really made a conquest. He has
you would heed no warnings.  The end should have been plain to you from
"the beginning, an you would not mend your ways.  I told you how it needs"
must be; and now the time has come when you see it for yourself.  Worse
"men are put in the parts that you excelled in, because they can be"
depended upon.  No drunkard can ever become great.  Put that in your
"pipe and smoke it, Lionel Field."""
"At the sound of this new voice, speaking out of the shadows of the"
"ingle-nook, a great hush had fallen upon the room.  Grey leaned forward"
"to obtain a view of the speaker, and the firelight played upon the"
striking features and iron-gray hair of a very remarkable-looking old
"man of leonine aspect, whose voice was of that penetrating quality which"
makes itself heard without being raised; and it was plain that something
"in the personality of the man lifted him above his fellows, for all"
"listened in silence whilst he spoke, and even the arrogant young actor"
looked for the moment abashed.
"""Who is it?"" whispered Grey to the man next him; and the answer came"
"readily, though spoken in a cautious whisper."
"""His name is Jonathan Wylde.  Once he, too, was a famous actor; but long"
"illness crippled his limbs, and he has fallen into poverty.  He is"
"always called the Old Lion, and methinks the name suits him well.  He is"
"a very lion for courage, else would he not dare to rebuke Master Lionel"
"Field.  For he is one who is ready with his fist, or with knife or"
"bludgeon, and it is ill work meeting him when he is in his cups."""
Grey looked with interest and attention at the old man in the shadows;
"but he was leaning back again, and spoke no more.  The talk surged round"
him again from the rest; they spoke of the plays that were being enacted
"at the various theatres, and of those who were playing the various"
_rôles_.  Some of them stood up and rolled forth bits of Congreve’s
"all that about Gaspard and the society came out, would they not call him"
"an accessory before the fact? The noose seemed really rather near, and"
"in his frightened fancy, as he lay sleepless beside his snoring wife,"
the rope dangled over his head. The poor wretch was between the devil
and the deep sea--between stern law and cruel Rule 3. He dared not toss
"about, his wife would ask him what ailed him; he lay as still as he"
"could, bitterly cursing his folly for mingling in such affairs, bitterly"
cursing the Frenchman who led him on into the trap and left him fast
there. How could he save his neck? And he restlessly rent the band of
"his coarse night-shirt, that pressed on his throat with a horrible"
suggestion of what might be. Where was that Gaspard? Had he fled over
"the sea? Ah, if he could be sure of that, and sure that the dreaded man"
"would not return! Or was he lurking in some secret hole, ready to steal"
out and avenge a violation of Rule 3? The doorkeeper had always feared
"the man; in the lurid light of this deed, Gaspard's image grew into a"
"monster of horror, threatening sudden and swift revenge for disobedience"
"or treachery. No; he must stand firm. But what of the police? Well, men"
"sleep somehow, and at last he fell asleep, holding the band of the"
night-shirt away from his throat: if he fell asleep with that pressing
"on him, God knew what he might dream."
"""It's very lucky,"" remarked the Superintendent of Police, who had a"
"happy habit of looking at the bright side of things, to one of his"
"subordinates, ""that this Benham seems to have had no relations and"
"precious few friends."""
"""No widows coming crying about,"" observed the subordinate, with an"
assenting nod.
"""Nothing known of him except that he came to Kirton a few months back,"
"did nothing, seemed to have plenty of money, took his liquor, played a"
"hand at cards, hurt nobody, seemingly knew nobody."""
"""Of course, you can do nothing abrupt; but you'll gradually withdraw"
"from their acquaintance, won't you?"""
"Alicia had escaped without a promise, pleading for time to think in the"
same breath that she denied any concern in the matter. She was by way of
"thinking now, and all that Lady Eynesford had said repeated itself in"
her mind as she looked out on the garden and the glimpses of the town
"beyond. She understood now Dick's banishment, her sister-in-law's"
"unresting hostility to the Medlands, and the reason why she had been"
"pressed to go to Australia. She spared a minute to grief for Daisy, but"
"her own sorrow would not be denied, and engrossed her again. In the"
"solitude she had sought, she cried to herself, ""Why didn't they tell me"
"before? What's the use of telling me now?"" Then she would fly back to"
"the hope that the thing was not true, that her friends had clutched too"
"hastily at anything which would save her from what they dreaded, and,"
"she confessed to herself, rightly dreaded. No, she would not believe it"
"yet; and, if it were not true, why should she not be happy? Why should"
"she not, even though she did what Dick had not dared to do, and what,"
"when Coxon asked her, she had laughed at for an absurdity?"
There began to be more movement outside the gates. The first note of
"band-music was wafted to her ear, and the roll of wheels announced the"
return of the church-goers. She roused herself and went to meet them.
"They were agog with excitement, partly about the meeting, partly about"
the murder. While Eleanor was trying to tell her of the state of
"popular feeling, the Governor seized her arm and began to detail the"
story of the discovery.
"""You remember the man?"" he asked. ""He was at our flower-show--had a sort"
"of row with Medland, you know. Well, he's been found murdered (so the"
police think) in a low part of the town! The woman who keeps the house
"would simply ask those who agitate and cry the Yellow Peril, the means"
"they would suggest for the adopting of their propaganda, if their words"
are not to be empty ones.
"Suppose any country wanted to subjugate Japan, and should want to send"
"an army to fight on the soil of Japan, what number of men do they think"
"would suffice? No general in the whole world would, I am sure, be bold"
enough to undertake the task with under one million men. I have reason
"to believe even that number would not suffice, but for a moment let it"
be that number. What country in the world can send that number over the
"broad ocean? Germany, France, England, or America? Russia seems to have"
"the greatest chance, being nearer to Japan. But her experience is"
already known.
"Suppose the idea of a land campaign be abandoned, and only a fleet be"
"sent to intimidate Japan by sea battles, or by harassing her commerce."
There would certainly be a better chance for any of the Occidental
"fleets than for the armies, in coping with the forces of Japan. Above"
"all, I frankly admit that England would be the most formidable foe in"
"that respect. But excepting England, is there any other country that can"
say with certainty that it can easily crush the Japanese navy? Is it
Germany? is it France? or is it--America?
"But supposing our navy were crushed; what next? It would, of course, be"
"a very ugly thing for us, but it would not mean the subjection of Japan."
"Our sea-coast towns may be bombarded, our commerce may be harassed, but"
"Japan will still subsist within her soil, for she can live without"
"depending on any other country for food. And, besides, disturbance of"
commerce would not be a loss only to her.
"Moreover, any country which should embark on such an enterprise would"
"have need to think it over twice (or, indeed, three or four times)"
given to wickedness.
Down in the shady angle of the little orchard the old gipsy found a
"little garden of flowers, geranium and white jasmine, perhaps planted to"
"cast into the rude coffin of a neighbour, _Yerba Luisa_, or lemon"
"verbena for the decoctions of a simple pharmacopoeia, on the outskirts"
of these a yet smaller plot had been set aside. It was edged with white
"stones from the hillside, and many coloured bits of broken crockery"
decorated it. A rose-bush in the midst had been broken down by some
"hasty human foot, or perhaps by a bullock or other large trespassing"
animal. There were nigh a score of rose-buds upon it--all now parched
"and dead, and the whole had taken on the colour of the soil."
La Giralda stood a moment before laying her burden down. She had the
strong heart of her ancient people. The weakness of tears had not
"visited her eyes for years--indeed, not since she was a girl, and had"
"cried at parting from her first sweetheart, whom she never saw again. So"
she looked apparently unmoved at the pitiful little square of cracked
"earth, edged with its fragments of brown and blue pottery, and at the"
"broken rose-bush lying as if also plague-stricken across it, dusty,"
"desolate, and utterly forlorn. Yet, as we have said, was her heart by no"
"means impervious to feeling. She had wonderful impulses, this parched"
mahogany-visaged Giralda.
"""It is the little one's own garden--I will lay her here!"" she said to"
herself.
So without another word she departed in search of mattock and spade. She
"found them easily and shortly, for the hireling servants of the house"
"had fled in haste, taking nothing with them. In a quarter of an hour the"
"hole was dug. The rose-tree, being in the way, was dragged out and"
"thrown to one side. La Giralda, who began to think of her donkey and"
"Thus there is no escape, no loophole for a delusive hope, only the"
cultivation of the courage of sorrow.
There are never any exceptions to the laws of the Buddha. If a law is a
"law, that is the end of it. Just as we know of no exceptions to the law"
"of gravitation, so there are no exceptions to the law of death."
"But although this may seem to be a religion of despair, it is not really"
so. This sorrow to which there is no relief is the selfishness of
"sorrow, the grief for our own loneliness; for of sorrow, of fear, of"
"pity for the dead, there is no need. We know that in time all will be"
"well with them. We know that, though there may be before them vast"
"periods of suffering, yet that they will all at last be in Nebhan with"
"us. And if we shall not know them there, still we shall know that they"
"are there, all of them--not one will be wanting. Purified from the lust"
"of life, white souls steeped in the Great Peace, all living things will"
attain rest at last.
"There is this remarkable fact in Buddhism, that nowhere is any fear"
"expressed of death itself, nowhere any apprehension of what may happen"
"to the dead. It is the sorrow of separation, the terror of death to the"
"survivors, that is always dwelt upon with compassion, and the agony of"
which it is sought to soothe.
That the dying man himself should require strengthening to face the King
of Terrors is hardly ever mentioned. It seems to be taken for granted
that men should have courage in themselves to take leave of life
"becomingly, without undue fears. Buddhism is the way to show us the"
"escape from the miseries of life, not to give us hope in the hour of"
death.
"village. She assured the king that he was loyal and good, and would do"
no evil.
"The king was rather abashed that his design had been discovered, but he"
was firm in his purpose. He assured the queen that the blacksmith should
"come to no harm, but rather good; and he ordered the queen to obey him,"
threatening her that if she refused he would be sure that she was
"disloyal also, and there would be no alternative but to send and arrest"
"the blacksmith by force, and punish her, the queen, too. Then the queen"
said that if the king swore to her that her brother should come to no
"harm, she would write as ordered. _And the king swore._"
"So the queen wrote to her brother, and adjured him by his love to her to"
"come down to the Golden City. She said she had dire need of him, and she"
told him that the king had sworn that no harm should come to him.
The letter was sent off by a king's messenger. In due time the
"blacksmith arrived, and he was immediately seized and thrown into prison"
to await his trial.
"When the queen saw that she had been deceived, she was in despair. She"
"tried by every way, by tears and entreaties and caresses, to move the"
"king, but all without avail. Then she tried by plotting and bribery to"
"gain her brother's release, but it was all in vain. The day for trial"
"came quickly, and the blacksmith was tried, and he was condemned and"
sentenced to be burnt alive by the river on the following day.
On the evening of the day of trial the queen sent a message to the king
"to come to her; and when the king came reluctantly, fearing a renewal of"
"entreaties, expecting a woman made of tears and sobs, full of grief, he"
found instead that the queen had dried her eyes and dressed herself
"still more beautifully than ever, till she seemed to the king the very"
"""I don't believe he will,"" I observed, laughing. ""There will be a sham"
Dawson in the office and the genuine article will be out on the
"rampage. He is a man who couldn't sit still, not even if you tied him"
"in his chair and sealed the knots."""
We spent a pleasant hour pulling Dawson to pieces and leaving to him
"not a rag of virtue, except intense professional zeal. We exchanged"
"experiences of him, those of the chief assistant being particularly"
rich and highly flavoured. It appeared that Dawson when off duty loved
to occupy the platform at meetings of his religious connection and to
"hold forth to the elect. The privilege of ""sitting under him"" had been"
"enjoyed more than once by the assistant, who retailed to us extracts"
"from Dawson's favourite sermon on ""Truth."" His views upon Truth were"
"unbending as armour plate. ""Under no circumstances, not to save"
"oneself from imminent death, not to shield a wife or a child from the"
"penalties for a lapse from virtue, not even to preserve one's country"
"from the attacks of an enemy, was it permissible to a Peculiar Baptist"
to diverge by the breadth of a hair from the straight path of Truth.
Hell yawned on either hand; only along the knife edge of Truth could
"salvation be reached."""
"""He made me shiver,"" said the chief assistant, ""and he drove me to"
thinking of one or two little deceptions of my own. When Dawson
"preaches, his eyes blaze, his voice breaks, and he will fall on his"
knees and pray for the souls of those who heed not his words. You
can't look at him then and not believe that he means every word he
"says. Yet it's all humbug."""
"""No, it is not,"" said I. ""Dawson in the pulpit, or on the tub--or"
whatever platform he uses--is absolutely genuine. He is the finest
example that I have ever met of the dual personality. He is in dead
the one or the other.  But yet he must break away.  Pacing up and down
"the room, he seemed to see the soft earnest eyes of the Lady Geraldine"
"bent upon him.  He had pledged his word to her, and in spirit to his"
dead mother.  From that pledge there was no drawing back.  Yet how could
the break best be made?
He thought over the engagements already entered into.  Was it needful
that these should be kept? He thought not—at least not those which were
but promises to meet at such and such clubs or coffee-houses for the
purposes of card-playing and similar recreations.  But there was one
engagement that Grey did not see his way honourably to break. He had
promised to ride Don Carlos the following Saturday in a course against
"three other picked horses, and heavy wagers, he knew, had been laid upon"
or against his steed.  This engagement he felt he could not break; but
the rest he would.  He might even make the excuse that Don Carlos wanted
"attention, and that he was going to take him into the country for"
"purposes of training; and, once away from Sandford House, he ought to be"
"able to pen a letter to the master which might excuse his return, and"
explain the nature of the change which had come over him.
"Yes, that would be the way.  He would not go open-mouthed to him this"
"morning, to be perhaps scoffed or cajoled into some rash compromise."
Grey knew that his ability to see both sides of a question often led him
into difficulties and the appearance of vacillation.  Surely he could
keep his pledge if he made the break with a certain diplomatic skill.
"Not only would it be easier to himself, but it might prove the safer"
method also.
"When he saw Lord Sandford in the midst of his friends, laughing at the"
"last bit of scandal, passing jokes over the latest repartee of the"
"redoubtable Duchess of Marlborough to the meek Queen, discussing the"
"rivalries of the ministers, and the other rivalries (to them more"
"jealousy swept over him; and when I told him of my resolution, I trow"
"that his suspicions received confirmation.  I did not see it then, but I"
"see it now.  He thought I left him to pursue my ends alone, and,"
"perchance, to seek to win the lady of his choice.  But he spoke nothing"
"of this—only insisted that for this week my engagements should be kept,"
"and that after to-day’s race I might go my own way, an I was so"
resolved.  He was not unkindly; yet there was something strange and
"stern in his bearing and language, and you have seen how his imperious"
temper and will sweep all before them.  I myself was strangely dazed and
something sorrowful.  I scarce do know why my heart was so heavy within
me.  I let him have his way; and you behold what that way has been.  I
"am a ruined man, beggared of all my winnings; and methinks my Lord"
"Sandford has plotted for this very thing."""
"""It is a shame!  Would I could take my horsewhip to him—"""
"""Nay, nay, good Dicon; be not so wroth,"" spoke Grey calmly and quietly."
"""In sooth, I know not that I owe him aught but thanks.  When all is said"
"and done, it was but ill-gotten gain.  I would sooner face life with"
"none of it upon me.  I had a few guineas to start with—well, it was more"
"than a few; yet had I spent my time in London, I should have had but"
"little left by now.  I have learned many lessons, and I shall start"
"clear of debt, and without my pockets filled with other men’s gold."""
Dick was scarce moralist enough to understand or appreciate his master’s
"scruples—scruples new, indeed, to Grey himself—but the faithful fellow"
was ready to accept any verdict and any decision made by the man he
loved and served; and as he put the finishing touches to the workmanlike
"riding toilet which he had in readiness, he remarked with a short"
"laugh,—"
"""Faith, master, you and I betwixt us, with Don Carlos and my good nag"
"it than anybody else except God 'lmighty. If the fish hug the shore,"
"then we're up against it, but I think they strike in about here; that's"
"why I chose this site. We can't tell, though, till the run starts. All"
"we can do now is see that them people keep their distance."""
"The ""lead"" of a salmon-trap consists of a row of web-hung piling that"
"runs out from the shore for many hundred feet, forming a high, stout"
fence that turns the schools of fish and leads them into cunningly
"contrived enclosures, or ""pounds,"" at the outer extremity, from which"
"they are ""brailed"" as needed. These corrals are so built that once the"
fish are inside they cannot escape. The entire structure is devised
"upon the principle that the salmon will not make a short turn, but will"
swim as nearly as possible in a straight line. It looked to Boyd as if
"Marsh, by blocking the line of progress above and below, had virtually"
"destroyed the efficiency of the new trap, rendering the cost of its"
construction a total loss.
"""Sometimes you can cork a trap and sometimes you can't,"" Balt went on."
"""It all depends on the currents, the lay of the bars, and a lot of"
things we don't know nothing about. I've spent years in trying to
"locate the point where them fish strike in, and I think it's just below"
"here. It'll all depend on how good I guessed."""
"""Exactly! And if you guessed wrong--"""
"""Then we'll fish with nets, like we used to before there was any traps."""
"That evening, when he had seen the night-shift started, Emerson decided"
"to walk up to Cherry's house, for he was worried over the day's"
developments and felt that an hour of the girl's society might serve to
clear his thoughts. His nerves were high-strung from the tension of the
"past weeks, and he knew himself in the condition of an athlete trained"
did not deserve to suffer suffered. And that was why the war went on.
Most people were so indifferent that it was impossible to talk to them
without anger. I could think of nothing else but the war. I could not
escape from its invisible presence. The streets and houses seemed the
"immaterial creations of some dream, and somewhere behind them the"
"slaughter was going on, and amid the noise of the traffic the throbbing"
of the bombardment was plainly audible.
Sometimes I felt an impulse to shout from the house-tops like a Hebrew
prophet and denounce this most wicked of generations. But the very
futility of the idea filled me with mortification.
Our enlightened twentieth century has no use for prophets. Christ
Himself would have been arrested as a pacifist or a lunatic if He had
spoken His mind in the streets of London. And the clergy would have
"applauded the imprisonment of a dangerous ""pro-German."" The scribes and"
Pharisees were more numerous and more powerful than ever before.
Particularly the scribes.
There never was in all the world an infamy as great as the infamy of our
war-time Press. A horde of unscrupulous liars and hirelings spat hatred
and malice from safe and comfortable positions. They played the hero
when no danger threatened. They defied an enemy who could not reach
them. They boasted of the deeds they had not done. They gloried in the
victories they did not win. They mouthed frantic protestations of
injured innocence when they should have felt the burden of guilty shame.
They were mawkishly sentimental when they should have felt keen grief
and horror. They denounced murder and they urged others to commit
murder. They spewed their venomous slime into every spring of healing
water. At a time when clear thinking and balanced judgments were needed
"more desperately than ever before, they squirted into the air thick"
"is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat."
But there is a gulf between oneself and them. They have no inkling of
"our crucifixion, our universal consciousness. Each of them is pivoted"
"and limited to himself, as the wild animals are. They look out, and they"
"see other objects, objects to ridicule or mistrust or to sniff curiously"
"at. But ""thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" has never entered"
"their souls at all, not even the thin end of it. They might love their"
"neighbour, with a hot, dark, unquestioning love. But the love would"
probably leave off abruptly. The fascination of what is beyond them has
not seized on them. Their neighbour is a mere external. Their life is
"centripetal, pivoted inside itself, and does not run out towards others"
"and mankind. One feels for the first time the real old mediaeval life,"
which is enclosed in itself and has no interest in the world outside.
"And so they lie about on the seats, play a game, shout, and sleep,"
and settle their long stocking-caps: and spit. It is wonderful in
them that at this time of day they still wear the long stocking-caps
as part of their inevitable selves. It is a sign of obstinate and
powerful tenacity. They are not going to be broken in upon by
world-consciousness. They are not going into the world's common clothes.
"Coarse, vigorous, determined, they will stick to their own coarse dark"
stupidity and let the big world find its own way to its own enlightened
"hell. Their hell is their own hell, they prefer it unenlightened."
And one cannot help wondering whether Sardinia will resist right
through. Will the last waves of enlightenment and world-unity break over
them and wash away the stocking-caps? Or is the tide of enlightenment
and world-unity already receding fast enough?
"Certainly a reaction is setting in, away from the old universality,"
"back, away from cosmopolitanism and internationalism. Russia, with her"
trees.  Her mind was a whirl of impressions--Daphne Wing's figure against
"the door, Mr. Wagge's puggy grey-bearded countenance, the red"
"pampas-grass, the blue bowl, Rosek's face swooping at her, her last"
glimpse of her baby asleep under the trees!
"She reached Kensington Gardens, turned into that walk renowned for the"
"beauty of its flowers and the plainness of the people who frequent it,"
"and sat down on a bench.  It was near the luncheon-hour; nursemaids,"
"dogs, perambulators, old gentlemen--all were hurrying a little toward"
their food.  They glanced with critical surprise at this pretty young
"woman, leisured and lonely at such an hour, trying to find out what was"
"wrong with her, as one naturally does with beauty--bow legs or something,"
"for sure, to balance a face like that!  But Gyp noticed none of them,"
except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing.  For
"months she had resolutely cultivated insensibility, resolutely refused to"
"face reality; the barrier was forced now, and the flood had swept her"
"away.  ""Proceedings!"" Mr. Wagge had said.  To those who shrink from"
"letting their secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends, the"
"notion of a public exhibition of troubles simply never comes, and it had"
certainly never come to Gyp.  With a bitter smile she thought: 'I'm
"better off than she is, after all!  Suppose I loved him, too?  No, I"
never--never--want to love.  Women who love suffer too much.'
She sat on that bench a long time before it came into her mind that she
was due at Monsieur Harmost's for a music lesson at three o'clock.  It
was well past two already; and she set out across the grass.  The summer
"day was full of murmurings of bees and flies, cooings of blissful"
"pigeons, the soft swish and stir of leaves, and the scent of lime blossom"
"under a sky so blue, with few white clouds slow, and calm, and full.  Why"
"be unhappy?  And one of those spotty spaniel dogs, that have broad heads,"
"with frizzy topknots, and are always rascals, smelt at her frock and"
"moved round and round her, hoping that she would throw her sunshade on"
"gnashing of teeth ... save your teeth, or else you will not be able to"
protect yourself.  Here are twenty kopecks.  Go and buy a bottle of
"vodki for five kopecks, hot tripe or lungs, one pound of bread and two"
cucumbers.  When we have lived off our drunken headache we will think
"of the condition of affairs ..."""
"As a rule the consideration of the ""condition of affairs"" lasted some"
"two or three days, and only when the Captain had not a farthing left of"
the three roubles or five roubles given him by his grateful customer
did he say:
"""You came!  Do you see?  Now that we have drunk everything with you,"
"you fool, try again to regain the path of virtue and soberness.  It has"
"been truly said that if you do not sin, you will not repent, and, if"
"you do not repent, you shall not be saved.  We have done the first, and"
to repent is useless.  Let us make direct for salvation.  Go to the
"river and work, and if you think you cannot control yourself, tell the"
"contractor, your employer, to keep your money, or else give it to me."
"When you get sufficient capital, I will get you a pair of trousers and"
other things necessary to make you seem a respectable and hard-working
"man, persecuted by fate.  With decent-looking trousers you can go far."
"Now then, be off!"""
"Then the client would go to the river to work as a porter, smiling the"
while over the Captain's long and wise speeches. He did not distinctly
"understand them, but only saw in front of him two merry eyes, felt"
"their encouraging influence, and knew that in the loquacious Captain he"
had an arm that would assist him in time of need.
"And really it happened very often that, for a month or so, some"
"ticket-of-leave client, under the strict surveillance of the Captain,"
had the opportunity of raising himself to a condition better than that
"studied accidental glance which sees so much, I have felt almost sure"
that you were far from satisfied that Trehayne was the man he gave
"himself out to be. I have been useful to you. I have eaten your salt,"
and have served you as faithfully as was consistent with the supreme
Orders by which I direct my action. With you I have run down and
"captured German agents, wretched lumps of dirt, whom I loathe as much"
as you do. Those who have sworn fidelity to this fair country of
"England, and have accepted of her citizenship--things which I have"
never done--and then in fancied security have spied upon their adopted
"Mother, I loathe and spit upon. I have taken the police oath of"
"obedience to my superiors, and I have kept it, but I have never sworn"
"allegiance to His Majesty your King, whom I pray that God may preserve"
"though I am his enemy. To your blunt English mind, untrained in logic,"
my sentiments and actions may lack consistency. But no. Those agents
"whom we have run down, you and I, were traitors--traitors to England."
Of all traitors for whom Hell is hungry the German-born traitor is the
"most devilish. I would not have you think, my friend, that I am at one"
with them. Never while I have been in your pay and service have I had
any communication direct or indirect with any of the naturalised-
"British Prussian scum, who have betrayed your noble generosity. I have"
"taken my Orders from Vienna, I have communicated always direct with"
Vienna. I am an Austrian naval officer. I am no traitor to England.

I spring from an old Italian family which has long been settled in
Trieste. For many generations we have served in the Austrian Navy.
"With modern Italy, with the Italy above all which has thrown the Holy"
Father into captivity and stripped the Holy See of the dominions
"bestowed upon it by God, we have no part or lot. Yet when I have met"
"Italian officers, and those too of France, as I have frequently done"
"during my cruises afloat, I have felt with them a harmony of spirit"
When I sat at the feet of Professor Campbell Fraser in the Metaphysics
"classroom at Edinburgh in 1875, Ferrier's writings were being much read"
by us students. The influence of Sir William Hamilton was fast
crumbling in the minds of young men who felt rather than saw that much
"lay beyond it. We were still engrossed with the controversy, waged in"
"books which now, alas! sell for a tenth of their former price, about"
"the Conditioned and the Unconditioned. We still worked at Reid,"
"Hamilton, and Mansel. But the attacks of Mill on the one side, and of"
"Ferrier and Dr. Stirling on the other, were slowly but surely"
withdrawing our interest. Ferrier had pointed out a path which seemed
"to lead us in the direction of Germany if we would escape from Mill,"
and Stirling was urging us in the same sense. It was not merely that
"Ferrier had written books. He had died more than ten years earlier, but"
his personality was still a living influence. Echoes of his words came
"to us through Grant and Sellar. Outside the University, men like"
Blackwood and Makgill made us feel what a power he had been. But that
was not all for at least some of us. Mrs. Ferrier had removed to
Edinburgh--and I endorse all that my sister says of her rare quality.
"She lived in a house in Torphichen Street, which was the resort of"
"those attracted, not only by the memory of her husband, but by her own"
great gifts. She was an old lady and an invalid. But though she could
"not move from her chair, paralysis had not dimmed her mental powers."
She was a true daughter of 'Christopher North.' I doubt whether I have
"seen her rival in quickness, her superior I never saw. She could talk"
"admirably to those sitting near her, and yet follow and join in the"
conversation of another group at the end of the room. She could adapt
"herself to everyone--to the shy and awkward student of eighteen, who"
"like myself was too much in awe of her to do more unhelped than answer,"
and to the distinguished men of letters who came from every quarter
attracted by her reputation for brilliance. The words of no one could
"be more incisive, the words of no one were habitually more kind than"
hers. She had known everybody. She forgot nobody. In those days the
loaves of bread; and I saw with my own eyes a list of a hundred and
"thirty-eight bakehouses. The roar of the ways, choked with soldiers"
"and citizens, the babel of strange tongues, the clamour of bells and"
"trumpets, deafened us. The constant crowding and pushing and halting"
turned our heads. I forgot my grief and my hope too. Who but a madman
would look to find a single face where thousands gazed from the
"windows? or could deem himself important with this swarming, teeming"
hive before him? Steve stared stupidly about him; I rode dazed and
"perplexed. The troopers laughed at us, or promised us greater things"
"when we should see the Swedish Lager outside the town, and"
Wallenstein's great camp arrayed against it. But I noticed that even
"they, as we drew nearer to the heart of the city, fell silent at"
"times, and looked at one another, surprised at the great influx of"
people and the shifting scenes which the streets presented.
"For myself and Steve and the men, we were as good as nought. A house"
in the Ritter-Strasse was assigned to my lady for her quarters--no one
could lodge in the city without the leave of the magistrates; and we
"were glad to get into it and cool our dizzy heads, and look at one"
"another. Count Hugo stayed awhile, standing with my lady and the"
Waldgrave in one of the great oriels that overlooked the street. But a
"mounted messenger, sent on from the Town House, summoned him, and he"
took horse again for the camp. I do not know what we should have done
"without him at entering. The soldiers, who crowded the streets, showed"
"scant respect for names, and would as soon have jostled my lady as a"
citizen's wife; but wherever he came hats were doffed and voices
"lowered, and in the greatest press a way was made for him as by magic."
"For that night we had seen enough. I thought we had seen all, or that"
nothing in my life would ever surprise me again. But next day my lady
went up to the Burg on the hill in the middle of the city to look
"abroad, and took Steve and myself with her. And then I found that I"
"Bill Dawson takes a bit of knowing."""
"""Have you any news, Mr. Dawson?"" asked Cary eagerly."
"""Not much. The wires of the _Antinous_ have all been renewed--the"
Admiralty won't allow cables to be patched except at sea--but I
haven't found out who played hanky-panky with them. It could not have
"been any one in the engine-room party, as none of them went near the"
"place where the wires were cut. Besides, they were engineers, not"
"electricians, and could have known nothing of the arrangements and"
disposition of the ship's wires. My man who worked with them is
"positive that they are a sound, good lot without a sea-lawyer or a"
"pacifist among them; a gang of plain, honest tykes. So we are thrown"
"back on the maintenance party, included in which were all sorts of"
ratings. Some of them are skilled in the electrical fittings--my own
"man with them is, for one--but we get the best accounts of all of"
"them. They are long service men, cast for sea owing to various medical"
"reasons, but perfectly efficient for harbour work. Among the officers"
of the ship is a R.N.R. lieutenant with a German name. I jumped to
"him, but the captain laughed. The man's father and grandfather were in"
"the English merchant service, and though his people originally came"
"from Saxony, he is no more German than we are ourselves. Besides, my"
experience is that an Englishman with an inherited German name is the
very last man to have any truck with the enemy. He is too much ashamed
of his forbears for one thing; and for another he is too dead set on
living down his beastly name. So we will rule out the Lieutenant
"R.N.R. My own man, who is a petty officer R.N.V.R., and has worked on"
"a lot of ships which have come in for repairs, says that the temper"
among the workmen in the yards is good now. It was ugly when dilution
"of labour first came in, but the wages are so high that all that"
trouble has settled down. I have had what you call sabotage in the
"shell and gun shops, but never yet in the King's ships. We have had"
"billet fell they heard a groaning, as though some one were wrestling"
"with death, and then the squall had passed."
"""Heaven be praised!"" said the crew--and the captain added: ""I am going"
"to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo."""
"""That's all very well, but we are not through yet,"" said the boy, ""there"
"is worse to come,"" and he told them to reef every last rag, as well as"
what had been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them with even
"greater force than the first, and was so vicious and violent that the"
"whole crew was frightened. While it was at its worst, the boy told them"
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw it over billet by
"billet, and took care not to take any from the third cord. When the last"
"billet fell, they again heard a deep groan, and then all was still. ""Now"
"there will be one more squall, and that will be the worst,"" said the"
"boy, and sent every one to his station. There was not a hawser loose on"
the whole ship.
The last squall hit them with far more force than either of the
"preceding ones, the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she"
"would not right herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck."
"But the boy told them to throw the last cord of wood overboard, billet"
"by billet, and no two billets at once. And when the last billet of wood"
"fell, they heard a deep groaning, as though some one were dying hard,"
"and when all was quiet once more, the whole sea was the color of blood,"
as far as eye could reach.
"When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters spoke of"
"writing to their wives. ""That is something you might just as well let"
"be,"" said the cabin-boy, ""seeing that you no longer have any wives."""
"""What will your prisoners get by way of punishment?"""
"""I am not sure, but I can guess pretty closely. The principal will go"
out suddenly early some morning. He is a Jew of uncertain Central
"European origin, Pole or Czech, a natural born British subject, a"
"shining light of a local anti-German society, an 'indispensable' in"
his job and exempted from military service. He will give no more
"trouble. Menteith will spend anything from seven to ten years in p.s.,"
"learn to do without his daily whisky bottle, and possibly come out a"
"decent citizen. The draughtsman, I expect, will be let off with"
"eighteen months of the Jug. We are just, but not harsh. My birds don't"
interest me much once they have been caught; it is the catching that I
"enjoy. Down in the south, where I have a home of my own--which I"
haven't seen during the past year except occasionally for an hour or
two--I used to grow big show chrysanthemums. All through the processes
"of rooting the cuttings, repotting, taking the buds, feeding up the"
"plants, I never could endure any one to touch them. But once the"
"flowers were fully developed, my wife could cut them as much as she"
pleased and fill the house with them. My job was done when I had got
the flowers perfect. It is just the same with my business. I cultivate
"the little dears I am after, and hate any one to interfere with me; I"
humour them and water them and feed them with opportunities till they
"are ripe, and then I stick out my hand and grab them. After that the"
"law can do what it likes with them; they ain't my concern any more."""
By this time it had become apparent even to my slow intelligence why
Dawson told me so much about himself and his methods. He had formed
"the central figure in a real story in print, and the glory of it"
"possessed him. He had tasted of the rich sweet wine of fame, and he"
thirsted for more of the same vintage. He never in so many words asked
"me to write this book, but his eagerness to play Dr. Johnson to my"
Boswell appeared in all our relations. He was communicative far beyond
"café. I felt its tremendous emphasis, and was content."
"Then, quite without warning, I caught my breath as my glance fell upon a"
girl dining with an old chap but three tables away. Among the habitués
of the Ritzes of two continents there could not have been found another
"like her, for never had I beheld a face as exquisite--and I've seen"
many. It possessed a beauty that left me helpless--yet there was an
indefinable sadness in it that might have suggested a haunting fear.
"One of the lights among the vines hung close to her, and I could see"
"these things. Even could I see the color of her eyes, deep purple"
eyes--the tone the wild iris takes at twilight. When she leaned one way
I might have thought the rich abundance of her hair contained spun
"copper or deep red gold, and again I would have sworn it matched the"
"mellow brown of chestnuts; in all forming an arrangement of waves, each"
"refusing to stay in place yet never really getting out of order, each"
coquetting with a subtle mischief that found an echo in her lips. Her
neck and shoulders were of that perfection that men realize but can not
"analyze; and her mouth, laughing or in repose, was maddening."
And there was an added charm quite apart from hair and eyes and lips.
"This I had never before seen in any face. Animation? Yes, and more."
"Interest in the life about her? Assuredly, to a very marked degree."
"Wildness? That was it!--a wildness, subtly blended with refinement, that"
found expression in every quick look; as if someone had put a fawn there
"from the forest and it was trying, half humorously, half confidently, to"
keep itself from running away in fright. It was this glory of wildness
that she typified which made my cheeks grow hot with watching.
"But who has ever made a picture worthy of his dreams! How, then, can I"
"describe this girl, when painter, sculptor, writer--all--would miserably"
fail at attempting to portray a beauty whereon imagination might gaze in
"riser,--also what he usually takes for dinner,--whether he drinks wine"
"or is a total abstainer, and at what hour he retires to rest. All this"
is so INTENSELY interesting to the public! Perhaps he might be inclined
"to give me a few notes of his recent tour in the East, and of course I"
"should be very glad if he will state his opinions on the climate,"
"customs, and governments of the countries through which he has passed."
"It's a great pity this is not his own house,--it is a pretty place and"
"a description of it would read well. Let me see!""--and she"
"meditated,--"" I think I could manage to insert a few lines about this"
"apartment, . . it would be easy to say 'the picturesque library in the"
"house of the Honble. Francis Villiers, where Mr. Alwyn received me,'"
"etc.,--Yes! that would do very well!--very well indeed! I should like"
"to know whether he has a residence of his own anywhere, and if not,"
"whether he intends to take one in London, because in the latter case it"
would be as well to ascertain by whom he intends to have it furnished.
A little discussion on upholstery is so specially fascinating to my
"readers! Then, naturally, I am desirous to learn how the erroneous"
"rumor of his death was first started, . . whether in the course of his"
"travels he met with some serious accident, or illness, which gave rise"
"to the report. Now,""--and she shut her note-book and folded her"
"hands,--""I don't mind waiting an hour or more if necessary,--but I am"
"sure if you will tell Mr. Alwyn who I am, and what I have come for, he"
"will be only too delighted to see me with as little delay as possible."""
"She ceased. Villiers drew a long breath,--his compressed lips parted in"
a slightly sarcastic smile. Squaring his shoulders with that peculiar
pugnacious gesture of his which always indicated to those who knew him
"well that his mind was made up, and that nothing would induce him to"
"alter it, he said in a tone of stiff civility:"
"""I am sorry, madam, . . very sorry! ... but I am compelled to inform"
you that your visit here is entirely useless! Were I to tell my friend
"to send her away. But the girl pleaded and cried, until at last she was"
allowed to remain.
"After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another journey, and she"
"forbade the girl, above all, to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she"
had not entered. And the girl promised her that this time she would obey
"her. But when she had been alone for some time, and had had all sorts"
"of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room, she could no"
longer resist opening the second door a little way--and swish! out flew
"the moon. When the foster-mother returned, and saw the moon had slipped"
"out, she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could keep her no"
"longer, and that now she must go. But when the girl again began to cry"
"bitterly, and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny"
"her, she was once more allowed to remain."
"After this the foster-mother wished to take another journey, and she"
"told the girl, who was now more than half-grown, that she must take"
"her request not to go, or even so much as peep into the third room,"
seriously to heart. But when the foster-mother had been away for some
"time, and the girl was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no"
"longer. ""O,"" thought she, ""how pleasant it would be to take a peep into"
"that third room!"" It is true, that at first she thought she would not do"
"it, because of her foster-mother; yet when the thought returned to her,"
"she could not hold back, after all; but decided that she should and"
must by all means take a peep. So she opened the door the least little
"bit--and swish! out flew the sun. When the foster-mother then returned,"
"and saw that the sun had flown out, she grieved greatly, and told"
the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer. The
foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before; but
"all to no avail. ""No, I must now punish you,"" said the foster-mother."
"""But you shall have your choice of either becoming the most beautiful"
"of all maidens, without the power of speech, or the most homely, yet"
Once upon a time there was a king who had several sons; I do not just
"know how many there were, but the youngest was not content at home,"
and insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune. And in
the end the king had to give him permission to do so. After he had
"wandered for a few days, he came to a giant's castle, and took service"
with the giant. In the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his
"goats, and when he started he told the king's son he was to clean the"
"stable in the meantime. ""And when you are through with that, you need"
"do nothing more for to-day, for you might as well know that you have"
"come to a kind master,"" said he. ""But you must do what you are told to"
"do conscientiously and, besides, you must not go into any of the rooms"
"that lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else your life"
"will pay the forfeit."""
"""He surely is a kind master,"" said the king's son to himself, walked up"
"and down the room, and whistled and sang; for, thought he, there would"
"be plenty of time to clean the stable. ""But it would be nice to take a"
"look at the other room, there surely must be something in it that he is"
"alarmed about, since I am not so much as to take a look,"" thought he,"
"and went into the first room. There hung a kettle, and it was boiling,"
"but the king's son could find no fire beneath it. ""What can there be in"
"it?"" thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at once the hair"
"grew just like copper. ""That's a fine soup, and whoever tastes it will"
"burn his mouth,"" said the youth, and went into the next room. There hung"
another kettle that bubbled and boiled; but there was no fire beneath
"it, either. ""I must try this one, too,"" said the king's son, and again"
"he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver. ""We have"
"no such expensive soup at home,"" said the king's son, ""but the main"
"thing is, how does it taste?"" and with that he went into the third room."
"And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling just like those in the"
"two other rooms, and the king's son wanted to try this one, too. He"
It may be we may theorise and attribute to the plants all the
characteristics of the animals; but that will be merely theory: there
will be no proof. There are certain classes of people who think that
plants are utterly unlike animals and some hold that they are like
animals. The mere theory is absolutely worthless in order to find out
"the truth. We have to find by investigation, by means of researches, by"
"means of proofs, that one is identical with the other. We have not only"
to drop all theory but we have to make the plant itself write down the
answers to the questions that we have to put to them. That was the great
"problem,--how to make the plant itself answer and write down answers to"
the question....
If the plants are acted on by various medicines and drugs like
"ourselves, then we can create an agent or a spokesman on which we can"
carry out all future investigations on the action of drugs. Then there
is opened out a great vista for the scientific study of medicine. And
let me tell you medicine is not yet an exact science. It is merely a
phase of tradition. We have not been able to make medicine scientific.
Now by the data of the influence of drugs on the fundamental basis of
"life, as is seen in the plant, we shall be able to make the science of"
medicine purely scientific.
"In travelling all over the world, which I have done several times, I was"
struck by two great characteristics of different nations. One
characteristic of certain nations is living for the future. All the
modern nations are striving to win force and power from nature. There is
"another class of men who live on the glory of the past. Now, what is to"
be the future of our nation? Are we to live only on the glory of the
"past and die off from the face of the earth, to show that we are worthy"
"descendants of the glorious past and to show by our work, by our"
intellect and by our service that we are not a decadent nation? We have
directly above us. I tried to analyse my feelings. If one finger is held
close to the middle of the forehead a curious sensation of strain seems
to gather in that spot. That was precisely the sensation I had at the
"back of my head and neck, only with far greater intensity. It was the"
"concentrated, agonizing consciousness of the swift descent of a huge"
iron mass that will strike the base of the head and blow the whole body
to pieces. In the region of the solar-plexus I had a feeling of
"oppression such as one often has before an examination, before jumping"
"into an icy river, before opening a letter that may contain bad news. I"
also breathed more heavily than usual. I made no attempt to master these
sensations. It occurred to me that fear is merely a physical reaction
that cannot be avoided. If a man reacts so violently that he is overcome
"and rushes about as though he were demented, it is no more his fault"
than if he shivers with cold. A man can stop shivering by an effort of
"the will, but only to a certain extent. And no effort of the will can"
"prevent him from feeling cold. In the same way, no effort of the will"
"can prevent him from feeling fear, and only to a limited extent can the"
"will control the outward manifestations of fear. Nevertheless, some"
"distraction may enable a man to forget his fear for a while, just as it"
may enable him to forget the cold. I was so intent upon self-analysis
"that I lost consciousness of everything except my mental concentration,"
"even of those sensations I was trying to analyse, for the very act of"
"analysis was destroying them. As they grew weaker, the effort of my will"
increased. It became so great that I grew conscious of great mental
tension and at the same time I realized that my fear had vanished
altogether. For a brief space I had a sensation of vacuity as though I
"could neither think nor feel. Then my mental effort suddenly collapsed,"
"I once more became aware of the droning overhead, and with a rush my"
former fears were upon me again. I pressed myself flat to earth. I heard
the descent of a bomb. I trembled and tried to shrink to nothing. There
was a deafening thunder-clap and the ground shook. A quantity of loose
earth came down upon us. Another bomb descended--every muscle in my body

Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"

You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"

"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I--
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head."
But I couldn't control my body.
I could see what I was doing.
But I couldn't stop.

"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."

Toss your oars up.
We should say goodbye.
"Once we sail, we won't have a chance to talk."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Goodbye, Harvey."
- Boat!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Mr. Crawford."
Boat ahoy!
"Captain's jolly boat coming alongside, sir."
- Full company aboard.
- Good.
This is Midshipman Crawford.
You must be proud to serve with your father.
Take the captain's son below and introduce him to his messmates.
Stand by to hoist.
Pass the word that Crawford is to be treated the same.
"Understood, sir."
Lots of women aboard.
"Wives, I reckon."
"Hello, my love."
Who are they?
Them?
They're the pressed men.
Follow me.
"Bye-bye, love."
Get those wretched women off!
- Hoist away!
- Dawlish!
Swing them over!
- Clear the deck!
"Okay, I will search for her."
I will also go to look around again.
I'm leaving first.
It's still my official duties.
Go there and look around.

Wait a minute.
I'm with the Seoul District Prosecutors Special Forces.
Prosecutor Kim Yeong Ju.

There has been too many impostors recently.
It's true.
But this time what are you working as?
This dress...
Not working anymore.
"I'm currently working as a country official, I'm afraid I can't say more."
A country official?
Can it be you're a police woman?
That is also a secret.
I'm in a hurry to find someone.
I'm sorry.
That...
"The woman who was with you the last time you interfered,"
Where did you take her?
Da Hye!
Do you know how to contact her?
Da Hye!
Da Hye!
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.

Her name is kalaya nirapattanassai.
She's a thai national.
"Hello, kalaya."
My name is James.
She doesn't speak much English.
Can we speak in private?
Why is she here?
She was arrested at the airport yesterday with 2 adult thai nationals who were smuggling heroin.
She was posing as the drug smugglers' daughter.
Where there any drugs found on her?
"No, she was just there to make it look like a family vacation."
To Pittsburgh.
Heh!
Not exactly a thai dream.
No wonder they got caught.
Where's she staying?
At a locked shelter for juvenile offenders.
But I don't understand why you're here.
I think she wants asylum.
[Slowly] Do you speak any English?

Haunted hotels...

Quite popular apparently?
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!

"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."

You never needed anybody.

No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."

This movie's awesome.
You must be the last person on earth who has never seen Psycho.
Spoiler alert:
It's gonna scare the crap out of you.
"Holly, if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm a pretty tough..."
Aah!
That wasn't even scary.
"Yeah, but look where it got me."
"Hey, guys."
Hope I'm not interrupting.
"- Actually, uh..."
- 'Cause I gotta talk to Holly
- about something important.
"- What's going on, Phil?"
Is this shirt too tight?
"No, it leaves just the right amount to the imagination."
Is that kung pao chicken?
"Oh, stop drooling."
Sit down.
"I couldn't, I couldn't."
Not without a glass of wine.
So what are we watching?
"Wow, Psycho?"
- Uh-huh.
"- Oh, I love it."
"Get out the shower, girl!"
Get out the shower!
"F.Y.I., he'll be doing that the entire movie."
Yippee.
"Hey, Holly."

Yeah.
"Man, what about her?"
Have you seen her?
"Long gone, bro."
She hasn't danced here in months.
You know where she is?
"Last time I saw you, you wanted to punch my face in."
You remember that?
- Vaguely.
- It was that chick.
Zoe.

"No, baby."
"No, I told you to run!"
You gotta run!

It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
[SIGHING] I knew him.
How'd he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
-That's where--
-Where the chick got swirlied to death.
"So, what, this ghost is possessing nerds?"
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"

And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
"I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry."
Damon.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry I'm late.
"The dog ate my, uh..."
Never mind.
- What's with all the furrowed brows?
- I saw Isobel last night.
Isobel's here?
In town?
- You're late.
JOHN:
Didn't realize I was on a schedule.
What's with the sideshow?
ISOBEL:
Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.
And I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
- He's gay?
- Not right now.
He's very good to me.
"Hey, Cherie?"
[ISOBEL SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
I'm teaching them French.
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
"Madam, nobody has arrested you."
Now please go home.
"If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police."
"Very well, then."
Where would I get a Mickey Finn?
I haven't the faintest idea.
"There you are, you see?"
"Come, Cedric."
What are you waiting for?
Come along.
"Ethel, come on!"
"Sergeant, where would one get a Mickey Finn?"
"I haven't the faintest idea, sir."
(Creaks)
- Good evening.
- (Gasps)
Must you keep jumping out?
You seem to have jumped in.
What on earth...?
- I...
I got caught in a storm.
- It hasn't been raining.
It was raining where I was.
Cats and dogs.
"- And mud, I see."
"- Yes, I must brush that off."
"By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning."
Really?
Which one?
I mean...
What do you mean?
She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise, you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"""Snow..."
"""Beard..."
"Grace."""
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
"In the woods."""
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
Slut?
"""Kim""?"
You have her number programmed into your cell phone?
- Who is this dirty whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- Who is this fucking whore?
- I didn't sleep with her!
- No.
"But you wanted to, right?"
- No!
- Bullshit.
Is she prettier than me?
- No!
- Liar!
"- No, Jen!"
"What am I supposed to do now, huh?"
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
You've ruined everything!
Will you listen to me?
Nothing happened!
Nothing?
You kissed her.
You were out with another woman all night.
I'm pregnant.
- Is that fucking nothing to you?
- Yes!
No!
How many times did you kiss her?
Don't you dare lie to me.
Several times.
"Oh, God, you make me sick!"
"But it didn't mean anything, baby."
"You're here about Ben, of course."
What about Ben?
-Ben Haverman.
"This morning, the newspaper said he had died."
"Out of the blue, it said."
That must have been our Ben.
"Bronze Lion, ex assault group member, it has to be him."
"Yes, it's Ben."
Oh God.
Out of the blue.
Was it his heart?
Are you going to the cremation?
"-No, I have to do something else."
You?
"-Well, so many people are dying."
Fantastic garden.
"-Yes, it's my pride and joy."
It takes a lot of time.
They're beautiful I've never seen them before.
Which ones exactly?
-The pink ones.
I've got those from Israel.
The children brought them for me.
Nice holiday present.
-They live there.
Have a seat.
"Yes, they're three very tough rascals."
They participate in every war.
"Syria, Jordan, Egypt, you name it."
They've got that from you.
They're real American Jews.
Very fanatical.
Forbidden!
Officer!
This wheel didn't understand ifs forbidden area!
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
Now you come down and give it to me!
I can't come down!
It's forbidden!
Go.
So I am coming in by myself to pick it up then I will go!
Are you going to come in?
!
It is forbidden.
No way!
Go.
Go.
So I would bowstring to get it.
"It's not forbidden for this rope, is it?"
Where are you from?
Bushehr_
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
Tangak!
- Where are you going?
- I am just gonna get some water.
It's out of water then
That's it.
There is no water inside it.
Okay.
Akan is taking the girl to his building.
Shit.
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
What the fuck have you done?
All our girls are dead!
"- Okay, ladies..."
- Okay?
"- Alright, just..."
- It ain't fucking okay!
- Who were those guys?
- What do you mean alright?
- He is telling us to relax?
- Are you telling us to relax?
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
- You saw what happened up there?
"- Sorry you are upset, okay?"
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Henry and I are going to do with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
- Did you see what happened upstairs?
- Did you see what you did?
- We'll go with you to destroy them!
- That fag white hair is dead.
You wanna go on a bike?
You can go on a bike.
Just...
You wanna go?
"- Okay, go on your bike, yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
"- He's like this genius, super secretive."
- Okay.
"And apparently, they're working on this new project."
Big money involved.
Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi."
Um...
Just Cooper.
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine.
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Follow me.
"- Oh, yeah."
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that."
"Okay, great."
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.
Really nice name.
Thank you.
- Ozone Overseas.
It's a small company.
Maybe you have heard the name.
Your style of calling a big company small..
..and thus calling yourself big is great.
"You are late, Mr. Bajaj."
Umbrella Creations' conference is over.
It doesn't make any difference.
He is a victim of overconfidence.
He thinks he is going to get Umbrella Creations' order.
"Continue dreaming, Mr. Bajaj."
This time we will get the order.
Okay.
"Anyway, see you."
- Sure.
All the best.
See you.
- Bye.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
'Because she loves sex as much as I do.
Okay?

"'Sex is just an activity to you, isn't it?"

Let's utilize our Sunday.
Let's rearrange the furniture.
Actually.
"Come on, Gul."
Let's do it.
You've spent too long with lesser species.
The trash out on the housing estates.
"The dole scum, the layabouts."
Werewolves.
Come with me.
"- No, I'm actually tired."
I'm really...
"- Oh, hush now."
It's time for you to claim your heritage.
As a vampire and as a man.
"Now, who do we have in here?"
"Everybody, this is our boy..."
Adam.
These will be your kind of people now.
Melvyn there is a dentist.
Simon.
And... oh.
You're Sue?
"Hi, Sue."
They work in local government.
"And, er... oh, Tina and Liam run a garden centre."
"- There, see?"
Shall we go upstairs?
"- Please, yeah."
Mm-hm.
This way.
Hello?
It sounds like a party.
"Oh, well, maybe we should come back tomorrow."
"I mean, throwing him a party's not exactly mistreatment."
"Yeah, a vampire party."
Who knows what that involves?
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

What?
I'm trying to sleep.
- I'm just making conversation.
No one else in this house likes me.
At least I can talk to you.
- Especially if you need someone to talk to.
JENNA:
"Oh, please, I'm eating."
"So seriously, how well do you know Anna?"
I know Anna extremely well.
Uh-huh.
"Well, know that you can talk to me about anything."
I'm here to answer any questions that you have to help you in any way I can.
Why?
Because your dad would want me to.
"I'm, uh..."
I'm good.
"Uh-oh, Cherie."
You won again.
Hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
Tonight's just one blast from the past after another.
"- No, no, no."
DAMON:
Mm.

DAMON:
Mm.
"It's good to see you, Isobel."
Just having fun with your naughty little minion.
ISOBEL:
Mm.
How'd you find me?
I searched all the bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
"Oh, I should have known."
I understand what you said.
He's talented.

What did you hear about that thing?
What thing?
The Brooklyn thing?
"No, no."
The guy from downtown.
"The guy there from where Christie used to live, there?"
"The guy who disappeared up the block from Christie, the one they made the beef on."
You know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everybody crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened to him.
He came into the joint that one night and then he just disappeared.
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."

"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"

We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
- Sure!
"- Clean-up time, Jocelyn."
"Jocelyn, how are you doing?"
Where have you been?
"Hi, Nate, I need to pick up Sebastian's packages."
Really?
What are his packages:
Big or small?
It's his luggage from the trip to St. Bart.
It's that stuff back there.
"It's too big for you, Jocelyn."
We'll take it up.
- Thanks.
- While you're here...
- do you think you can help us out?
- Sure.
What is it?
We found this package outside our door this morning...
But it didn't have no telephone extention or return number.
"So we took it to the 4th, Time Square, but..."
- That's Conde Nest.
- Yeah.
"It was addressed to an Andre Leon Talley, but..."
Andre Leon Talley?
Let me see this.
"I don't even know where it came from, what can I do with it?"
I'll take it.
Thanks!
"Slow down, punter foot."
This isn't Sports Ilustrated.
Look what I just found in the messenger center.
- Where did you get this?
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.

"Oh, Bill!"

I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.

And it was on early.
How early?
Mike?
"wakey, wakey."
"But then, everything changed."
Hey.
Hey.
See my show?
"Oh, I meant to watch it."
"I just got so busy with the whole ""being sound asleep"" thing."
"It took all night, eight hours down the drain."
"Oh, it's fine."
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi.
Are you Robin?
Yeah.
"I'm Don, your new co-host."
"Don was Don Frank, seasoned veteran of no fewer than 39 local morning news teams from all over the country."

Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!

From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.

The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
- Faiz!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Are you fine?
What have you done?
Jumped from the vehicle?
What if something happened?
Nothing will happen to me.
I thought I would be separated from you.
I could never bear that separation.
And I jumped!
"Tell me brother, do you need some help?"
"Can we get a place to stay, somewhere?"
A place to stay?
It's some distance from here.
It's difficult to find transport here.
"Sit on my bike, I shall leave you there."
I am going that way.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Come on!
"- Okay, come!"
"Go inside, there is place to stay here."
Okay!
Thanks!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
- Sheen!
- Look how beautiful it is.
But there is no one here!
Can't find anyone.
Let's look inside.
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?
Coming up...
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
...Our competition for tips on the streets of San Francisco takes a strange turn.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.

"And later, Rutledge makes a scientific breakthrough."
"Oh, come on!"
You unplugged it!
Ferrara:
"To celebrate our 25th episode, we've turned over control of the show to Rutledge."
I've got Wood.
"So far, he almost killed himself."
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Bleep]
And now he had me working the streets of San Francisco for tips.
Andrew?
I had $40 to Rut's $20.
Pow!
Yeah!
And we had our last passengers of the night.
I want to know more about this boy that you say you like.
I'm not sure about this.
He was really nice.
- I don't know.
- He was nice.
I thought he was nice.
Really?
You don't like him 'cause he's chubby and nerdy.
No.
That's not true.
The funeral's over?
"Well, yeah, it happened."
We're getting married.
I told you you look good together.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now that Nana quit and Yoon-sung's gone...
The Blue House is so boring.
You said all you needed was me to be happy and...
This is why one shouldn't propose too soon.
Take it.
"Mine, too."
Da-hye.
It's OK if you're too busy to come to the wedding.
I'll text you my account number.
I wish you health and happiness.
Choi Eung-chan.
"Be happy, Eun-ah."
"Ma am, how about... we open a restaurant in the States?"
We can name it Delicious Korean.
What did the ex-president say?
"He's sorry, grateful, and he wished me happiness."
You know...
I was a chef on a ship once.
I love Korean food.
It's amazing.
The Americans need to taste my food.
I'll be famous.

Thank you for watching City Hunter.
- Well ...
It's because of the surgery.
Do you think?
Yes.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you had undergone such an operation?
I don't know.
She is not like our mother.
Play it again.
Loads of kisses from me.
I can't wait to be back.
Pull up your blankets and close your eyes.
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them with eyes that never doze.

He sees you and loves you.
Goodnight.
Get mom.
Mom?
Lukas?
Lukas?
- Hello?
"- Hi, good morning."
That was a huge order.
So many at the same time.
- Throwing a party?
- No.
Who are all those pizzas for?
"Pepperoni, Pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"""May He who makes peace in His Heaven make peace upon us and upon all Israel,"
"""and let us say amen."""
- Amen.
"Thanks, honey."
Not a word to Raziya.
"Okay, honey."
"If you ask me, Mom was a spy."
"She grew up in Algeria, right?"
- And she visited Aunt Rosa in Paris once a year?
- Yeah.
She met an Algerian spy there who she knew from childhood and brought the secrets to Dad.
Do the math.
Dad was in Intelligence.
- He was a cook in Intelligence.
- That was his cover story.
So the Algerian spy got her pregnant?
- Maybe he was an Arab.
- God forbid.
Maybe she was the spy.
Or a murderer.
Ever see her kitchen cleaver?
- I know.
She was a Nazi hunter.
- What?
Then why did she take us on a heritage tour of Oschwitz?
Since when did she have family in Oschwitz?
It was an educational tour.
We're Jews.
"Unless your father is a little Arab spy,"
- which makes you...
Some of the kids at school told the police...
-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.
-Yeah.
But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.
The school.
-What?
"-Truman High, home of the Bombers."
"I know with our history, you'll think I made this up--"
"Andy, what?"
"Now, an incident has occurred at my apartment. lt's not fit for visitors."
-l don't believe this.
-You wanna know what happened?
-No.
"-Hey, John, good morning."
"I've heard about fungus in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--"
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?
What happened?
"Well, I have a very bad gas leak."
"Now, I called the gas people."
There is no way I'm gonna feel comfortable exposing you to danger.
-We're back to square one?
-We are definitely not at square one.
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a changed man. I have a dangerous leak.
"That's all we're talking about here, now."
"You want some advice, Andy?"
Get it fixed.
WOMAN:
Mike?
Roberts?
-Mike Roberts around?
I gotta see Mike.
DONNA:
He's not here.
Mike?
"-Hey, Roberts."
-Excuse me.
What's wrong with you?
"Man, where the gefilte fish at?"
It's in the fridge.
That shit's perishable once it's open.
"They ain't in the fridge, man."
"Hold on, man, I know I put that shit in the fridge 'cause don't nobody want no hot-ass gefilte fish."
"Just like I said, right behind the peanut butter."
"Ain't no peanut butter in here, man, just yogurt."
"- Where the fuck are you, Ricky?"
"- Where you think I am, man?"
"I'm in the motherfucking kitchen, bro."
I'm in the kitchen.
I don't see your ass.
"Hey, man."
"Oh, God!"
"Yo, TTD, call the cops."
There's a weird white kid in our house.
"What house are you in, Rick?"
- Ricky?
- Uh...
- Ricky?
"- Oh, shit."
- Ricky.
- Boy:
"I know who you are, asshole."
- You're not gonna get away with this.
"- TTD, call Spencer."
( car alarm chirps )
"Wayne, Wayne!"
( panting ) Wayne!
"Well, look what the breeze finally blew in."
"Better late than never, though, right?"
Who is it?
It's Gargan.
Long distance.
- Huh?
- Gargan.
- At this hour?
- Yeah.
"Hello, Mr. Gargan."
"Oh, listen, Thompson, I'm gonna be out of the state for a week or 10 days."
"Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Gargan."
We'll miss you.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
"But listen, I gotta make a business trip."
"When I come back, I'm gonna have a conference with the governor."
- You get me?
"- Sure, I understand, Mr. Gargan."
"I don't know how long it's gonna take me but meanwhile, I want you to get this straight."
I want everything run just exactly as I left it.
No changes.
"If there's any argument, whatever Miss Griffith decides, goes."
You understand?
- Is she around there now?
- No.
"I think she's in her cottage, Mr. Gargan, I could get her for you if--"
"No, no, that's all right."
Never mind.
Just tell her I called.
"Yeah, so long."
"And remember, no changes."
"All right, Mr. Gargan."
"Yeah, I understand."
- Hello.
"- Hey, baby."
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Fucking psycho.
Where's Marie?
Who?
You know who.
Marie is my waitress.
My!
You're chatty tonight.
"Darling, I'm your waitress!"
What's going on here?
I've never seen you before.
What are you talking about?
"You come in here every night, sitting on that same stool, staring at your coffee."
"To be honest, I was starting to think that you were a mute."
I wanna see Maria!
"Mister, there's no Maria that works here."
Is everybody in it?
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.
"Whatever Ivan was paying you, he's wasting his money."
"Go home, Mister."
Get some sleep.
Don't forget your post-its.
"Christ, Stevie."
How could you!
Nicholas?
"You'll have to pay your utility bills, partner."
You know how difficult it is shaving' in the dark.
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
"Once the transplantation is done,"
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
"Thanks for being there, Vikram."
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?
!
Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
"Start, start..."
Go closer!
Follow them.
"You, moron!"
We have to take the other route now.
Move...
- Idiot.
- We lost them!
"Panju, call Alphonse."
I'm not able to reach him.
Bye.
"I love you, and nothing's gonna go wrong."
I won't let it.
"You understand, Diane?"
I won't let it.
"I love you, Bobby."
Hey.
[ Chuckles ]
I have to get back to the club.
Hey.
"Come on, now."
"You don't want me to be late on the night I'm gonna elope, do you?"
"Diane, why do you have to go?"
Why can't we just get out-- Bobby.
"Bobby, I have to go back to the club."
"If I don't, Jessie'll be suspicious."
"Don't you worry, honey."
No man is ever gonna lay a hand on me again except you.
I swear it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.

"[ Car Radio: ""Moonlight Serenade'""]"
Do you want my jacket?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
"Come on, honey."

This was brutal.
"Marshal, could it be White Tiger?"
- According to my calculations...
"- Not him, right?"
- Could be.
"- Yes, yes."
- After serious consideration...
- It's him.
Not him.
The Marshal is right.
I came from the North to GuangZhou just to catch White Tiger.
Minor cases like this should be settled at your level.
"If you don't solve this, you'll come to regret it."
I'll regret it!
"Marshal, Marshal!"
"Marshal, you're here all the way from the North."
Come for dinner tomorrow.
- OK.
"- Please, please, please..."
"Sifu Tam, we haven't been asked to perform our lion dance at the start."
Why not?
They asked Wong Fei-hung.
Wong Fei-hung again?
His birthday's in a few days.
"Junior, deliver a birthday robe to him."
He'll like the robe I make him.
"Foon, it's my birthday in a few days."
Are we ready?
"- Yes, Sifu."
I don't recognize anybody's voice.
Don't make any mistakes here or do anything stupid.
Don't tell me how to live my life.
- Cut them loose.
- All right.
OFFICER:
"All right, this way out."
MARTINEZ:
Let's go.
[DOOR OPENS]
"- Hey, Greg."
"- Hey, John."
KELLY:
How you feeling?
MEDAVOY:
Okay.
"You know, all right."
John....
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.
"John, when you got separated, did you give that a lot of thought?"
"Did you have it pretty well worked- out, what you were going to do?"
- It was her call.
- It was Laurie's idea?
Yeah.
"For me, you marry, you marry for life."
Me too.
"You know, that's exactly me too."
"But when it happened I was so busy being pissed off and hurt, I wasn't listening."
She was trying to tell me why she wanted to leave.
But you know what?
She was right.
What else?
"Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable."
-You won't score points by telling her.
-Okay.
Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts.
She doesn't need your life story...
-... beforeyougetthe salad.
-Got it.
"As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all."
"Right, right."
"I'll be cool, aloof, distant."
"She's here, she's here, she's here!"
What about the-
- What-
- What--
What about the kiss goodnight?
-Should I ask or just go for it?
-Go for it.
Don't wait until the last minute.
It creates pressure.
-Get it out of the way early.
-How early?
"After dinner, when you walk to the car..."
"... openherdoor,waitforher to say thank you..."
"... smile,leanin ,andkissher."
"Oh, nice."
"Hi, Alan."
You ready?
"You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you."
That's another way to go.
-Madam.
-Thank you.
Do you understand?
"May your knowledge rain upon Toni's bar, so the seeds of education and prosperity take root."
What do you want?
I saw mom in the supermarket.
- Attention!
Report to 08...
- Supermarket...
The last time I heard from her she was in Sweden.
That was the end of the seventies.
What would she be doing in a supermarket around here?
What do I know?
You imagined it.
Why would she suddenly just show up here?
Sweden is much too far away for a short visit.
But suppose I did see her.
You've got her mixed up.
I didn't get her mixed up.
Do you hear that?
"This singing, you hear that?"
Isn't that great?
It' s been going on for days.
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
You'll get the file in the morning.
Alright?
Fine.
Shouldn't I come with you?
It's not necessary.
Too bad!
"A 1,000 Euro show."
"How come 1,000 Euros?"
What were you thinking?
Toni's 999 Euro show?

Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.

What is the reason that you're doing this?
"Xiaotian, I love you!"
I'll wait for you!
Yawang!
Mother!
Father!
How is it?
Was it hard?
- Yes.

"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."
"You have entered the university that you want,"

Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!

Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.

All this time!

Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.

- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
"I know what Anna is, and I know that you know."
"So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?"
No.
"But, Jer..."
"Jeremy, wait."
Jeremy.
[SIGHS THEN GASPS]
Isobel.
- What are you doing here?
"- I'm your mother, Elena."
I wanna be more involved in your life.
- I don't want you in my life.
- I understand that.
You already have a lot of people you care about.
But I've been studying.
Let's see if I got this right.
"There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie."
Gonna stay away from that one.
"The sad little brother, Jeremy."
And there's Caroline.
Obnoxious Caroline.
"I got all of my info from her, by the way."
"She had no idea who I was, and she wouldn't stop yapping."
Aww.
And there's Matt.
"Friend, ex, Yappy's future ex."
Lots of connections there.
- Matt's not involved in this.
"- He's involved with you, isn't he?"
"Look, you shouldn't be here."
You need to leave.
No.
I believe that my prayers will be heard there!
How can the medicine work when you are hungry?
Are you hungry?
You are starving for last two days.
And you claim that you are not hungry?
I wiIIjust come back.
"O God, I have looked for him everywhere!"
But I couldnt find him.
I dont know how he is doing now.
"God, you have bestowed me with everything."
But without him its useless!
"God, I want to find him!"
"Yes, I do!"
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
"Brother, please sit down."
Mr. Kirshna is going to serve the offering!
Master!
Master!
"What happened to you, sir?"
What happened to you?
"Krishna, ourfate betrayed.."
..us once you left us!
I lost everything!
Your madam also left me!
"Yeah, I know!"
I know!
"Sir, I know all of it."
You have met me after such a Iong time!
Master!
How is little miss?
He is Krishna!
Lamaze.
Is that where they do the breathing that ease the pain?
"Yeah, it actually works."
"You know, you breathe fast and then slow, you know, like..."
"I don't know, like-- like a dog or something."
I wouldn't touch that line with a road crew tour bus.
Do you remember everything you've ever touched?
I'm just saying.
"Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure."
"Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?"
Take care of yourself.
"All right, Morgan--"
All right.
Later.
"All right, everybody in."
Come on.
"Come on, let's go."
Ante up.
Ante up.
"""Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through."

Joe Walsh.
Hey.
"Hey, beautiful."
How was the poker game?
Mmm.
Ah.
Broke even.
Oh.
But...
This little one chillin' inside your beautiful belly didn't do so badly.
Whatever that means.
"Irene Bentley, I'm arresting you under suspicion of assisting an offender."
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man recently?
No.
"Thank you, sir."
Yes?
"- Excuse me, sir."
My name's DC Ashton...
No.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man before?
"- No, sorry."
- Sure?
"Yeah, I'm sure."
I didn't know you were back.
We've brought in Renee Bentley.
I came back to join the manhunt... but I've just been sat in here for half an hour.
You need to see this.
Hudson and I found it in the Bentley lock-up.
It matches the bracelet Julie-Ann was wearing when she died.
"Yes, sir."
Understood.
Absolutely.
"Thank you, sir."
Super's finished the next-of-kin visit.
Think I'm gonna head off and see 'em myself.
Could you pass these on?
"It's the Guv's watch and wallet, and his warrant card."
"- Sarge, if you need a WPC..."
- Tennison...
"Like you said, I need to keep busy."
It's his wife and kids.
And to determine the degree of infiltration.
-Infiltration by whom?
-Alpha Draconians.
-Draconians?
Jaelen!
"Jaelen, what's happened?"
Jaelen...
"-They took it, Robert."
They took our baby.
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.
-It's safer.
- Our army is coming here to establish complete dominion.
It has always been our intent to shield you from this threat.
But we are entrenched in war and we haven't the means to bring the fleet here to protect you.
It is to be your darkest age.
"- Man, look at that."
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's amazing.
-Open that one.
-Wow.
-Open that one.
That's amazing.
Wow.
- We're gonna set the world on fire with this.
-And I think soon.
"- There, I got it."
"- Dude, we got a helicopter."
Right behind there.
See?
- Hold on.
- What?
I hope this is the fever talking.
This lack of compassion and tolerance is very disappointing.
- That is not the little girl I raised.
- You guys are disgusting.
What was that?
"I told you, we should've had more Jewish friends."
[Whispers] You never told me that.
"Yeah, you suck!"
We're friends of the Jewish people!
- We don't have any.
- We've got a couple.
"No, not one."
Nick is half Jewish.
Who's Nick?
Man: ♪ Somewhere behind the mountains ♪
♪ There is a place I figured out... ♪

[Whirring sound]
"Vanessa, hey, it's Nate."
"I need to... oh, shit, this guy is rich."
"Hey, uh, uh, I need to know if you sent that product, okay?"
"It's very important you call me, so pull your head out of that big mound of coke and..."
- [Beeps]
- Hold on a sec.
I think this is you.
Hello?
- [Laughing]
- Hello?
Vanessa?
"So you still coming down to Fort Lauderdale,"
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.
Just set up.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Exports.
Imports.
Portugal.
"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
What?
What?
"Ah Eiji, sorry to keep you waiting."
That Echizen sure is slow.
Get someone to bring him here.
Why don't you go?
Why me?
"Damn late, Echizen!"
"Ah, my apologies."
You see we are not open for business today.
"Ah, dozo."
Sorry about it.
- Come back tomorrow.
- But they're eating...
But they're eating...
"No, no, no."
That is just a minor incident.
Don't worry about it.
Carry on.
It is okay.
It's okay.
- Taka-san.
- Yes?
Good accuracy.
What about Higaki?
Don't worry.
There's a reason to make Higaki lose.
To control him better.
If this carries on it might lead to the damage of your whole body.
Rest for a year without playing tennis.
Concentrate on your therapy.
Wait till the National Finals.
He doesn't mix with dirty Arabs like you!
Dirty Arabs?
Reminds me of waterboarding.
You got a bathtub in here?
Buildings and Investments operate through the Pole Pot Bank.
"Forget the bank, I want the banker!"
"Apart from banking, what does the banker do?"
Walk his dachshund through the park?
Rare?
Medium?
Well done?
Overdone?
The theater.
He took a shine to some piss pot actress.
Care to impart her pseudonym?
Aglaé.
Gla Gla!
That tip would have saved your hide.
"Unfortunately, I have a kiss from Mary."
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing!
Why do I make a show of it?
Because... you're my friend.
"You know what I feel, right now, here?"
I'll tell you.
I'm gonna barf.
What am I good for?
Nothing gives.
Makes a void inside.
You got religion?
No!
Here.
But those days are done.
- Oh.
- Mm.
Huh.
"Well, I guess I'm not in control of everything, am I?"
"Funny, isn't it?"
"You can try and try, but in the blink of an eye..."
You can lose everything that matters to you.
"Dad, are you okay?"
Don't you all see what's going on here?
Dad really wanted that milk.
I almost lost you guys today...
All of you.
- Aw.
- Just like that.
"Aw, daddy."
"Oh, honey."
"You spent the whole day trying to control everything, and I spent the entire day trying not to, and neither way worked, did it?"
Nope.
"I may fight you on this, but I'm gonna need you to make me get rid of Jolene two."
- She's a biter.
- I know.
As soon as we're done with this hug.
"Hey, whatever this is, I need to get in on it."
I almost died today.
- Grandpa.
- Daddy.
"- Aw, dad."
- Hey.
Come here.
- Aww.
"- Come here, you."
"I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy."
Heather!
Daddy does those things to Mommy.
Okay.
Yeah.
_
Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.
How am I supposed to know that?
"I know, it's gonna be so much easier when she can talk."
"Like, we won't feel like we're, like, on a Japanese game show we don't know the rules to."
Hey.
- Is that Sam?
- Yeah.
"Hey, Sam, what's up?"
"Hey, Uncle Greg."
"Move, you're blocking the view."
"Oh, of what?"
"Oh, the security guard stuck against the wall on a Segway?"
"No, we're spying on my boyfriend."
You have a boyfriend?
Irving Rosenblatt... he's the coolest boy in the class.
He's been acting weird.
I'm not even sure if we're boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
He liked three of Lexie's pictures on Instagram.
"Oh, I hate her."
Unless you're Lexie.
"No, I'm Jenna."
Lexie's a monster.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.
[Laughs]
[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
It won an Oscar.
Rocky IV has Stallone in it... and he bashes a Russian's face to all smithereens.
"Lifting anvils and shit, and pulling trucks through the snow."
Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.
- Girls can't fight.
They don't have muscles.
- It's true.
"Okay, that is a horribly sexist thing to say."
It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.
"In park, but no emergency brake."
Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.
You look beautiful tonight.
I'm not just saying that.
You really do.
I heard you.
Why don't you have some coffee?
I'll go find Claire.
"Claire, where have you been?"
Alex is looking for you.
"- Oh, brother, it's starting already?"
- Come on.
How could you do this?
I may never forgive you.
I may never forgive you.
That's another story.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes!
- I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.
I'm calling about the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?
"No, this is her sister."
Rose doesn't even know I answered the ad.
"Well, then maybe we shouldn't be talking."
No!
"Please, it's just that Rose would never answer an ad herself."
"I mean, some of these guys are such creeps and losers."
"But when it said you taught at Columbia, something just clicked inside."
"- You have seen her picture, right?"
- Yes.
- And?
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.
She's also dating an astronaut.
Wow.
That's very impressive.
Yeah.
"But Leonard's impressive, too."
Thank you.
"""Befuddled."""
"The word I was looking for was ""befuddled."""
Knight to old woman... six-and-a-third.
Brilliant move.
Thank you.
Will the two of you excuse me?
I need a hug.
"Sorry, I have company."
"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
I don't want to hug you.
"I don't want to hug you, either."
I was just feeling blue.
"Blue, as in depressed."
"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
I don't know what color lonely is.
- What?
- Red is angry;
yellow is frightened;
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.
All right.
It's all right.
What are you talking about?
"Baby, you just hit a home run"
On your very first try!
I think you're actually the first kid in history
To ever do that.
"come on, you have to be a little bit excited."
Did you see those parents' faces?
Everybody was like-- they were screaming!
I was screaming!
It was so good!
We have to do my family tree.
"No, that's not due for another week."
It's due tomorrow.
No.
"No, it's due on the--"
"The 27th, i think."
"I put it in my calendar, 'cause i didn't wanna forget that..."
"Oh, fuck."
What did you say?
Nothing.
Sorry.
are you fucking kidding me?
Hey.
God.
Hey!
Thank you so much.
Do not worry.
We've got this.
"Please, when abigail was little,"
I used to get everything late.
That's fine.
Drink it in.
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.
"I know, right?"
"All right, boys."
Your turn.
Let 'em dangle.
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.
Count of three?
One.
"Two, three."
"You guys are awesome, man!"
That's not even necessary.
- Would you please--
"- Oh, my dick!"
My dick cost a late-night fee
Your dick got the HIV
My dick plays on the double feature screen
Your dick went straight to DVD
My dick bigger than a bridge
Your dick look like a little kid's
"My dick large like the Chargers, the whole team"
Your shit look like you 14
"My dick locked in a cage, right"
Your dick suffer from stage fright
My dick so hot it's stolen
Your dick look like Gary Coleman
My dick pink and big
- This car is frickin' sweet.
"- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet."
'Cause we're fugitives.
See.
He's back to save his brother.
A little longer and... his brother would've been crippled like his father.
Speak up.
What's your answer?
He abused you father.
Satyakant.
Better teach your son... before teaching Dharam kunj.
Start teaching about right and wrong at home.
Look.
Look how cruelly he's been beaten up.
Only a thug or goon can beat someone like this.
You seem to know a lot about goons.
What do you want to say?
Am I a goon?
Your son's action justifies that.
Surya!
Forth first time...
I hit someone.
That too my son.
You will never hit anyone again.
I... apologise...
On behalf of my son.
Let's go!
This boy has humiliated Satyakant's honor.
I'll handle him.
Satyakant!
Satyakant!
Brother.
Shiv.
He abused father.
I can endure anything in life.
Is he in an athletic tank?
"""An athletic tank""?"
Yeah.
"I believe that's the nice way of saying ""wifebeater."""
"That's the new way of saying the ""W. B.""?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Where I'm from, they call them wifebeaters because everyone on ""cops"" was wearing those."
"That's... by the way, everyone calls them wifebeaters."
Okay.
What's the new thing...
"""Athletic tank""?"
"""Athletic tank"" is what it says on the package."
[ Laughter ] Is that a network...
"So, if a guy had, let's say, a classic land cruiser, what would you think?"
I love that car.
Like FJ40?
Yes.
I had one.
Really?
Is it for sale?
The last one I can think of...
And this is just off the top of my head...
"A guy with, say, a 1983 Honda Civic Wagon?"
Just picked that out of thin air.
Ah...
Totally redone.
No.
Right.
Interior/exterior?
"Yeah, plaid interior."
Plaid?
Sorry.
Change of plans.
We'll take it from here.
[âª]
(syd:) thanks.
Got a knife?
His contact probably has the key to that.
"(andreas:) no, I do."
[âª] [sirens]
I don't think anyone followed us.
What's the combination?
0-5-0.
All the numbers left to right.
"Once we get this thing open,"
I have a few questions for you.
Like where you get your information.
Oh my god.
{ Advertisement }
"(syd:)you're the answer man, watson."
I don't know.
You don't know?
This wasn't in my information.
Did you dial the numbers correctly?
Yes.
I don't suppose you have the number
For a bomb disposal unit?
Alright.
We can't just leave the map here.
A man who worked for
My father's construction company
Showed me how to do this once.
Defuse a bomb?
"I'm leaving, after all."
But you're watching me climb down the stairs.
"But you saw aunt go upstairs, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see her going downstairs.
Right?
Err?
"Right, all right."
"You'd rather take the left, and forget the right."
Listen to me...
Yes?
I have something important to discuss with you.
About the rent?
Forget the rent!
Forget it?
Really?
Sure.
But I have a condition.
You must do something for me.
What is it?
You know I've been alone since my wife died 20 years ago.
I've never missed female company earlier...
I've heard that one before!
Damn these rickshaw-drivers!
Now listen carefully...
I always do.
That woman and I...
Which woman?
Laxmi...
I see my wife Mangala in her!
"She has the same eyes, same features... same gait!"
I swear!
This is an action replay!
What happens to you?
The Toilet!
Sight which is to do by a friend.
"At least, we will help him to throw it."
What goes.
It is the love.
Sandokan.
Tiger of Malaysia.
"make case, wake up."
What happens?
I go to take a sample of urine for the analyses.
They have already taken it this morning.
"-New analyses, ""Wasserman""."
-Wasserman?
"Yes, they are things that happen if it is not had well-taken care of."
And if we made a cocktail?
"Yes, therefore we will give him a lesson."
To prepare.
-Benito!
-God.?
Who is?
"To your age, still beams those things?"
"Good, in fact..."
General extraction of urine.
To prepare.
It advanced.
Sr. Santarelli.
-What happens?
-What are you doing?
You do not have to get tired.
Go to the bed.
What has happened?
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
Bright lady.
and experiences.
"My name is Fran, I'm 44 years old."
But I have 30 years experience behind me.
Right.
The chefs enjoy the limelight now.
"Hello, I'm Scott."
"I'm from Manhattan, New York."
I'm here to win Hell's Kitchen.
"But in Hell's Kitchen, you have to prove yourself."
Bold statement.
Good.
And this time is no exception.
Okay.
Because Chef Ramsay has an important announcement.
I want to officially guarantee that we will complete the opening night dinner service at Hell's Kitchen.
"Oh, man."
Has he lost his damn mind?
Why would he promise that?
"I'm, like, thinking to myself, like,"
I don't know how we're going to do that.
It's never been done before.
Is that clear?
"Yes, Chef."
I can't hear you;
is that clear?
"Yes, Chef!"
"And with that, Hell's Kitchen begins."
Get in there and cook me a signature dish.
Off you go!
Let's not let Gordon down.
Where're they!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Go!
Wait
Where're they?
I let them go
You idiot!
What are you talking about?
You're wrong!
I'm a martial arts practitioner!
Get him!
"Master, the foreigners at the leprosarium have withdrawn suddenly"
Hurry!
Ask our men at the leprosarium to withdraw too
I want to save and set them free as well!
Someone set us free!
We want revenge!

Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death...

We want to get even with you
We won't back off!
We won't back off!
Quiet please!

We have 500 men here
"If we all fight, it will be a bloodshed"
Filip!
He's not here either.
I found him!
"Here, quickly!"
Come on!
Help!
Let's bring him outside!
I couldn't extinguish it.
I think I might have given too big a dose.
Let me go!
Departure is in one hour.
Greetings to you all.
"- What is it, please?"
- A contemporary custom.
There.
I have a surprise for you.
A cake!
Right!
With Nasper-cream!
And that's not all!
The best is yet to come.
Watch and wonder!
"This is Adam Bernau's violin, about which he wrote in the Memoirs, that it was his companion throughout his entire childhood."
It's so moving to think that I'll have the chance to see the living Adam Bernau in less than 2 hours.
And on his 11th birthday.
I hope we'll only be there for 4 hours.
It seems unreal.
"When my parents boarded the spaceship, that seemed so unbelieveable too."
So many beautiful women!
"While I, idiotically..."
Prepare for start!
Shields off!
But I beat them black and blue.
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh.
I can make arose stink.
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give lice to a bald head.
Listen.
You can't even lie properly.
- Shiv the truth is...
- Kamini!
He's no brave officer.
Kamini!
- He's a coward cop.
- Kamini.
- What?
- Kamini.
Kamini.
Calm down.
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.
You're not worthy of being my husband.
I say you're not worthy of this uniform either.
Inspector!
What did she hurl at me witch.
Nephew.
It's like this.
I'm actually a sub-inspector.
I couldn't become an inspector.
You see.
I had been appointed for the security... of that crazy ACP Ayushman Thakur's sister.
Now how do I go with this broken hand?
You don't get it.
See.
What are you doing?
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
"Before they killed them, they tortured them."
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
"I didn't know, I didn't know..."
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
"W-Well, you see..."
Would you like some food?
It's my mum's birthday today.
She's even got lots of food stalls.
Really?
.
"Hold on, you two."
We can't go about accepting handouts.
"I'm King Pilaf, you know?"
Aw...
Oh well.
"If you say so, Pilaf-sama..."
Is that so?
Okay then.
Y-You fools.
You're too obedient.
How about going against my orders sometimes and bringing me back a bit?
.
It's all tasty.
"Well, if you insist, I guess I'll have to eat it."
Delicious.
You two dig in as well.
Pilaf-sama.
Even 150-fold gravity has outlived its purpose...
"Excuse me, Vegeta-sama?"
Leave.
You're interrupting my training.
"B-Bulma-sama called, she wants you to come to her birthday party."
Just go away already.
Tell her I'm not going to any such thing.
Vegeta.
"What's going on in that head of yours, not coming to your pretty wife's birthday party?"
Find her!

It looks like you ran afoul of somethingNwith wicked claws.
And I'm still dreaming.
What did that to you?
-Banner or Bander...
N-The Bandersnatch?
I'd better have a look.
What are you doing? or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't.Nl'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
At least let me bind it for you.
-What do you call yourself?
N-Alice.
The Alice?
-There's been some debate about that.N-l never get involved in politics.
You'd best be on your way.
What way?

Fine.

Ah.
"Yeah, I-I wouldn't know."
She and I are
Keeping our creative lives separate right now.
"Uh, you might wanna discuss this one,"
Since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
"You know what, dad?"
I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um...
"I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring,"
"But I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like,"
Perhaps you'd like to invite her.
"Actually, I'm gay."
"So if I was going, which I'm not,"
Then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh...
Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him-
Please stop acting like
You and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um...
I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that
"Closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um..."
My suicide attempt.
Why'd you have to leave me?
I can't explain that.
"(LINE RINGING, PHONE RINGING)"
"Hi, honey."
How was breakfast?
Did you tell Dad not to contact me?
(SIGHS)
It's not that simple.
"When he called out of the blue,"
I said that now might not be the best time.
You could have told me that last night.
- I'm tired of all these secrets.

- (SIGHS) - (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)
"So, who were you on the phone with basically at dawn?"
"- Hey, fun story."
None of your business.
- Always so mysterious.
"Look, maybe we should go get breakfast instead of breaking and entering?"
- I'll spring for pancakes.
- No pancakes.
"Ooh, wait!"
"Hey, frame me up."
"Maybe use, like, a Dutch angle so it's creepier."
I got it.
This is it.
"Oh, what?"
The unit was already unlocked?
Crescent Palms guy was hazing you.
We'll see.
- You recording?
- ‭Yup.
I've only seen him a few times...
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?
Maybe.
I began to believe that two of victims were part of a Satanic cult.
What?
We found another body few days ago...
Same M.O. The victim was completely drained of blood...
But there were bite marks on the victim's neck.
Small ones.

You... have to invite me in.
It's your home
What if I don't...?
Why can't you just come in...?
Is there something in your way...?
No!
"Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?"
Does this make us friends?
Something up here after all.

-You.

What about the others?
Can I help them?
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose I don 't know what to do.

I made him confess to the police.
That's all?
"Yeah, that's all."
"In fact, I wasn't even with him when he killed himself."

Only the police know about this.

You're a police officer?
Even I hate surprises.
Okay.

"No, you listen to me, sweetheart, okay?"
"I am coming to Fort Lauderdale, and when I get there,"
"I am gonna find you and I am going to [Bleep] you so [Bleep] hard, you..."

I knew you were a bad guy.
This is where I come to be bad.
I'm a good guy. [Chuckles]
Ah.
"Good guy, bad guy, it's all perception."
Me?
I say I'm just a woman.
You say I'm exceptional woman.
- I never said that.
"- Yes, you do."
I see how you look.
"No, I look."
I don't say that.
"Yeah, but, you know, in my village,"
I'm just average woman.
Like fourth most attractive sister in family.
Bullshit.
Don't buy that story for a second.
Okay?
Yeah.
"You are, objectively, the most attractive woman in every village."

Dodge.
Sorry.
"Uh, substitute coach Roth."
Yes?
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous.
Take a lap!
But...
Go nuts.
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Run a failed restaurant?
- She probably can't even cook.
- Her vagina insult cut me to the quick... but her crumb cake was like a cloud from heaven.
Yeah.
But it is cake.
"I mean, who needs cake?"
Not exactly the pillar of a meal.
Are you implying that your fish is more important than my cake?
I'm not implying it.
I'm stating as fact.
Really?
Ever heard of a birthday fish?
No.
Dad ever take you on a caking trip?
"Oh, no, he didn't."

"DeBray could have a partner, and the partner could have shot him to stop him from talking."
"Hey, Cupcake!"
Tell the lady what you just told me.
We tracked the bike.
Registered to a David Loquasto.
He was in here earlier today to I.D. the jewelry.
His sister was the fifth victim.
I've never seen either of these.
"We couldn't stop the man who killed his sister, so he took care of it."
See?
"You still holding me, Captain?"
Case closed.
What'd I tell you?
Not a partner.
Revenge.
My baby's gonna live.
Yeah.
Long enough to turn into a teenager and make you wish otherwise.
Don't forget about Mimi.
She didn't die.
No.
You leave Lucy out ofit.
Done.
Lucyhas no more to fearfrom me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or--"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
Soyou call me when you want it to stop.
- [Beeps ]
"- She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"[Doug] Ifshe knows all this aboutyou, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I-
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.
There's a reason why the feds wantyou to testify.
I saywe hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, ifwe go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
"What about ifshe comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's sonJasper?
$12.000 is a pretty good price.
But I cannot be bought.
"I might be influenced, but never bought."
"Mr. O'Hara, please."
"Mr. O'Hara, this is Mrs. Ryan."
What is the latest quote on the Wentworth Drug?
I see.
Would you please transfer four thousand shares from Mr. Sabourin's account to mine?
He's right here.
He'll confirm it.
"O'Hara, it's alright to transfer the stock to Mrs. Ryan's account."
I'll be in the office later and consign all the papers then.
"Alright, goodbye."
Here.
Thank you.
Now we have a deal.
Right.
The stock is now up to ten.
What?
Now I've made roughly $20.000 since your offer.
"I outsmarted you, Mr. Sabourin."
"Well, I always admire anyone who can outsmart me."
Goodbye.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Dodds."
"Oh, Mr. Sabourin."
I have that transfer ready for you to sign.
Alright.
What's the latest quote on Wentworth Drug?
Fifteen.
As of now you have made a profit of $200.000.
That's not a bad day's work.
Where did you get that tip?
How many Tiles belong?
112.
"You got it, sweetheart."
- Just tell me when.
- Fantastic!
You'll come for dinner before?
- I'll make a brisket.
- I love brisket.
Get home safe.
"Well, I'm taking a cab anyway."
Thanks again.
"Hello, Larry."
"- I got to see you, Frank."
"- Well, here I am."
How about a cup of coffee?
"No, thanks."
We got to talk.
Are you finished here?
"Well, the business of government is never finished."
"Come on, let's take a walk."
Mister A!
"How are you, Milton?"
I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl With no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy
"Speaking of blueberry pies bring us a couple, Milton."
"You, à la mode?"
"No, thank you."
I don't want any pie.
Apple for him.
"And coffee, Milt."
- So I'll call you?
- All right.
- Is Stanislav at his work?
- Yes.
Too bad you didn't bring Irishka.
I've missed her so much!
Your glasses gave me a fright.
Thought something's wrong with your eyes.
"No, I'm all right."
"To hell with them, take them off!"
"Here, Shurka sent you a note."
She had a baby at last!
A swell boy!
Could hardly deliver him.
It's about dress patterns.
And she wants a necklace for the New Year.
"- Here, have an apple."
"- I don't want it, mama."
"- What about you, young man?"
- Merci.
What's the matter with you?
"Oh, what are you doing, mama?"
Why did you have to smear it all?
I smeared it all!
Goodbye!
"The general, we rode together."
Handsome man!
Came to inspect exercises.
And in my compartment was the chief engineer of a fishing factory!
About my age.
"I nicknamed him ""a man with a mustache""."
He got a mustache like a cube!
"Well, you can't."
You can't just ask her like that.
- Why not?
"- It would be terribly rude, asking someone if money is theirs."
That would be so embarrassing!
"Rubbish, Basil."
"Hello, Fawlty Towers."
Polly Sherman?
"Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway."
Hang on.
Polly!
"Terry, where's Polly?"
In there.
- She saw you with the money!
- What?
She saw you counting the horse money!
She's just coming...
"oh, hello, dear."
Here she is.
Found her in here.
"As I was just saying, Polly, my wife would like a word with you about a slightly delicate matter."
"It's not delicate, Basil."
Don't be silly.
He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that money I saw you with earlier on in the office.
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs. Richards has lost some.
The money?
In the office?
"You were counting it, weren't you?"
Did someone hand it in?
"Oh, no."
"No, it's mine."
Good for the pain within.
Very good super aspirin.
My body feels light.
Soon you'll feel much better.
I think the Paki fancies the pusher frau.
Hossein is no Paki.
He's Persian.
"Well, then the Persian fancies the pusher frau."
"- Hi, Steso."
"- Maria, get dressed."
- It smells of... opium!
- Against pain.
Too expensive for you.
- Fucking Paki!
- Persian.
"Fucking Persian, then."
Asger?
How's my credit?
- Very bad...
- Right.
I'll just hang around then.
"We're all waiting for something bigger and better to hit us, right?"
I'm not waiting for anything.
"Will you let Asger tattoo your hardened, Middle Eastern body?"
Having tattoos is a sin.
Your body is a temple.
It's sacred.
"You don't tag your own temple, do you?"
"- And you, Steso."
You got any?
- Plenty.
Look!
It's Dave and Sharon's engagement party.
That's what I'm saying.
"Obviously, we don't report it tonight."
There is a dead fucking st-rotting corpse in the storage unit.
You can't smell anything as long as we keep the door closed.
Wow.
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?
Uh-uh.
Look.
"We let the party happen, we look at tomorrow's photo... and if it shows the cops taking our testimony and shit, I'll call 'em myself."
I have to admit.
I am kind of curious to see one more photo.
All right.
Fine.
One day.
But... one day.
(MUSIC)
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.
"Well, just in case tomorrow's photo shows the end of the world-"
(INHALES) I'm going to enjoy myself.

You're supposed to be on lookout?
What's goin' on?
We're trying to find a way out.
"But everything's locked from the outside, and these locks,"
I just never seen anything like them.
"The walls are concrete, and I was telling the guys"
I think the windows are palladium-
- Palladium plated.
"Actually, that means you can't break the windows."
We're just double checking.
"I know what it means, Connor."
"Don't fucking start with me, man."
All right?
I've got this under control.
What about calling out?
Nothing works.
"Cell phones, walkie, everything's, there's no signal."
"This is really fuckin' bad, man."
"Ah, Goddamn, I think I broke my ass."
You got a gun?
Yeah.
- Well let's use it.
- What?
Get out of the way.
"- No, no no."
- Get out of the way.
"Ah fuck, Riley."
"Shit, what are you..."
"Ah, stop."
- Shit.
Just stop.
Look.
No smoking.
No smoking.
We need fitness if we're gonna get this job done.
We need fitness if we're gonna get this job done.

"Give us a hint, Ray."
"A bank, payroll, armoured car, what?"

"Hey, fellas."

"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Wheelman, second gun, whatever - I'll do anything, mate."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about."
We're just getting ourselves fit.
We're just getting ourselves fit.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."
Yeah?
"I'm already fit, mate."
"Laurie, mom!"
I want to show you guys something.
I had an idea.
"Actually, something mom said gave me an idea."
So I took the van to...
"Here, just come with me."

"So, you're out of wine, but you don't want to go to the store, so you call Gulfhaven's only mobile wine bar."

Or the worst.
Laurie?
I think it's great.
"No, really, Travis."
"I-I-- actually, I think it's brilliant."
"[ Chuckles ] Oh, hey."
"Here, take a flier."

- Very real.

What about fruit and vegetables?
"Yes, gladioli!"
"Tell me this, are you trying to be funny, saying there are no vines?"
Is that what you call homework?

"No, Tommy."
- You smell gorgeous.
- I said no.
You know you love it.
A bit of the old Tommy magic.
"It doesn't work anymore, Tom."
Shit.
"Ooh, shit!"
Wait...
Why me?
- 'Cause you're different.

But...
"You know, he was capable of that kind of thing too."
- At 3:00 a.m.?
"- Yeah, at 3:00 a.m."
He didn't know what time it was.
- Did you ever drink with Lou?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Oh, you should ask my first wife."
"Hello, Mr. Katz?"
This is Nathaniel Kahn returning your call.
"Yes, I would like very much to hear what you saw that night in Penn Station, New York."
What an incredible coincidence.
"Please give me a call back and let me know where I can meet you, or I'll try you again later."
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Are you David?
"No, I'm not David, no, sorry."
I'm supposed to meet somebody right here.
... Me too a guy named Richard Katz.
What are you doing?
"Actually, this guy Richard Katz was... my dad died 26 years ago, and he was with my father in Penn Station, New York."
- Is that right?
"- Yeah, and"
I don't know the story of what happened.
So Richard Katz is coming to tell me.
- Is that great?
- I don't know if it's great.
"- It's something, anyway."
- That's... yeah.
"- Yeah, I hope he shows up."
You two disgust me.
Fuck me!
"Well, every cloud has a silver lining, even the cloud that is black and smokey, because it's an explosion with a dead male in the middle of it."

I know a place that's open all night long.
O'Leary's Bar.
Hey.
Teddy and Mick run it.
Come on.
"They're not related to me, are they?"
"Well, they won't admit it now!"
"Hey, look at this guy, remember him?"
Yeah.
Philip.

"Ha-ha ha-ha, see you, Phil."
"Hey, Phil."

We'll have to walk.

Clara is right.
Mum's used to speak badly of you.
But I always defend you.
Don't do it.
It's useless.
-But it upsets me.
"If I'd say bad things about mom, would you defend her as well?"
I've never heard you dissing her.
Well I can do it.
Mom is so selfish.
She just wants everybody saying good things to her.
Everybody like that.
"Yeah, but maybe there's someone thinking different."
Clara demands everything and she's right.
Mom says you're a looser.
To whom?
I heard.
She said that so you'd listen to it.
-No.
But I'm sure she knew I was listening.
With whom were she talking to?
Could you guess?
I met a woman once...
-Aren't you interested in what mom said anymore?
"Once, I met a woman who told me to write down 7 numbers."
-And she told you each number slowly without failing.
And all the numbers were odds.
"Well then, with whom were she talking to?"
To Juan.
Juan?
Clara is dating Juan?
You're never aware of anything.

That's not mine.
- It is.
"Fixed the brakes, replaced the chain, cleaned and oiled the gears."
Added a nice new basket.
"Repaired your saddle, changed both tyres, refitted new inner tubes and... cleaned and polished your frame."
That must have set you back.
"The bill for parts and labour stands at you calling me ""Spencer""."
Oh.
Very well.
Thank you so much...

"Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor."
[Seahorse] Sebastian!
"[Pants] Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you."
I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you rightaway.
Something about Ariel.
[Gasps] He knows.
"[Laughs] Hey, let's see now."
"Oh, who could the lucky merman be?"
"[Clears throat] Come in, Sebastian."
[Inhales sharply] I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
[Squeaky voice] Yes?
[clears throat]
"- Yes, Your Majesty?"
- Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?

"You weren't thinking of leaving, were you, Diane?"
Not with two years left on your contract.
"You can't hold her, Jessie."
"Think not, kiddo."
"Of course, if you want to buy her contract, it's worth at least 20 grand."
"But I like you, Bobby."
I'll let you have her for 1 5.
You haven't got 1 5?
That's too bad. [ Chuckles ]
"Well, I suppose I'm just gonna have to keep her."
"Well, of course you can visit Diane... for a more reasonable fee anytime she isn't occupied."

"You did good, all right?"
"All right, stop crying and go to sleep."
- Jacob...
What if we really went to Galveston like Mom wanted?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Would you like to try our new Quiet Burger?
"- No, thanks, Ted."
I'll just have an order of Crazy Fries.
"- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?"
- Ham.
- Watch out.
There's enough rat poison in this dipped cone to kill a neo...

You are still eating mom's food.
I know where this conversation will end.
Don't be boring.
Okay?
Welcome.
"Did the elderly man ask for food, today as well?"
No.
"But, how did you know that it was me?"
"Your deodorant brand is Nivea, right?"
You are awesome.
"I forgot to pay the bill, yesterday."
How much was it?
- It's Okay.
If I get the money
The credit for the good deeds will go to you.
No need.
Sorry.
- He is no criminal!
"- So, he's starting to act like that again?"
"Not him, me!"
You darling?
Ah well.
Kiss me!
Kiss!
What a fine girl you are.
Just how I like it.
He's hanging around with scum like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself!"
- Let me go!
I can't breathe!
"- Feel free, there is plenty of air!"
You think you can just run away and ashame me in front of my friends later tonight?
"Reinhold said Kiss me, follow my order!"
Let me go!
I'll take anything I can find and throw it in your face!

"Hi, Special Agent Henson, FBI."
Thank you for coming.
We're grateful for the warning.
"Well, you should know that our people will be at the rally regardless, looking for the individual planning the attempt."
"Once word gets out Mr. Dellaman won't be attending the rally,"
I'm sure she'll be long gone.
"I hope that won't be the case, but unfortunately, you may be right."

What's wrong?
Hey.
Are you okay?
What?
The girl was only after the papers.
Sondra?
The papers are gone.
She took the papers?
I tried calling her.
The line's disconnected.
I even went to the coffee shop.
Turns out she doesn't even work there.
She totally faked me out.
I don't believe this.
"How could you let this happen, Jerry?"
No.
The question remains the same.
Who would want to kill Mr. Malhotra?

I guess it was naive of me to believe you.
Anyway...
I just want you to know that...

"Hey, did you see psycho there?"
"Oh, yeah."

"You know, if you're ever interested."

"Oh, I am."

Nobody.
He is all alone.
"Earlier his daughter would write to him, every week."
- That doesn't happen anymore.
- Why not?
"She died, poor thing."
"It was a car accident, January 2006."
Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone.
"Poor man, all broken down."
I understand.
What was his daughter's name?
Natasha.
Natasha Malhotra.
Can I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports?
Why not.
But it could take some time.
"I'll have to go through some of the old files, you see."
Sure.
I will have someone call you later.
Is that okay?
- No problem.
- Thank you.
"We're done, let's go."
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
One thing is certain.
The murder wasn't committed by Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
Right.
But he was the reason for it.

"You put those cuff links in my bag, didn't you?"
Admit it.
-Say the word and I'll set you free.
-Never.
When as in silks my Maudie goes
-Don't try to sweet-talk me.
-Then methinks how sweetly flows
You tell these people I didn't take your cuff links and get me out of here.
-Then when I cast my eyes and see
"-Quit it, I hate that poem."
-That brave vibration each way free
"-Ezra, make him leave."
"Oh, no, this is beautiful."
"God, I can't bear it."
"Maudie, I've substituted your lovely name for Julia's."

-About this sniper.
-Have you swallowed some gas as well?
"- This was a gas canister, after all."
-Where is it?
- Overthere. lt has a hole in it.
I long for a drink right now!
Did the canister remain in place afterthe shot?
I'm not so stupid as to carry it here afterthe shot. I was underthe fire.
I ask you again.
Did it remain in place?
"Yes, itjustjumped up a little bit."
-Where is that place?
- On the road to the farm of Marek.
-Do you want me to showthe place to you?
"- No, I'll find it myself."
"-Listen, and why did you take me?"
- l did what?
-Why did you take me as a mate?
- l like your looks.
Do you?

I used to meet a boy.
His name was Volodya.
He was a pilot.
I must have loved him.
He perished in his plane.
Just a day after he was kissing my hands.
"Then another boy Andrei, used to court me."
He was a scout and died too.
Then Vanya.
I began feeling fear.
It is dangerous to love me.
Do you understand that?
-You'd rather come back.
"- l'll be back, Olya."
"And we'll kill your sniper, that's for sure."
Take myword on that.
"I, Kolya Malakhov, give you this word."

Why?
So I can be examined by Doctor Imm.

I'm following her treatment plan.
She wrote down all your history.
So your treatment plan is the same.
C'mon.
I studied the same specialty as Doctor Imm.
I won't kill you.
Let me see your arm.

It's really attractive to me.
"Robin, are you alright?"
I'm perfectly alright...!
- ls that really you?
- Of course it's me!

"No sleep at night, no waking up in the morning."
Couldn't eat at meals.

Thank you.
I need a phone.
I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
What do you mean the other one?
Hendricks.
He came in last night.
He'd been in a car accident.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
I have to go.
(SINGING)
You've got three children.
Ah.
"Oh, if this phone could only talk."
"Well, it can if you want it to."
Everything you want to know about will is right in there.
"His friends, his music, everything."
"No, no, I-I can't invade his privacy that way."
I can.
"No, put that down."
Someone's texting him.
It's from Stephanie.
"""Did you tell your mom yet?"
"Did she freak?""..."
Freak?
About what?
What does he need to tell me?
"Well, find out yourself."
Pretend you're will and text her back.
I shouldn't do that.
"But as a mother,"
"I need to know what's going on with my son... by any means possible, right?"
- Indeed you do.
- Absolutely.
Okay.
"""How should I tell her?""..."
"Oh, I shouldn't have done that."
I just totally violated his privacy.
I am done with this.
"Ooh, she texted back."
"""Why are you texting like an old lady?""..."
"Ah, you shouldn't have spelled everything correctly."
Oh.
You want to take another at bat?
"No, it's okay."
(Cell phone ringing)
"Ma, I'm gonna run, okay?"
"Okay, mi Amor."
Where's he going?
I don't know...
with his friends?
(Woman) You can keep it up.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Why you let him play with that shit for?
"Let him be, Enriquito."
"He's a little man, why don't you put a ball in his hand?"
Get him out there with the other kids?
"Do me a favor, E.,"
Don't worry about raising my kids.
They have me for that.
Worry about your own kid.
"What's that supposed to mean, huh?"
"I'm just saying, be a father to your own kid, that's all."
"Cayense, cayense la Boca."
Be nice.
"Igualito a papi, no?"
Callate la Boca!
What you talking about papi for?
That nigga was never there.
"Yeah, E., and how are you any better?"
"Stop it, puñeta!"

"What the fuck, Karina?"
"I told you not to curse in front of the fucking kids,"
You fucking fuck.

Baby.
Daddy!
- You look wonderful!
- Thank you.
How's mom?
Not good.
"See, a lot has been going on since you've been away"
And none of it's making your mother a happier person.
"What, dad?"
"Really, is she okay?"
"Yeah, she's okay,"
But nothing around her is.
She's been out of work for six months now
- And even worse...
- Wait.
"What, daddy?"
I wasn't even gone for that long.
How much could happen in six months?
A lot.
You mother never really had savings.
She's been living at her means.
And she lost her car and all of the furniture.
The house is completely empty.
"- What, daddy?"
- Yeah.
Tell Daeso I'd like to see him in private.
"I will, Governor."
Trade with the Han will stop again if the King refuses Yangjung's demand.
"Daeso, you went to all that trouble in Hyunto."
I just hope it wasn't all in vain.
Father will make a wise decision.
Try not to worry too much.
No.
He'll never do anything to help the Han.
Things have changed since then.
Refusing Yangjung's demand will affect the salt situation... and Father knows we'll have to go to war over it.
This is stupid.
Why are we putting up with this?
That Yangjung keeps on bothering us.
Daeso.
Why don't I just kill him?
I know.
I'm just saying.
You wanna be president?
Just say it.
Say it.
I'll step aside right now.
Can I do my job?
Please.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- Hello?
"- Hey, it's Noah."
- Remember me?
The guy you used to work with?
- Yeah.
I just heard about your father.
"My, my. [Clears throat]"
- [Laughter]
"- Reverend Robin, the floor is..."
All yours. [Chuckles]
Holy shit.
I don't think I can marry you.
"Well, I don't wanna marry you."
I-I wanna marry her.
- [Men laugh]
- Man:
"Hey, good one, Rob."
I-I can't do this 'cause she's 16.

Do you wanna say something?
[Lowered voice] I'm so sorry I sprayed you.
"Whoa, now... now..."
now I'm an intuitive man.
I'm starting to get the idea that you two don't approve of this union.
"Now whatever happened to, and I quote,"
"""What is wrong with these backwards, pigheaded philistines?"""
"Oh, no, that's when I thought she was Jewish."
Oksana:
She is Jewish.
What got to do with it?
You are anti-semite?
No!
"I... hold... well, hold on."
Is this even legal?
Can I steal you for a sec?
"I, uh... inadvertently lip-kissed your mom."
Greg.
I didn't enjoy it!
Why do you even have to say that?
There's no way everyone's staying quiet about Grandma.
You don't think so?
Care to make it more interesting?
I'll bet on it.
It's on!
When have I ever high-fived?
"You know, when I was a stewardess, before every flight, I had to get on the scale."
"And if you weighed over 118, they put you on diet pills and only let you fly out of Jersey and Detroit."
That's terrible.
"No, no, no."
It kept me looking fantastic.
Mom!
That's degrading.
"Mama, where's my stress ball?"
Oh.
"Honey, we'll find it."
And I feel ya.
"What, so now she's using a stress ball?"
When the need arises.
"Knock, knock!"
Happy Thanksgiving!
- Viv?
- So fun!
Greg saw me through the window and waved me in!
"Hi, everybody!"
Look at your table!
Yeah.
Oh!
Wow.
Are...
Are these... from the street?
You know what?
You're lucky I'm here.
I'm gonna let you use my fall tablescape.
"There's nothing wrong with my table, Viv."
You are so funny!
Greg!
Hi.
I'm Viv.
It's so nice to meet you.
You're too bony for me.
"I didn't think that you could do anything worse than making out with my mom, but congratulations."
You topped it!
"Well, she was desperately peering through the window."
What was I supposed to do?
The same thing that you do if someone asks if you have a minute to save the environment...
You look at your shoes and you keep moving.
"Darling, you are stunning."
"Oh, those stems!"
Tell me...
Were you ever a stewardess?
"Why, no, but thank you."
I'm Viv!
"I'm Kathryn, Katie's mother."
"Kathryn, forgive me."
"I'm sure you've been talking about this all day, but I have to ask..."
What happened to you?
No-o-o-o-o!
"Pay up, girl!"
"You know it's not cursing if you say a letter, mom."
"Oh, sure."
Sure.
"""F."" ""F!""..."
"You know, honey."
We never got a chance to talk about the divorce.
"And we can do that, if you'd like."
"No, I get it."
Stuff happens.
I'm good.
Okay.
Did you know...
That Cleveland was originally spelled... c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?
The Cleveland spelling?
You went to that?
I was desperate.
"And how does that make you feel, Melanie?"
What?
"It's an annoying question, isn't it?"
But all the therapists ask it.
I've been trying different ones every day.
It's a little bit like dating... except you're not trying to hide how crazy you are.
Hello.
All.
"Victoria, are you okay?"
You look exhausted.
"Oh, good."
I was just making sure... 'cause the foundation people will be here soon.
"Oh, that's will's phone."
Why is it he can talk to everybody else but not to me?
You mustn't blame yourself.
Now I-I did absolutely everything I could... for both my kids.
You're hurting me!
Just breathe.
Tammy...
"Tammy, listen to me."
Tell me what's going on.
I don't know!
I don't know!
Paging Dr. Noah barnes.
Dr. Noah Barnes.
"Addison, can I talk to you for a second?"
Of course.
"I saw, um, Tammy in a ra... in a rage last night, and her heart rate jumped and her blood pressure spiked."
Uh-huh.
So I'm thinking...
"So you're thinking that it's more, um, physiological rather than psychological?"
"Yeah, but I went through everything."
"Uh, I was here all night, went through everything."
"Head C.T., tox screen..."
"Yeah, they're both negative, and the psych eval isn't conclusive."
Did you notice if her pupils were dilated when she got angry?
"Yeah, yeah."
It was like...
"like she was on something or like there was some kind of exaggerated fear response, but again, the C.T. scan..."
"Hey, you okay?"
Me?
"Yeah, you seem sad."
"Or you've seemed sad lately, and I c... it's none of my business, but..."
I'm not.
I don't...
I am sad.
Okay.
But I can't talk about it.
Let's go.
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"The ocean-going Blue Sea Turtle, ...is one of nature's mysteries."
It wanders far across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans...
"Excuse me, but I'm closing up now."
It's the end of the road for him.

Very hurt.
There's a part I still need.
Five a.m. Welcome to the day.
What the hell are you doing?
Why's it open?
Say something!
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
"Spill the beans, we know you did it!"
See you next week.
Let's go to our reporter live at the scene...
"He's got no immunity, ...to our bacteria."
What's she talking about?
"Quiet, the old guy'll be furious."
Don't worry.

Looks good.

There's only one Windward park or school.
"Oh,man,Windward elementary.That's close to my shop.I know those kids."
"Hey,Tanner."
You bored of me yet?
We've got a park to check out.
The park's clear!
Swept both playgrounds and the field.Park's clear.
Looks like your intel was off.
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes,mom.We're all over it."
- Watch your step out there.
"- Yeah,you too,Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?

Tell me that you're still at the park.

Tell me what?

He needs to know.
"Kaman, while you were in a coma,"
I found out I was pregnant.
Oh...
I didn't know what to do.
I thought you were gonna die.
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry."
You're telling me... that's my son?
"[Hotch] Kaman, you don't want to do this in front of your son."
Put it down.
"Baby, if you don't do it for me, do it for him."
Don't you want to know his name?
What's your name?

I don't know.

"Well, I guess I didn't want our relationship to start on a lie."
Our relationship?

Okay.

I don't want to hear about it 'cause it isn't true.
That isn't Artie.
"I don't want to believe it either, Pete,"
But it's true.
"Yeah, well, you shouldn't even be reading that."
Pete.
We should be out doing something.
"Pete, his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen."
It's Artie Weisfelt.
He used to work for the NSA.
He was a cryptographer--a code breaker--
When he was in his 20s.
They recruited him right out of school.
They had him decoding soviet communications.
"He intercepted letters, phone transcripts."
Then they think he turned.
He contacted one of the people they were spying on
And he started selling secrets to the Russians.
"And his file, it just ends."
He was never prosecuted.
It's like he just disappeared.
"But it's him, Pete."
What?
It's definitely him.
You're under arrest.
"No, no, no. listen to me."
I have to take this.
Julie-Ann's bra.
She was moved in the van.
I thought dragging her all that way on crutches was unlikely.
We need to find the hole he's hiding in and visit the known associates in the area.
Right.
We're gonna start with addresses nearest the Pembridge and then fan out.
"Hudson, Edwards."
Your list.
"Harris, your list."
"Tennison, with me."
- Hello.
"Have you seen this man, David Bentley?"
- No.
Never seen him.
- Positive?
- Quite sure.
Sorry to... bother you.
My name's DC Edwards.
I'm from Hackney Police.
Do you recognise this man at all?
"Er... no, sorry."
No.
We'd have a better chance getting Clifford's mates to tap-dance than co-operate.

You can drive.
I nearly bust a stitch going down those stairs.

"Well, thank you, sir."
It's a bloody wild-goose chase.
Where next?
Next one's on Fairview Avenue.
"Oh, you're Watt."
I'm the manager!
- What?
- I'm the manager!
"Yes, I know."
You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?
"Now, listen to me."
I booked a room with a bath.
"When I book a room with a bath, I expect to get a bath."
You've got a bath.
"I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T., for a room without a bath!"
Here is your bath.
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.
It's disgraceful!
I wish you were a mouse.
I'd show you.
And another thing.
I asked for a room with a view.
"Deaf, mad, and blind."
"This is the view as far as I can remember, madam."
"Yes, yes, this is it."
"When I pay for a view,"
I expect something more interesting than that.
"That is Torquay, madam."
That is not good enough.
"Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?"
"Sydney Opera House, perhaps?"
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...
Don't be silly.
Let me give you your coat.
That's all right.
It's OK.
Thanks a lot.
Ralphie.
"Hello, boy."
How you been?
What a good boy.
Can I buy you breakfast?
I know this great little diner.
Sure.

"Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty"
He told her goodbye...
But he had no reason why...
That's all I got so far.
"Well, I was soaked to the marrow"
I was chilled to the heart
I took shelter in her room
She called me from the corner
Of a song I never liked
For the occasion that was in there
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?

"The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both."
"Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale, but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99."
"The shoes were just marked down from $155, so you're looking at $1,042.68."
I'm pretty good with numbers.

"Yeah, so let me know when I can ring that up for you guys."
- Yes.
Thank you.

Hey.
Hey.
- Could you help me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm looking for a tie.
"Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale on the ties."
"And if you want, I could probably get you an additional 10% with my employee discount."
- This one's nice.
- Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
"This one has actually been treated with our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection, you know, to repel liquids and stains."
"- Well, that's really functional."
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's pretty functional."
Face me.
Stay still.
"Despite being tempted by the Nano-Tex repellant,"
"I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben."
I came to see you.
You did?
- Where's Ted Carter?
Right here.
Let's stop that corny music and do some serious dancing.
- Those are good records.
- These are new ones.
- I brought some mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?
"- Hang it high, will you?"
- Only if I can kiss Betty.
"Tonight, nobody is safe from me."
"- Hey, Christmas is eight months away."
- I do my Christmas kissing early.
- Hey!
- Where's the punch?
- It's over there.
"- Oh, good."
- Add the old family formula.
"- Now you're talking, Rod."
My mother wouldn't want me to...
- Don't tell me she's here.
"- No, she's at the movies."
Put the booze in the bowl.
That's the one thing she made me promise.
You want to have a party or not?
- You can't fight city hall.
- Put the liquor in.
Forget it.
I know 10 other ways to make a party successful.
"Now, first, we gotta make the atmosphere a little more intimate."
"Rodney, aren't you the one."
- Evening.
- Good evening.
Mm.
"Well, you're on medical suspension, so if this shit's in California, it's shady as hell."

Doesn't matter.
I'm taking the fight.
"Okay, then."
See you out there.
[Knock on door]
How you feeling?
Lisa:
I'm so tired I can barely move.
What did the doctor say?
"Apparently, feeling like shit is perfectly normal."
[Door closes]
"You know, if I could carry this child for you, I would."
Really?
Yeah.
You're amazing.
How did I ever find you?
The universe fucking loves you.
[Laughs]
You see me work with your girl?
I did.
What do you think?
Honestly?
She doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.
She got some talent.
What's her story?
She's had a few fights.
She's got a shitty record.
"She's bounced around a bunch of gyms, and she had a falling out with Marco over at team elite."
- Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"- Oh, good."

"All right, the story's on the 10:00 news."
A little slow.
A bullet took the life of an innocent 6-year-old  on his way to school during a police action.
They're all over it like a cheap suit.
It's going to stick to us like one too.
Then what?
- Who is he?
- I thought he was you.
Especially when we couldn't find you.
Then one of my men told me you were at Major Lescourt's funeral.
I thought it was a sick joke.
I almost fired him.
- But who is he?
- A good question.
Come on.
We are talking to witnesses.
Apparently he was being chased.
There's evidence he had been tortured.
His death was not an easy one.
"Here's the bag, sir."
This was found in the victim's pockets.
These matches are from the Hotel Chevre d'Or.
- Our men are there now.
- Let's go.
"Alain, walt."
This is not your case.
I'm not sure I want you involved at this point.
I am involved!
Did you see his face?
Are you coming or what?
"Monsieur Suverov, thank God!"
This man told me you were killed in a car accident.
"- Good morning, sir."
- You only had your hair cut!
Yes.
Mikhail Suverov.
Now If you want access to his room... why don't you ask Monsieur Suverov?
- Hide me.
- What?
How?
Rick Castle.
"Oh, hi, Courtney."
Hey.
I'm Courtney.
Hayley.
"So, what's going on?"
You guys have a beef or something?
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.
No.
No way.
We're buds.
- Oh.
- Buds?
"Last time I saw you, you tried to run me down with a golf cart 'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie."
"But what I didn't know then, which I do now, was that your movie was gonna be quite possibly the worst movie ever made."
Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have happened to my career.
[Sighs]
So thanks.
Let's do lunch some time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
Say hi to Brandon.
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?
"Yeah, I can believe her."
It was a terrible film.
"Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive."
What the hell was his name?
"Girls, I'll meet you outside."
Get her.
Okay.
"Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they?"
There we go.
"Cute, though, huh?"
How much?
- 700.
- 700?
"Yes, well, I'll tell you what."
You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days.
"Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight."
We're going to a French restaurant...
Le Bistro.
"It's five stars, so..."
I don't know if you've been to it.
"That sounds great, but this has been declined."
Declined?
You're kidding me!
Oh!
Makes me so mad.
"Like, the credit card companies..."
the way they waste your time.
Probably protecting me.
I spent a lot of money today.
Try that one.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Did it not go through?
What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?
- I love that bed.
- Don't buy this act.
* You can't throw out your uncle from Spokane *
"* Mmm, that's what you think"
* How I've longed to meet somebody like you soon *
* If I never meet you that'll be too soon *
No!
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here
* Palsy Walsy..
Let me throw 'em out.
Did you ever play football?
* Met your darling mother your sister too *
* They're young as ever and so are you *
* Palsy Walsy
* How're they treating' you?
* Fancy my meeting you here * [crowd applauding]
You hear that?
We're a hit.
"And to see, I owe it all to you."
[applause continues]
[clapping and whistling]
[knocking on door]
Who is it?
[knocking continues]
"Hello, partner."
'Thanks.
I'll wait out here.'
Would you mind passing me out a chair?
Hello.
Will you tell the manager that one of those fresh college boys is annoying me?
I'm the manager.
Get away from that door!
It's over.
Then why are you here?
This is not my wife.
This is Trudy.
I met her a couple weeks ago.
Can we go boogie boarding now?
"And once people knew what we were going through,"
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof.
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly.
"I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel."
Just tell her how you feel.
"Well, I think if you looked at everything that..."
"No, no, no, no."
Just...
Don't explain intellectually how you feel.
"You know, just tell her how you feel."
In one word.
Sure.
Angry.
Cynthia?
Judged.
Very good.
Yes?
Progress.
Excited.
Relieved.
That is it.
Yeah.
We're awesome at feelings!
Okay.
"Nice job today, guys."
That's all for today?
"Ten, nine , eight, seven , six , five , four three , two"
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinking that, since how you're 18 and all, you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meal, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn that around."
I've invited the Boss to our party.
"""Dear Daisy,"
I'm sorry I couldn't be at your birthday party but I hope you have a wonderful day.
"Chet . """
it was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
Is that Russ calling us to wish us a happy vacation?
"Because if it's not, he has got the wrong number."
Oh ...
Ur...
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .
Vi ?
No fucking way!
Violet says no.
"Violet says "" Fuck NO !"""
I thought you said we had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you would pull something like this."
"Oh, yea , no kidding."
She said you'll do that too.
Up the money and call it an easy gig!
"That's textbook, Russ!"
Okay.
KEN:
So enjoy the crab.
"And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas."
Bethie.
Your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
I know.
And somehow even he's married.
[KEN CHUCKLES]
"Oh, honey, look."
Back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y you borrowed my New York Times found some arts camp in the Berkshires wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
You never did things like everyone else.
Why not?
Because that's you.
That's why you're my favorite daughter.
You're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
"I'm retired, I'll say what I want to."
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Come here.
Stop.
KEN:
"It's true, though."
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.
Come on.
Sorry I'm late.
"No, it's okay."
I like a little time before a blind date.
"Prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars..."
This is a dream come true for me.
- Yes.
- Blue balls.
They also cut out the cucumbers in there.
I was thinking that.
There was the biggest cucumber you've ever seen.
They cut that out?
"- I mean, you guys cut that out?"
"- Oh, yeah."
You know how you popped out of that tree and said a dozen different things?
- We have all those on the DVD.
"- Oh, there you go."
- My favorite...
- And they're terrific.
- he came to rescue me.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Cutest.
"I love when you say, ""This tree is drunk."""
I'll text you.
Okay?
Poor Gary.
"He eats shit all night, he doesn't get anywhere with Tris."
He's a sympathetic character.
But it's incredible because he hangs in.
That's Sunshine Theater.
- He's the new Nick.
- He is the new...
Exactly.
"In a few weeks, he'll be going through what Nick's going through."
That...

"Morning, Kent."
"For some reason, the Army is in our front yard, Mr. Mansley."
"Please, call me Kent."
(SIGHS)
(RUMBLING)
Okay.
(SOLDIERS BARKING ORDERS)
"- All right, where is it?"
- DEAN:
What?
You know darn well what.
The monster.
The giant thing.
The metal man.
"Ah, the metal man."
"Jeez, you were scaring me there for a second."
I thought I was under attack or something.
He's in the back.
Come on.
I'll show you.
You guys got here just in time.
"This rich cat, you know, some industrialist, wants him for the lobby of his company."
He whipped out his checkbook on the spot.
"I said, ""Hey, you got him for the rest of your life."
"""But, what, I gotta let go the moment I give birth?"
"I mean, come on."
"""Give me some time to cut the umbilical, man."""
Here he is.
(MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
"Anyway, I haven't sold him yet."
"So if you really want him and if, you know, you throw in a competitive bid... (CHUCKLES)"
Must dematerialise.
Dematerialise.
Nothing working.
Nothing.
"Will he be all right, Monitor?"
-If we can trace the error in time.
"At last, Doctor."
At last I've cut you down to size.
"Hold on, Doctor, the Monitor is going to help you."
What's he doing?
The fault is in the dimensioning routine.
"We can trace it, if there's time."
"Well, can I help?"
Perhaps you can.
This is the machine code of the section that contains the error.
I must check the external registers.
Read it to me as we go.
"It is a copy of an Earth machine, so I'm afraid we have to make do with their clumsy symbols."
The Doctor taught me to read Earth numbers.
-Where are you off to?
There's work to be done.
-We're doing it.
"""A-0."
"""0-A."
"""4-A."
"""9-2."
"""2-C."
"""A-0."
"""3-0."""
"I'm sorry, I thought we had found something."
"It's somewhere in the subroutine, somewhere."
"Monitor, I still don't see why you need all these people."
Love is good to me.
It'll always overcome and we'll speak the language of love......
- Come dance.
"- No, no."
"- Yes, come on."
- Go.
- Go dance.
- Come on.
"Come on, it's Mom's dance."
Come on!
"I dream and awake, three words"
What is the world?
Three words
And that's how I feel now
"Just like then, in ""B"" Language""..."
Right!
He knew Yizhar's songs by heart though he didn't understand a word.
"He was a cook here back in the ""Beirut"" days, before we bought the place."
"Strange 911V, but the best chef I ever met."
Then why did you fire him?
I had no choice.
You see?
We were attacked two years ago.
They broke the windows and nearly burned the place down.
- Who did?
- North Africans.
They wanted revenge because one of us broke the arms of some Arab kid who swore at him.
And Maurice was involved?
"No, no."
But people started asking questions.
They want everything to be kosher.
A lot of Jews come here.
Bullshit!
He can arrest you!
"I'm gonna tell you something, but you have to promise never to repeat it, especially to Shane."
- Tell me what?
"- Swear to me, never to Shane."
Fine.
Peter and I are technically...
We're...
What?
We're married.
I know it sounds crazy.
"It kind of is crazy, but sometimes you do crazy things when you have no choice, and I had no choice."
"It's a business arrangement, pure and simple."
I know what you're thinking.
I loved your father.
I still love him.
"This has nothing to do with Judah or marriage, really."
It's business.
You married him.
"Silas, I know how strange this all sounds."
- It's Dad's birthday!
- I know.
"But he's dead, so what difference does it make?"
Stop playing the dead-dad card!
The wrong parent died!
And you know what?
Tough shit.
Get your ass back there and watch Willy fucking Wonka!
"Go, go, go!"
- Clear.
- Clear.
There's three.
Four.
I love you.

But everything was so perfect.
Turns out fairy tales end when they do for a reason.
Like everything on the upper east side
- Hello!

I've seen that party!
Everything's under control!
Much action around here?
Even money now!
Nelson by a knockout!
How about putting up a double sawbuck for me?

"You'll take him, Stoke!"
You'll take him!
All the fight news and pictures!

Okay!
Ladies and gentlemen!
"The next and final bout of the evening, four rounds!"
"In this corner, at 194 pounds!"
!
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"- Don't buy all the hot dogs, OK?"
- I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch,"
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
"No, no, no, he's OK!"
- I need you to talk for two minutes.
- About what?
- Anything.
- All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm hereto inspect your chicken nuggets."
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'!
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live!
"Let me hear you say, ""We love you, Tracy!"""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
- Are you drunk?
"When I woke up, I was on the floor."
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game.
Jesus.
"Jesus, Jesus!"
Jesus God!
God!
"I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember."
"Doesn't matter, just do as I say."
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
"We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl."
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
"-Sorry, but we're not to let you through."
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr.
Hagen's.
He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
"I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City."
It's Michael's request for your safety.
You done?
Go home.
Did I mention my development will double your property value?
"Nice try, kiddo."
- Hey.
- Hey.
Dad told me about the home.
That woman gives me the creeps.
She's like Darth Vader with lipstick.
She is with the dark side.
Clever we must be to defeat her.
"Oh, God."
Okay.
"So as was just clearly evidenced, your relative maturity level is about half mine most days."
"But seriously, if I have to say, ""No, we're just friends,"" one more time,"
I'm gonna totally drug you and dry shave your entire body.
- Wow!
"- Okay, maybe just your arms and legs."
Did you just ask me out?
"Okay, look, my dad is going to a Flyers game on Saturday."
"So, you know, he'll be gone most of the night."
You should come over.
Okay.
But I'm bringing Band-Aids and aloe vera just in case.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Later.
- Not sure we'll be able to stop the...
- Pass the sugar.
I know women.
- You already have too many shirts.
- Serious?
We'll get Toxie coming out of--
Who's Toxie?
He's not doing stunts or anything.
"No, no."
"We just-- we got to have some stuff with Toxie, man."
We can't wait around.
"It's been like five hours since his call time,"
"And he's still not here yet, you know."
--[inaudible] close-up when they were coming out
"Oh, is he here now?"
I see the van.
"That's our van, right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"I don't see him, though."
Let him see.
"We got our Toxie, right?"
Instill the fear of God into Toxie.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I think it's time to-
- I'm
Not too happy with this.
I'm happy to use this guy.
It's 10 o'clock.
This is ridiculous.
"We shot with the stand-in, who was inconspicuously"
"Tito's height, when Dave, our really Toxie,"
Is at least a foot taller.
"And he normally carries both of us, which is the humor in it."
He carries Tito and Sweetie Honey.
"It's kind of funny, 'Cause Dave's a strong guy,"
And he can do that.
"Ah, there you are, sir."
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
"Sorry, I was making a video for my son."
"You know, in case I never see him again."
Do you not do that for your kids?
Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey... hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.
"Go to sleep, Daddy's dead"
But his ghost's always watching
What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh...
- Uh...
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
- Never heard of her.
- You will.
She's in trouble.
Impossible.
It must be a mistake.
(Sighs)
A bomb...
"Yes, a bomb would do it."
"A bomb would blow him and his records and the barge to kingdom come, yet it wouldn't hurt anyone else."
Yes.
But where do we get a bomb from?
"Well, if you only want a little one you'd have to go to Ireland."
Honestly!
"Bomb, indeed."
Get the whole mad idea out of your head.
Ireland...
That's it!
(Irish accent) Ireland!
You remember that old villain at the Dublin show.
He was still at it.
Get me a sprig of that stuff they wear in the buttonhole.
What is it?
- Shillelagh.
"- No, shamrock, you twit."
"And book me on the first plane to Dublin in the morning, right?"
(Sniffles and sneezes)
Henry?
Henry?
Please don't ask any more questions about that storm.
An orphan of the storm has just arrived.
- What?
- Your girl.
- You got it.
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?
- He saved my brother.
He's a doctor.
"- Here, let's roll on this."
We're at the scene of an incredible rescue.
It appears that a doctor has saved a little boy from drowning.
"We got it, doc."
Call Mercy.
- Mercy's not a Level 1trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.
We gotta follow station protocol.
- What's your transport time?
"- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes."
- Where's your pilot?
"- Hey, Jimmy!"
Over here!
"- Sorry, doc."
We got to move.
"- Wait, wait."
We're losing time.
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.
"- He's hypothermic, needs special care."
- Mercy is closer.
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.
So Maurice isn't Jewish?
I don't know.
"I said to him, ""What do you care?"
"""I'm not asking you to pray on Yom Kippur,"
"""just say you're Jewish even if you aren't."""
But he refused.
Next year in Jerusalem.
Bye.
Where is he now?
He lives in the Le Panier district.
"Don't ask me where, he didn't say-."
"But there's a woman he took care of, maybe his mother or sister-."
We sent food there sometimes.
I can give you the address.
- Are you sure this is the address?
- I'm positive.
Now what?
There's no mother and no grandmother!
"This is Le Panier, right?"
You want to wander around aimlessly?
- Why not?
- We don't even have an address.
So what do you suggest?
- Why don't you check the phone book?
"- We did, when you were asleep."
Then look again.
I'm going to look around.
And ask people if they're Maurice Leon?
- Knock on their doors?
"- Yeah, okay?"
Why didn't Mom tell us anything?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
(LAUGHS)
"I'm sorry, but what does that have to do with Trina?"
Exactly?
"I dunno, George."
"You're the writer, mate."
Just telling you the story.
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
(PARTY MUSIC)
Excuse me.
"Ah, no worries, Mr T."
Hey Dad!
Welcome to 'Lindsay dealing with her grief through partying'.
"Not your idea, I hope."
"Well, she said she was having a few friends over after her exams, but then this happened."
Right.
I might just go see how she's doing.
Tragic.
"You've got to shut this down and kick her out, Dad."
Probably not the best idea right now.
"Yes, she's lost her Mum, but clearly it's not causing her much distress right now."
"Eugh, of all the awkward times."
Do something.
Please?
"OK, I'll have a chat to her."
Hi George!
Hope you don't mind this little post exam blow-out.
It's so cool to see all my friends.
"It might have been a good idea to ask me first, Lyndsay."
"Yeah, I know."
But once word got out
I think people just wanted to show me some love.
We better pick out a nice fancy suit for you.
"Oh, I don't need anything fancy."
That's what you think.
We got to get rid of that square outfit.
Square outfit?
"Yeah, I guess it is a little square."
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Just a minute!
Let's go.
Let's go again.
"Mr. Hoolick, my name is Skeets Powell, and I've been sent to welcome you on behalf of the student body."
"Oh, well, thank you very much, but I'm not..."
We drew lots for you.
"I've got you from 1:00 till 3:00, and then Ann Brown has you from 3:00 to 3:30."
"Joan Francis gets you until 4:15, and then Natalie Lee has you until 5:00."
"Oh, looks like I'm booked solid."
"Yeah, well, look, I'll pick you up in 15 minutes, so don't be late."
Bye!
Bye!
I got 15 minutes yet.
Who was that?
Skeets.
Oh.
(GIRLS CHATTERING)
"Good afternoon, Willy."
"Good afternoon, Aunt Nancy."
It couldn't be.
No.
I hope our amusing little school isn't boring you too much.
A school's a school.
How clever!
A school is a school.
Ethel?
"Is that you, Ethel?"
I wondered what happened to you last night.
Can't talk.
Due in the lists in 10 minutes.
"I'm coming, Mother."
Watch where you're getting the blood!
Christ!
- How else can we choose a champion?
- We could call an election.
Election?
"Oh, no."
Nonsense.
It wouldn't be fair to the knights.
- They could draw lots.
- Draw lots?
Bless my soul.
"You might as well do it dip, dip, dip, my little ship or one potato, two potatoes."
Or even hide and seek.
"48, 49, 50!"
Coming!
"The cardinal said, ""I asked for 13 vergers."
"Why have you brought me 13 virgins?"""
"Now, we're in the garden and a thousand voices said as one man:"
"""Ave, ave, passed through this way."""
"Ave, ave, what?"
- Why do I need to say ave?
- Just sit back and let something nice happen to you for a change.
Looks like they've chosen a champion.
Can you see who it is?
It's my boss.
Christ.
"Yeah, I guess that's more fun."
You're still kind of weird though.
Whatever's on here might make that murderboard look like kiddie hour.
"Watch this. ‭Noah, we're gonna be late for school."
(LINE RINGING) Shh!
"Shh, shh, shh."
"Crescent Palms, your place to relax in Lakewood."
- This is Eddie.
How can...?
"- You think you're pretty smart, huh?"
I want to know who else you told about that storage unit.
- Who is this?
"- Oh, come on."
It's Noah Foster from The Morgue.
We talked last night.
"I told you already, I don't have anything else to say."
"(MUTTERING) Oh, that's nice."
Okay.
"Look, you're spinning out these conspiracy theories that just don't exist, man."
"Just wait for the camera to sync up, okay?"
And... we are syncing.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
We're almost a quarter synced.
What are you hiding?
We are almost there.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Oh, damn it!"
It was just streaming only.
There's nothing on here.
"Uh, careful with that."
It's a bookend.
Very sturdy.
Edgar.
Heard you got deported.
"Yeah, did Mexico stick its finger down its throat and send you back?"
That's very funny.
It's a shame
Mitch isn't around to hear how witty you two are.
"Man, I know you're still pissed."
I should've told you that--
"Told me what, Edgar?"
That you're a selfish asshole with no regard for anyone or anything but your sorry-ass self?
No.
You shouldn't have told me.
I should've already fucking known.
"Hey, man."
"We don't all feel that way, Edgar."
"As a matter of fact, I got you new headshots-- a little welcome home present."
[crowd laughing in the theater]
What do you think?
"- [laughing] Oh, man."
- Fuck you!
"Come on, man, we're just fucking with you."
Man!
Prison has changed you.
Yeah.
Baby.
Eat.
They seemed so nice.
"Yeah, get used to it."
We're gonna be fine without him.
Even you said they were pretty big.
"Yeah, I say all kinds of things."
Why do some people get so much?
Couldn't win this war without them.
Captain.
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?
"Muldoon and MacDaniel, in those choppers fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V.C. Gunfire."
You mean there are V.C. That close?
Yes.
"Mr. Beckworth, I have V.C. In my own strike force."
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.
"There they are, building a boat bridge."
MacDANIEL:
"They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars."
Petersen you worry me.
Three tours of duty and you're still acting like a civilian.
"Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine."
I believe in my comfort.
We got the tin.
What about the .50 caliber?
Don't worry.
Next drop.
How'd you do it?
A guy in Khe Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon.
Bourbon!
How'd you get 2 cases of bourbon?
From a straight leg in supply in Bien Hoa.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Why would he give you that much booze?
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.
Traded him what?
"Well, she barely spoke English, so..."
Okay.
"Well, thanks anyway."
"You got it, kid."
JURY DISMISSAL:
KYLE WADE WHITE MALE A REALLY BIG GUY
What are those?
- Prayer beads.
They're beautiful.
"- Yes, well, it's very important to put your nervous energy into something, huh?"
Do you have any more of them?
Hello?
"- Ginny, thank God."
You need to go to Uncle Peter's house.
Stay there until I tell you to come back.
Visit gross Uncle Pete?
Hard pass.
So did that cute Ryan guy ask about me?
Is he single?
For once in your life just do what I ask.
- What is the matter with you?
Don't give me a hard time.
"Just go to Uncle Peter's house and do not come back to the hotel, okay?"
Just go now.
"Okay, okay, I'm going."
"Hey, Clark."
"Hey, I know you said that we can't use an iPad, but what about an eReader?"
- That's a good question.
I don't see why not.
"- Yeah, there's no Wi-Fi."
"I mean, there's no connection to the outside world, so..."
That's a question for the judge.
"One at a time, if you please."
"Yes, you sir."
A whiskey?
"Why, of course."
Be my pleasure.
This here's our finest single malt.
Join you?
I'd be honored.
"To your health, sir."
[EZRA laughing ] I have an idea.
"About what, a bank we can rob?"
About food.
"I think we should offer something to eat, like the hotel does."
Try it.
"Muchas gracias, señorita, but I am drinking my dinner."
Have you lost your mind?
The sign outside says drinks for a penny.
What next?
Pay people to come in here?
"My God, at this rate you'll be broke in no time."
"Well, isn't that the object of your little exercise, Mother?"
Might as well help it along.
MAUDE:
"Oh, and that you have."
I have just come from the bank...
... wherel discovered that you paid your own money...
... tobuythisglorifiedshack.
"Well, who else's money was I supposed to use?"
Somebody else's.
Anybody else's.
-Right.
"-Ezra, rule number one:"
"Hello, doc."
"Hi, Connie."
"- Just coffee, please."
- Right.
"Who's that, doc?"
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.
"She has a daughter in the senior class, Allison."
Beautiful woman.
She's a widow.
"Born here, but she had ambitions, and left."
Married in New York to some ad genius.
"When he died, she came back here."
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.
Bring your coffee.
"Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi, the new school principal."
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I hear about you every day from my daughter.
You've been working kind of late?
"No, I've been to the movies."
Allison's giving a party.
What does she plan to do after graduation?
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.
It's too bad she has no brothers and sisters.
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.
Only children receive all the attention of the parents.
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.

"I have a daughter, Chivonne."
"When I was in Great Meadow I wrote letters, birthday cards, that sort of thing."
And then my letters to Chivonne started coming back unopened.
I know he's a criminal.
He was a criminal.
And now he's just cured?
He's ready to be a father to Chivonne?

I'm not going to talk to her.

Here you go.
You can relax now.
I promise no one followed you and no one's watching you.
I guess this whole undercover thing got me on edge.
"Well, I can't imagine why."
So how are things going with Detective Guzman?
"Good, I think."
He says I'm giving him some good stuff.
Did he give you an ETA on when you're gonna move on the gang?
Above my pay grade.
"Guzman says when it's time,"
I'll be the first to know.
Right?
You look great!
Really great!
You think so?
Sure!
Anything else?
The family is falling apart  right in front of my eyes.
He's only going on vacation.
Yes I know.
"But for me, vacations always took years."
Oh god!
"I'm getting cold, kids."
Here he comes.
"Well, there will always be a place for you here."
"At least, as long as I'm here."
"Hey, I've heard someone wants a ride."
"What's all this here, god damn it!"
?
Your theory was right.
Those were kids from the tattoo shop.
What?
You want to know what I think?
No!
A suspect is fleeing over there.
And you're having a relationship with the other suspect.
Is it clear what you're doing here?
"No, cancel the whole operation!"
"Conflict of interest, aiding and abetting, disciplinary action."
Are you stupid!

"Franz, man!"
- They sure can sing.
I'm weird.
I'm going crazy.
Something really does seem weird...
"What's more important, my birthday or training?"
.
"Come on, Bulma-san..."
I've known your dad for how many years now?
"That reminds me, Bulma-san, how old will you be today?"
Ouch.
How rude.
Why would I ever tell you that?
.
"Oh, dear."
Wow.
I've never been on a cruise ship before.
You can tell they're the richest family in the world.
Goku-sa's sure got some great friends.
Is it true that you've prepared a castle and an... aeroplane as prizes for today's bingo contest?
"Yep, that's right."
But the Grand Prize is even better.
"""Grand Prize:"
"Secret"""
"All right, Kuririn."
"With Maron here, that makes three of us."
Let's make sure we go home with that second place castle.
Huh?
You're fine with just the second place prize?
Is second not high enough?
"Oh, I didn't mean it like that..."
"Oh, Goku-sa..."
Why'd you have to go training' at a time like this?
.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Is your mother back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Does your mother approve?
- Sure.
She always gives a lot herself.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize ...
Normally we don't take money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we can do it."
"Well, take a good look at how beautiful this house is."
They can afford it.
"As thanks for the donation, I have here a plaster."

Ellis?
You look so pale in corduroy.
Your friends are they?
I got a letter...from the Commission document bombed down in the provinces.
"An exhibition in London, straight after."
And that's for gallery.
Ellis!
Would there be Sunday trains do you think?
"Only that I need to get back to London, Monday mornings."
What are you talking about?
Coming to see you.
"You will be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course!"
After the script is finished.
Umm..get out of that actually.
I don't want to get out of it.
I don't want to let them down.
No. of course not.
"Now, I leave on Monday."
"Umm, I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not very far off.
No.
It's not so very far off.
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
"I ordered cutlets, Millenezi."
And Cimbalino pudding.
So...so you are Mr.Ambrose Hilliard?
Ye..yes.

It's 20 past.
It's just that in Spain we aren't as punctual as you.
But are you sure about what you're saying?
Yes.
"He was speaking with Himmler, I'm sure of it."
"He said: ""Dank, Heinrich"" and hung up."
And he's accepted everything.
We'll call the Ministry.
They will know what's going on in Montserrat.
"No, we're outside Spanish territory."
Our cell phones don't work here.
We'd have to return to Irun and there's no time.
But Amelia and her team are in this time.
We could get off and call from the station.
You're right.
I'm going to get off.
No.
They could call for you at any moment.
It would be suspicious if you weren't here.
I'll take care of it.
"But where do you think you are, Ramblas street market?"
Montserrat is a spiritual retreat.

"Actually, if I'm honest, things have gone to shit."

Oh.
"Oh, this is a wonder spot, Jeeves."
I bet this reeks with romance.
"- I hope not, sir."
- Yes.
"Anyway, it's a nice place for rest and quiet."
"I consider it the most peaceful spot in the whole of England, sir."
"Good egg, Jeeves, good egg."
I—
I wonder what's happened to our passenger.
That Ethiopian fellow seems to have evaporated.
"You'll probably find him down the road, sir, draped on a bush."
Do something about it because it worries me exceedingly.
I'll go and have lunch.
"Yes, sir."
Hello!
Hello!
"Yes, sir, Massa Gabriel, I's coming."

"Come, come."
We're there.

Leeds is many miles from here.
"Apologies, but I am in such a hurry."
Another one'll be along any mo.

Shit!
Don't let him in!
"No, I don't want my son's head pixelated all over the Sunday papers."
"Crown Street, thanks."
Where are your manners?
He'll tire of this woman.
Boys can't see straight with a hard-on.
No 15-year-old boy is going to tire of a woman shoving perfect tits in his face.

The war's over.
I thought we were all spending money again.
How was your day?
Would have been a considerable improvement.
I got a bottle of schnapps and half a rhubarb pie.
Let's see which one makes us sick first.
"Oh, sounds lovely, but I was just about to go to bed."
"It's 8:00, grandma."
Come on.
Tell me about your crappy day.
I'm really tired.
M-maybe some other time.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
"No, you didn't disturb me."
I ju...
"no, it's fine."
I know a brush-off when I see it.
Angie...
oh.
"Ah, miss carter, miss martinelli,"
"May I introduce you to our new resident,"
Miss dorothy underwood?
"Oh, call me dottie."
Nice to meet you.
"This place is pretty swell, huh?"
Hmm.
"Seems like one big, happy family."
"No, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Look, I keep telling you, I haven't got a girl."
- What's she like?
"- Oh, about 40."
I thought you said she was a girl.
- I wasn't referring to her age.
- Eh?
Oh.
Poor Henry.
"It never rains but it pours, hmm?"
I've never seen her before.
It's a lie.
- What?
- Whatever she says I've done.
- Oughtn't you go and find out?
"- Yes, I jolly well will."
And be careful.
You might fall.
- Good evening.
Did you want me?
- I'm sorry to come like this.
"I know you've done something dreadful, too, but you needn't pay a penny."
- What are you talking about?
- That beastly Dennis.
"Come here, will you?"
...and there were magazines on Sonny MacGregor and a lady called Ransom.
"Now I've nothing to lose, I'm going to expose everything."

You told her terrible things.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- lt's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.

"You know, the thing."

I'd be impressed if you had any friends.
"Right, that's it."

"- I don't know what you mean, sir."
- All right.
He saw you do it.
- Why did you?
- That's the signal.
Three cheers.
"- Next time, be careful."
- When are we gonna do it?
- The real thing?
- You'll be told.
We did what we said.

Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."

"No, I'm fine."

We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
Next day...
I woke up and... both my... my eyes were swelled up.
What did the doctors say?
I humbly ask you to tend to your children with love.
Deign to see the pain and suffering of my friend and those like him.
"Chun-su, what are you doing?"

They'll take everything away anyway.
I'd rather bum it myself.

Chun-su!
Please tend to my father's grave.
He's burned everything!
Who's next?
First old man Yim then his son Chun-su: who's next?
Say something!
Are you mute?
"Don't get involved, Father."
"Hush up, boy?"
Old man Yim was like family to us.
But we just let them take him.
"Heck, we didn't even go to his funeral because we were afraid!"
What do we have except our friends?
"If we lowly peasants don't stick together, who are we to trust and depend on?"
Who goes there!

"- Oh, my poor boy!"
"- Why do you say that, Doctor?"
"Well, it just occurred to me:"
You must be under tremendous emotional strain:
Strain?
No:
Why?

The Goral of your dreams!
You lost her!

Hold the line.
Exactly!
Everything about her is an action replay of my wife!
My heart says that too!
Get me my Laxmi!
Please!
"If Aunt gets to know of this, she'd be really offended."
Not at all!
D'you know what she threw at me today?
This!
The box?
That would break my head!
She threw a rose at me!
Did that fall on you?
"On my heart, actually."
Now look; suppose you're walking down the street...
But I'm standing here.
Just suppose so!
And a crow flying overhead drops excrement on your head.
Just suppose so!
"Will you fall for the crow, too?"
What a rotten joke!
"A crow and Laxmi, eh?"
I'll throw you out!
Just listen...
She's terribly angry with Durgaprasad which is why she threw the rose at you.
Durgaprasad?
Now who the hell is that?
I'm trapped...
"Her brother-in-law, eh?"
Not her brother-in-law.
He's her husband.
She said she was alone!
The marriage shall take place on the same day.
And it shall happen with Sheen only.
This is the farmhouse.
Okay brother!
"Be ready on time, tomorrow."
Okay?
- I shall get the priest.
- Okay!
- Bye!
Take care!
- Bye!
Are you okay?
Oh god!
You shied away?
The priest shall be on the way.
You shied away?
"""Every moment I look at you""."
"""Oh god, I desire you so much""."
"""Every moment I look at you""."
"""Oh god, I desire you so much""."
"""My simplicity and my shyness is all for you, my dearest""."
"""Silky is the moment, beautiful Is the fragrance""."
"""Silky is the moment, beautiful Is the fragrance""."
"""My dear, since the time I've met you""."
"Vishal, where are you?"
I'm waiting for you since long.
"Friend, we have brought Sheen's mother to the hospital."
I got to know that she had a heart attack.
"Don't know if we should tell her, or..."
You handle it.
"Faiz, is everything okay?"
Keep faith in god.
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"Ifl don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now-- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... ifyou are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Hereyou go, Doug."
My luckyvest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in foryou.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think ofit as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
- Yeah.
"What did you say, hysterical?"
Who?
Hello?
Hello!
It was me.
"I know, when my... husband behaves well, then I become a beast."
"I lose control, become inexplicable."
"I was sure that it was Gianni again, but I did not have... any inclination to speak nor to listen."
"Love, I tell you something:"
my cock is hard.
"Can you hear, beloved?"
I thought about it and I got a hard-on.
-That's the way it is!
-Who is talking?
-You are not Teresa.
"-Of course not, I am Rosella."
"So what, I have a hard-on."
So what can I do about that?
-Lend us a hand.
-Who allows you of using me?
"Sorry, I continued to believe you were Teresa."
"But I told you, I am Rosella."
"This is just as well, give me a hand, it is good."
What hand?
I do not understand.
"A hand, just a hand."
Indeed!
But you must pretend that my hand is yours.
-You are crazy!
"-Please, don't hang up."
I could not forget that voice.
It's sensuality prevented me.
"For all intents and purposes, it already happened."
(INHALES) I mean...
I'm in the room.
I don't look mad or pissed.
(CLEARS THROAT)
The painting's coming out great.
Yeah.
The painting's coming out great.
You probably asked us to do it for inspiration or something.
We're all friends.
And we just need to trust that it's going to be okay.
Fuck!
What the fuck was that for?
(SIGHS) That's for kissing my girlfriend tomorrow.
"T-minus one hour, in case you were wondering."
"Please, stop counting down like it's a fucking shuttle launch."
- Sorry.
- JASPER:
"Yeah, yeah."
I told you Crab Apple was a sure thing.
He just needed a few more races.
"Let's roll half the winnings into tomorrow's bets, and I'll come pick up the rest."
Uh-huh.
"Okay, yeah."
"Um, let me just get something to write on."
I thought there wasn't a bottle in the photo.
That's because it was down here.
"What time is it, babe?"
"Finn, you okay?"
"Yeah, uh, no."
It's this part of the painting-it's unfinished.
I'm clearly about to paint it.
I have to continue working or I'll be told off.
They love to play bite the cake.
And we've got games where they can win prizes.
"Niels, Arie's Niels."
I know where he is and what he's doing.
I got the guns.
We can finally kill him.
After 35 years.
I'm out.
-What?
I don't want to kill anybody anymore.
Why so ethical suddenly?
-Suddenly?
It's taken some time.
How many Krauts did you kill in those days?
"20, 30?"
There won't be another one.
Every life's precious.
"-Oh, come on."
"Once, I was going on holiday with my wife."
"We had a blowout, an accident."
Totally messed up.
"When I came to, I had so many tubes in my body, I looked like an octopus."
And your wife?
-Dead.
She had already been cremated when I came to.
And you married the nurse?
A bit of a cliché.
-Yes?
"Well, I've got another one for you."
"When I was laying in hospital, I thought life had to continue."
"I'd never wanted to have children, but ten months later... our eldest son was born."
"Oh, God."
Patti Nyholm.
"- Well, look at you."
- And you.
Poster child for Motherhood Today.
"You have no changing tables in the restroom, Will."
- It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
"- Yep, doing our part to suppress the birth rate."
"So, I need some legal advice on my contract."
"Oh, my God, wait."
You can't practice law any more.
What was I thinking?
"No, thank you."
"I'll be right out, Michael."
This'll take a few minutes.
"That must be really hard on you, Will, just sitting around watching all these lawyers while you're, what, surfing the Web?"
- Clipping coupons?
"- What's up, Patti?"
- A lawsuit.
- Really?
Which one?
A new one.
"It'll be great being on opposite sides again, dusting it up..."
"Oh, wait."
Darn it.
You're not a lawyer any more.
I keep forgetting.
So sorry I'm late.
Here's my lawyer now.
"Ms. Nyholm, I believe you know everybody."
I think I do.
Hello.
"- How can you say that, Uncle?"
"No matter how much you teach a donkey, it can never become a horse."
"- Come on, now!"
"- Phone for you, Baba."
"Yes, mother. I am coming."
Why?
What happened?
is everything fine?
Mother is feeling somewhat ill.
"Uncle, I am moving."
"All right, then, Uncle."
What happened?
The car has broken down.
Let's check what's wrong.
I don't understand what's wrong with it?
It's become a problem.
The problem has been solved.
Excuse me...
Did you think that person to be the hotel's doorman who parks cars?
No.
Then you give your car to strangers just like that?
There are some people who don't look like strangers in the first meetings too.
Do you believe that he will return?
He will return.
He will surely return.
A girl...and a car!
"How wonderful, Lord!"
I pray at the shrine.
But He gives everything to him.
Anyway...
"Mother, you are unwell."
"Still, you are sitting here?"
You can't just sit here.
Hello.
[dialing]
Yeah.
Chayton.
Chayton.
This is Otto Bernhardt.
Listen...
"Well, there's a fellow here in my office, and he refuses to leave."
"In fact, he refuses to even talk."
I suspect that he's here on your behalf.
"Actually, he's there for you, to help you make sure nothing happens to my money."
"Yeah, but that's... that's... that's really not necessary."
"I'll see you in the morning after my case is dropped, when I come to get what's mine."
Whew.
That's better.
Good to get out of those church clothes.
"I tried cleaning this up, but he about bit my head off."
"That's what marriage is, mostly... putting up with each other's shit."
[doorbell rings]
You expecting anyone?
I am.
- [knocking] - [door opens]
- I'm sorry to interrupt...
- Hi.
"... but, uh, this gentleman says he's here to see you."
Ah.
Dr. Barrett.
You met my grandson?
Just now.
"Yeah, if you need me,"
- I'll be in my room.
It'll soften the blow.
It doesn't matter what I do.
He is never going to forgive me.
Of course he will.
You're his only daughter.
He has to.
"Congratulations, by the way."
- Thank you.
- How's it going?
Good.
Good.
"Okay, talk to your father soon, please, because I need your help on Saturday with the Novack wedding."
They want five additional cakes.
Cakes.
Mom-- mom!
Mom.
What?
"You don't even ask anymore, you just assume?"
What if I have plans?
Do you?
- That's not the point.
- What's the point?
That I could have.
What time Saturday?
8:00 a.m.
I love you.
I don't know how to tell him.
"Honey, ever since you could crawl, you've been out to prove a point-- that you could do whatever your brothers could do, only you could do it better."
"And you've always been way too smart, except where it comes to your father."
You're 30 years old.
When are you gonna stop looking for his approval?
I thought we were going out.
"Do I need to make fun of ""Star Wars"" or something"
- to summon your angry nerd strength?
- I'm fine.
"[ Strained voice ] And anyone who makes fun of ""Star Wars"""
is just revealing their own cinematic ignorance.
- [ Chuckles ] Nerd speak.
- Whoa.
I don't remember having that in my storeroom.
"Yo, guys."
What's going on?
[ Chuckles ]
Why aren't you out at the party?
- The thing is...
- We're in a weird situation.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
"I get it, fellas."
It's okay.
"I mean, look, you're 17."
"Life's crazy right now, and the one thing you can really count on is your best friend."
It's natural to kiss a little.
"You know, just see if it feel all right."
Dude!
We're not gay.
We didn't kiss.
"Uh, duh!"
[ Laughs ]
I did not kiss my best friend in high school either.
At all.
Ever.
"We are always pulling back a strange new layer on you, aren't we?"
This is just the greatest night!
"Don't be afraid, let him have a rest only."
Let some get fat only kilo.
Did you see that he ate the in crumbs chicken two times?
"Well...what right, it right."
"Ow, my mother, my mother,my sweet good mother, why you left me?"
!
Ow!
What is it?
Was somebody wounded?
"Nothing happened, major lord."
As if I would have heard a groan.
Well...
I was it.
As if somebody would have kept recalling his mother.
Well...is an a kind of bad habit only.
I like stretching out and then very...
I gtoan.
Yes?
I am really glad about this.
He fidget.
Why are you surprised at this?
100 mortal dangers is every day.9 months are in constant noise and smelliness.
"Well...what right, it right."
Let's go.
Let us lie.
Enough were the today's day already.
What was that?
Who's here?
Stop!
Who are you?
Major lord.
This evening is beautiful.
I could show you around the country.
We'd always be together.
"If I could live here, I wouldn't have to rent the place in town."
You didn't sell yourself well as a prospective roommate.
- What do you mean?
- You should know!
Gerd is still looking for new ski instructors.
- I don't want to.
- Why not?
- I have enough to do.
- You could earn a lot more.
I earn just as much with the translations.
"""Forest Ranger's Love""..."
"""Hour of Desire."""
You'd be a great ski instructor.
But I don't want to.
Ridiculous!
- What?
- Your attitude.
You never try anything new.
- What'll I tell Gerd?
- What about?
- Your refusal.
Where did you get that idea anyway?
- I told him.
- What?
For your sake.
You'd earn twice as much.
"Thanks, but I'm grown up."
"Oh, yeah?"
Don't you ever want to achieve anything?
You can talk!
- You are the...?
- That's right.
I am the babysitter.
"Yes, yes."
Thank goodness that you've come.
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy, I've got three little ogres at home."
This will be a piece of cake.
Father.
Father!
"- OK, then."
"- Look, I'm telling you."
I've tried every trick in the book.
You see?
"""Once Upon A Time-Out""?"
"Oh, come on, now."
- You're gonna listen to a goose?
- Please.
You don't understand.
It's like he's two different people.
"What your kid needs is discipline, not a bunch of psychological mumbo jumbo."
"You just gotta walk in there, look him in the eye, and show him who's..."
Please tell me he's an only child.
Bubblegum fish pants...
Hello.
"Well, here's your problem."
His head's not screwed on right.
"When you wish upon a star, you get lots of stuff."
"Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening where you go to sleep and I raid the icebox."
OK.
"Good, plenty of rocks around."
"Good morning, daddy!"
So the young 'uns are up already.
"A beautiful good morning, miller."
Good morning...
wait...my cap... wait!
"'Morning, master."
How do we go about it?
Only a couple of sacks...
"You'll manage those on your own, Furface."
Johann can clean the dung out of the goat-shed.
- Dung?
Me?
- Dung.
Such swarms of them!
"Our boys'll fight like lions, your Highness."
- They had tough training.
- Our boys'll be killed.
We're far outnumbered!
They'll beat us just with their turbans!
Where're you from?
"From far away, Bohemia."
Bavorov.
Really?
My wife comes from Netolice.
"That's quite close, across the wood."
D'you think we can make them run?
How dare you doubt our victory!
It looks like my tough training did no good.
I'll show you!
Lock him up!
You won't forget me in a hurry.
[baby babbling on speaker]
[Betty muttering on speaker]
"When Cassie shows up, remember, all you have to do is believe."
And don't limit yourself to what you can see.
You know?
"I mean, we can't see the air."
- Hmm.
- Does that make the air less fucking real?
No.
- What page?
- 16.
"Jesus Christ, you're a slow reader."
Yeah.
"Oh, here we go."
"[Cassie] Oh, hey, ""kiss and run."""
"P.S., uh, I lied, those were my balls."
You're welcome.
Hello.
- [groans] - [chuckles]
"Uh, look um, fuck it."
I'm not gonna apologize for kissing you.
"I did what I did, and..."
that's that.
So.
[inhales] Yep.
- [sighs] - [chuckles]
"Ahh, well, that's way too long of a pause."
"I've overplayed my hand, haven't I?"
"Look, despite almost losing a tooth on impact, the kiss was nice."
You running away was fucking weird.
"Yeah, I think I used up, uh, all my adrenaline on the kiss, and I...had to hide in the men's room until closing to recharge."
[both laughing]
Because this property is sold.
And any trespasser will be executed.
You get that baby.
Yes.
Excuse me Vishal.
But our film's just begun.
Oh!
Let the film's begun... then the hero's got to hold the heroine's hand.
Leave my hand Vishal.
Oh so sweet.
Or else?
Move.
Move.
Move.
I hit him.
Watch out.
Shiv are you okay?
Ankita this is a big problem.
The real problem will start when brother finds out.
Come on.
Come on keep walking.
Why bring us here sir?
I tried explaining nicely but you wouldn't listen.
If you go against Minister Pradhan and... roam around like a big oaf you'll be put down like a dog.
There's just one way to save yourselves.
Kill me and escape.
Don't try to run from death.
People have a wrong notion about death.
Its life that makes you suffer.
Garbage cleared.
My record's also cleared.
Mr. Pradhan your job's done.
-But it's a scientist.
-And what's his name?
-Doctor Yansky.
Hallo.
This is attendant Zero.
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
I repeat.
"This is attendant zero, barrier 173."
Doctor Yansky come to the exit of the reservation.
You caused this.
What a mission!
-You are an interplanetary bungler.
-Let it go.
"Look, everybody drives, but we are going on foot."
This way we will never look like people.
-And would you like it?
"-Well... they are better, prettier."
Look at me.
Never in my life have I looked better.
"In contrast to it, out there at home, how do we look?"
It's better not to speak about it!
The ridiculous antennae.
Horror!
"I'm telling you, I'm considering whether or not to stay like this."
All right.
Normally we look hideous.
That's a fact.
On the other hand we can travel where we want.
Yoohoo!
Come for a ride!
All over space.
And that's a fact too.
-Yeah!
Are you just gonna let him shove you like that?
Come on.
Come on.
Ow!
"Jesse I just don't want to make the same mistake I've made in the past, so"
I just want to come right out and say it.
I'm Hannah Montana.
Eh?
"[Mimicking Jesse] Whoa dude, stop, you're blowing my mind!"
"I mean, you're Hannah, you're Miley, you're Hannah."
Who am I dating?
You're tearing me apart.
Will you stop?
Will you?
Why are we even rehearsing this?
I mean you've told the secret enough times.
I'm surprised the pizza delivery guy doesn't know.
Mmm-hmm.
"""Who ordered the meat lovers special?"" ""I did and I'm Hannah Montana!"""
Oh stop sulking.
You've been mad ever since I told Siena about the secret.
She didn't know who Lola was!
Get over it!
All right look at me!
I wear Day-Glo wigs.
I dress like a Japanese cartoon character.
How can she not know who Lola is?
Come on she's dating Jackson.
She's one drumstick short of a jumbo bucket.
Now can we get back to the person with the real problem?
[Gasps] Lola's real to me.
"Well, you sirs show no patriotism."
Fine english fabrics!
"Fine english fabrics, Mr Biberkopf!"
I'd rather hope so!
I could never fool myself.
Stop tickling me!
I'll have someone pick my rags up later.
Mieze!
Look!
Be astonished!
- You look very fine!
- Look at me!
Clothes make the man!
- Now it's your turn!
- No no no!
Oh come on!
"Business is going well so we can afford decent clothes, can't we?"
- You'll get your money!
Goodbye.
- I hope so.
Goodbye Mr Biberkopf.
2 bottles of sparkling wine!
Where is the party?
- Knew it!
"- Just some ""celebrities""."
"No, I already told you I won't come along."
I'm not dressed accordingly.
It's your choice.
"Guys like us, looking fine."
I'm not gonna let Franz walk all over me.
"Just watch out for him, he might cause trouble for us with his money-spending habit"
He's an amateur!
Congratulations!
She's a great...
Yes.
I've heard so much about you.
- Likewise about you.
- We all ought to...
"Had I known you were this good-looking,"
I'd have answered the ad for myself.
Congratulations.
She's the best.
"If I were a man, I'd be all over her."
Congratulations.
I'm sure you'll both be very fascinating to watch.
"Rose, isn't it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?"
- I know what you mean.
- I can't believe it.
And the dust!
This place needs a good cleaning.
We'll take care of that.
I made room for your books.
Need any help?
Everything's put in its place.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to bed.
To sleep...
"In order to sleep, you go to the bed for sleeping."
- Unless you want to do something else.
- What?
I wasn't going to say anything.
Do you want the bathroom first?
"- No, I can wait."
"- No, you go."
Riding horses.
I've been riding all my life.
Get down!
Get dressed.
How about giving me back those Indian charms of mine?
"They're just sentimental value, nothing more."
"Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff and bring it up here, will you?"
Anything else you want?
"- Well, my rifle."
- No.
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.
You getting all choky seeing me behind bars?
God damn you.
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.
- The paper said they're charms.
"- Yeah, they are."
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.
Who are those fellows out there with those rifles?
That's the National Guard.
The paper said they didn't think we could hold you in jail... and they got kind of personal about it.
"Open this thing up, Earl."
Let us in.
John Coble's here to see Tom.
Here you go.
John brought you a suit to wear at the trial.
"All right, you fellows can have about 10 minutes."
"Come on, Earl."
"Gigi, he's not coming."
But you can tell me the story about the molars.
I'd love to hear it.
Hey.
How could he already not like me?
I screwed up.
"I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday."
It's my fault.
Hi.
Are you good?
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.
GIGI:
Awesome.
I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
"Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak."
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.
"Oh, God, no."
How do you know?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
"She's interested, he's clearly not."
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
"Actually, I can."
I see this stuff going on every night.
Watch this.
She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
"He's thinking, ""Dear Christ, get me out of here."""
"And look, how fortuitous."
"Drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now..."
He can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
"Man, you have a gift."
Helen:
Okay.
Are you really serious about this?
"I told your dad, Grandpa was gone, but now you coming into our lives and digging up this case, well, that was the last time"
"Dad and Duval were ever civil to each other, so now I think he might still be here."
"Just holding on, something left to do."
All right.
Come on.
Both of you.
Fingers on.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
Close your eyes.
"Sheriff James Pritchard, if you are here, make your presence known."
James Pritchard.
Are you with us?
[Door slams]
You.
Outside.
Right now.
[Door opens]
They sure do this a lot.
Maybe they like it.
"When we were kids, your grandpa would take your dad out there when he was in trouble."
I can't imagine Dad in trouble.
Yeah.
They'd stand there just... like that.
Duval:
Why are you here?
I told you to stay away from my house.
You'd only come if you had leverage.
I'd only come?
- You're kidding me.
- You're squandering my money.
You've been studying for seven years and you're only half way through.
- I'II get it together.
- Marry Michelle or earn your living.
- But dad...
- It's all arranged.
"You get a car, a house, and 25000 a month."
You can't force me to marry her.
The wedding is in two months.
Your friends are not welcome.
And your mother says she's waiting for some grandchildren.
"Hey, Marc?"
"What are you doing, you fucking faggot?"
"- Fuck you, bitch."
- What's going on?
He tried to kiss me.
- Have you seen Sofie?
- She was dancing.
I thought you'd finished with her.
- It's nearly closing time.
- There are still five on the list.
Who hasn't gone yet?
I saw Christian and Johannes.
Johannes is too drunk for it.
Will you do Christian?
I am too sore.
"- Of course, baby."
- Thanks.
How do you feel about your mum and dad?
- What are you doing?
- Why won't he talk to her?
Binding over boyfriend is key.
- Here's some water.
"- Great, she'll need some."
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I have some mints.
I'll leave them here.
"I'm okay, I just..."
- I gotta get back to work.
"- No, you go home."
I'll put you in a cab.
Here you go.
"- She's sick, buddy."
Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
Listen.
"Go home, cuddle up and get some rest."
Youve gotta take better care.
You're working too hard.
- Come on.
"- Thank you so much, Paul."
"See you on Monday on Romeo and Juliette, okay?"
Slamming into the windshield won't win you any... model contract.
This is Resin... telling you to buckle up because safety is so in fashion...
What?
"I can see the dresses have arrived for Juliette... beautiful, sensuous, feminine."
"Thanks, Dianne, you are a goddess."
"Remember, child:"
Life is love and love is life.
"Whining, yet charming."
New York subway in the summer.
Meteorology: 112 degrees.
Get in and out as quickly as you can.
That's all.
"Well, good luck, everybody, if all else fails just tread on their blank blank fingers."
"Where you go, I go."
Dawes.
Corporal Dawes?
My legs.
My legs!
"Quick as you can, Sergeant Box."
"Well, why don't you kiss it?"
"Get a ruddy move on yourself, man."
Engelander!
"Sergeant Box, how much longer are you going to be?"
It's nearly five to six.
It'll be dawn soon.
Hurry up.
Don't you know there's a war on?
"And you, Sergeant Box."
"Quick, we don't want to keep the Navy waiting."
"All right, Sir, just coming."
"You two stick close to Sergeant Box, don't let him out of you sight."
"Yes, Sir."
"Hurry up, will you?"
Hurry down those ropes!
Fire!
"Come on, get this fellow out of here, into the cave."
Any luck with this machine?
Not a whisper.
If the Navy find us in this soup...
What's happening to the Navy?
Looks like a long swim home.
Do you swim?
Yesterday's fireworks are still echoing.
"So, no thanks."
Brilliant.
"And now, if you're done with your story... please get out of my house!"
Your house?
Wow!
"But, I believe this house isn't yours, it belongs to Tisha."
"And, I believe Tisha is no more."
Do you think you're the only one who can create an illusion?
Tisha is alive.
I'm very happy to hear that.
"Anyway, if you had any kind of proof then..."
We do have proof.
Your fingerprints.
What?
You heard me.
Your fingerprints.
They are on the key.
When we were banging on the door...
Mr. Malhotra?
Mr. Malhotra?
You said the key was in the keyhole.
"The key is in the keyhole, but he never locks the door."
And we believed you.
And when you realised I would break the door down... you made your move.
"Hammer... quick, come on."
This is your proof?
!
Of course my fingerprints were on the key.
"I turned the key to open the door, remember?"
"Yes, I remember."
"Then, explain this."
That's when they get into trouble.
H i.
M ind if I?
You might as well turn it off.
No. I like it.
This is hard.
We need to talk.
"When I was twelve, my mother gave me my sex talk, I'm not sure either of us has fully recovered,"
- Now that you and Jordan are--
- Oh my God.
"Mom, please."
Angela. I can accept that you have a boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Fine.
A pal.
A male pal.
Whatever word you want to choose.
The point is...
"I'm your mother, and I don't think you're ready."
"- Mom, please."
- l don't think you're ready.
But...
I have to know if this is what's happening...
because I don't think that I keep you from--
"- Mom, I beg you to stop."
"- l need to know that you are using-- l mean, I remember how this feels, I do..."
but it's the times that we live in...
"- Mom, please."
- Honey...
"I know you do not want to think about these things, I know..."
- you think you are invulnerable...
- l don't think that--
"Russian, Polish, I've got no idea."
Everybody's having a good time.
How did he get this off the wall?
I think the girls will hold out for quite a while.
"Let's do ""Russian Nights"" then."
We could do whatever we want.
They're really good!
"Good then, we'll have ""Russian nights""."
It doesn't exist?
There is no quiz show.
But you showed it to me?
That was just a starting point.
The starting point was good.
What a night!
"If you ask me, I personally prefer classical music."
You've been pouring the beer really well lately.
Lately?
I'm serious.
I'm heading out.
Then of course there are the fjords.
Wasn't that Norway?
They're everywhere up there.
Everywhere?
Everywhere.
"It's all one big fjord up there, if you ask me."
"Green, green, green."
And water.
Really.
You can believe it.
"Lucy, I just need five minutes of your time for my new client."
"Oh, my gosh, she look ridiculous."
"""Well, uh,"
"""that bitch gets a lot of exposure."
"""I mean, because, uh, uh, uh..."
"""uh, we all want to sleep with her."
"""Uh, me, Sasha, Malia."
"""Even my dog wants to hit that."
"""As a matter of fact, if I get caught, uh..."
"""with Kim Kardashian, uh..."
"""uh, well, Michelle's just gotta let some shit slide."
"""Uh, I mean, come on, everybody."
"""Uh, her skin is soft."
"""Uh, she looks good."
"And, uh, that ass is bigger than the deficit."""
"Aw, man, I would love to see that dude in the strip club."
That'd be hilarious.
"He just be in the strip club, he be..."
"""Well, uh, thanks"
"""for bringing me here, Joe."
"""Uh, we gotta get a selfie with some of these asses."
"""Uh, hashtag it 'Obama-rama.'"
"""Uh, I can get her to come over here if you want me to."
"""She knows who the hell I am."
"""All right, let me get her."
"""Uh, Peppermint, come here."
"""Uh, come on, sit down right here."
"""Now, uh, my friend here, Joe Biden,"
"""he's, uh, he's pretty shy."
"""But he wants you to know that, uh,"
"""you're very beautiful, and, uh--oh!"
"""He won't make it rain."
"Uh, he'll make it Hurricane Sandy up in this bitch."""
"Now, my fantasy pick for a president would be Eddie Murphy."
"Come on, Nami."
What's wrong?
No!
OK. I understand.
What happens is nothing to do with me!
Nothing whatsoever.
Who could do this?
Is she a porn model?
That can't be allowed.
I'm wondering what I should do as her supervisor.
There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case.
She's just a slut.
Yes.
It can't be tolerated.
Trust is very important in this industry.
Lay her off.
Of course.
"She looked nice, though."
Come with me.
No.
You're working at the department store?
Have you been following me?
What's wrong?
Has something happened to you?
Stop talking as if you're a friend.
Take this umbrella.
You should go home now.
I just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this.
I didn't intend to do anything like that.
Leave me alone.
I've had just about enough of it.
Please be quiet.
She doesn't want to see me anymore
And i don't want to see her either.
"Look, i'm not gonna keep arguing with you about this."
"Michelle, you need to fix it."
- You don't need to keep...
- You need her.
Don't need to keep what?
"Hi, regina."
So what do i owe to this displeasure?
You know what?
I told you this wasn't a good idea.
See?
"I'm sorry to bother you, regina,"
May we please come in for a second?
We will not stay long.
I promise.
"Well, my day couldn't get any worse."
Come on in.
Get going.
so i brought michelle here
Because i think we all have some things we need to clear up.
Michelle told me what happened and...
And i'm sure she gave you
Her twisted version of things.
"Look, regina, i am tired of you disrespecting me."
"First i'm stupid, now i'm twisted?"
- You know what?
Let's go.
"- First, regina..."
Shh-Tch!
"First, regina,"
I want to apologize for any misunderstandings
Sylvia coming over?
You're not going to believe what happened. I gotta tell you that.
-What are you laughing at?
-Problem with the apartment?
That's an attitude I don't appreciate.
"As it turns out, I got an-- l do have a problem at my apartment."
-A gas leak.
-l didn't say anything.
But what's that?
What's that goofy grin for?
"What, you think I'd destroy my own gas installation?"
It's gonna get repaired.
It may take a few days...
... butyouknowthe way thingsare with utilities.
"Hey, the point is, is that I'm ready for her to come over."
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Good for you.
Yeah.
"Great, the Amazing Hulk."
"Detective, I owe you an apology."
I shouldn't have gotten in your face.
I was out of line.
-No problem.
-Bygones be bygones?
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe you'd put in a good word for me with Janice Licalsi.
"If she knows we're cool, she might let me up."
-She put in to ride with someone else.
-l think you need to talk to her about that.
Mm-hm.
"Okay, no problem."
"Give me 20 minutes a day, I could get you tightened up in a month."
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-l'm stirring it.
"-Listen, you know what to do?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois!"
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it!
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
I know what to do.
"Hey, you little hick, just make sure you do it!"
You're such a pain.
-Hey!
Just do it!
-Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.
So what does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
She calls from the house.
If anyone was listening they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd have the flight number.
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to watch on the stove.
All day long the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
And you know what?
I'm gonna help you find your time capsule!
"Not tonight, though, 'cause sean and darrin are coming over,"
"And we're punching each other in the stomach,"
"You know, firming up the core,"
But tomorrow we're gonna find that time capsule!
"Oh, hey, Brick."
"Hey, when are you supposed to get your math test back?"
"Oh, I already got it."
Whoa.
Hold on.
How'd you do?
"Some might call it a very low ""d."""
Some might call it a d-minus.
What?
You did worse?
"Well, I was confident going in."
"Eh, well."
What are you gonna do?
This is nuts.
What do you think happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Ms. Rinsky is what happened.
She's just a bad teacher!
Mm.
Could be.
"She intimidates people, mike."
I experienced it firsthand.
You can't do math
"With those cold, dead eyes staring at you."
Brick probably melted down just like I did.
Probably.
-It's warming.
-I'm just going to the bathroom.
"We are the first from our galaxy, to enjoy this feeling."
An uplifting feeling.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Nature will do you good.
I will arrive after you...
Don't lose your temper.
You know it's bad.
"You'll take a rest, everything will be like before."
"My little bunny will go to a nice forest,"
"snuggle down, yes, snuggle down..."
"Tell me, why don't you follow the program?"
"Who's the lady, Doctor?"
What have you done now?
"Yirinka, please!"
These are only friends.
Yirinka!
Never get married doctor.
It's terrible!
Yirinka...
Enough!
"Guys, I surrender!"
I'm a goner.
Look at me.
I don't sleep.
I wanted to sleep with the lady!
"That is, get married!"
"And getting married, doctor, does it relate somehow to reproduction?"
Go away.
Go away!
We're talking about the perfect dream of a school.
- Okay.
- Animals instead of science.
Chickens and mice and iguanas.
"This is pretend, right?"
"No, angel, this is real."
I am going to find you a school with trees and frogs and eggs to gather.
"And maybe just a little bit of math, because you do need that, too."
"But... not too much, okay?"
It's Auntie Mara.
Can I say hello?
Of course.
"I miss you, Auntie Mara."
"I miss you to smithereens, little one."
Are they torturing you to make me do an interview?
With hot needles.
"Tell them three minutes, no questions about Tom, and, I'll call it an exclusive, tell the rest of the world to suck eggs."
- Mommy!
Language!
- Acceptable!
Borderline.
I'm on my way.
- But after I make these cookies.
"- Okay, bye."
This tough cookie.
You...
Maybe we should just eat the batter.
That's my favorite part.
What do you think?
"Hey, Ruby Tuesday."
It's me.
Come in.
"Aw, good-bye, precious."
"If it wasn't for my Ed's darned old allergy,"
I'd get one just like you.
(chuckles)
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-Okay, Trix."
"Now, listen here, I want to tell you something."
"I have got work to do, and I have to do it right now."
I don't want you getting it into your head that all I have to do all day long is just play with you.
So it's back in the box.
Okay?
There.
Oh...
Don't look so sad about it.
"Come on, we'll go in the bedroom."
(door opens)
"- Hey there, Alice."
"-Oh, hi, Ed."
Aren't you coming home a little early today from work?
"Oh, no, I been, uh, showing up to work an hour early."
- We're breaking in a new man there.
-Oh?
Been with us a week-- he's still wet behind the ears.
(groans)
"Say, tell me, Alice, has Ralph, uh, tried to get in touch... (sharp exhale)"
Excuse me.
Has Ralph tried to get in touch with y... (sneezes)
- No.
Bless you.
-Excuse me.
Has he tried to get in touch with you about anything today?
No.
Chat up in the morning!
Death in the afternoon.
You're almost as pretty as my mother!
You should have let me know.
It was easier to take the train!
In which hole did you fall?
It was a woman who was being courted by a gangster!
I spent the night with her.
I don't know where she is.
I came here.
Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
I lost my luggage!
"My mom's picture, my father's last letter, his tie, handkerchiefs too!"
I don't know where!
"""I loved her""."
That's not the truth.
She touched me... moved me...
You remind me of your father.
"He was handsome, your father."
"You always fall for beauty, especially when it doesn't buckle."
What use are your truths?
Does they wash whiter?
My shirt.
It was the journey.
The night.
The rain... the rain...
"Do you get a kick out of it, or is it just stupidity?"
I kick stupidity?
Stupidity!
"And when your mother came to Paris for the last time,"
I knew I'd never see her again.
I tried to talk myself into believing she was happy.
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, what's that?"
"- Dr. Klein gave me this, calorie counter."
"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."
Come in.
Emily?
"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
Howard?
"Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
I didn't realize you were here.
"Yeah, I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and you should."
"Well, I can come back later."
"I just, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Lady.
"Hey, lady, you okay?"
(SOBBING)
"Yeah, they're gone, it's okay."
How can I ever thank...
You're one of them!
(SCREAMING)
"Not her type, I guess."
Maybe it's the eyes.
Or the fangs.
Well?
I'm feeling so...
NOAH:
I see.
Sunlight has no effect on you.
Extraordinary.
So you're a Daywalker. I never really thought they existed.
I'm a human being.
BLADE:
Why did you help me?
"Well, it's not every vampire that would apologize to his victims."
You were there?
"Well, after all, lam a vampire hunter."
I know their feeding grounds.
I hate this.
Every day I have to live with these cravings is a day too long.
But I've got a score to settle before I can leave this world behind.
Must be important for you to prolong a life you so detest.
Have you ever come across or heard of a vampire known as the Man with Four Fangs?
"No, I can't say that I have."
He killed my mother.
Of course I am.
Take your hands off me.
- Sir?
Am I in error?
- Thank heaven you're here.
- You can see I'm a gentleman.
- Look at his lovely clothes.
"- Take him, Dawlish."
- But you can't.
"- Vizard, you sail tomorrow?"
"- Yeah, Mediterranean."
- So you should count us out for now.
- No need.
Spread word to that fleet.
"If both fleets struck at once, we'd win our demands overnight!"
"- You'll act soon, then?"
"- Yes, soon every ship will mutiny."
- Before spring?
- Depends.
How's your crew?
Forty more pledges.
- We have half the ship already.
- Good.
"Poor men, driven like cattle."
I don't understand it.
Having to be pressed to go to sea?
- Not everyone wants to leave home.
- Think of it!
Sailing the Defiant and fighting the French.
You sound just like your father.
"Anyway, the admiral may not agree to let you go."
Father's back.
Driven.
So let's meet up tonight.
9PM.
Alright.
I am really in a hurry.
See you bro.
Okay.
"This work is from my friend, Lisa."
She's having a gallery exhibition in New York.
Extremely urgent.
And this is part of her exhibition.
It's installation art.
And it needs some retouching.
Everything needs to be done quickly.
It's so urgent that I thought of you first.
"On this planet, no one but you could finish it in time."
Day 1
You have 2 weeks.
But you must send an update every day.
And Lisa will give you her feedback right the way.
No problem.
Kai.
"But this job, you must do solo."
Because she is very paranoid about her work leaking.
"If you can do this job, the Shibuya job Jerd did will pale in comparison."
"When you're done, let's go to New York together."
Day 2
"Yes, Peng?"
I sent you the feedback for the previous lot already.
Is this lot done?
Not yet.
Why are you so slow?
Here.
Any time.
Thanks.
Uh...
where do I start?
The first step is admitting to someone that you love and trust that you're powerless before your addiction.
That's not going to be easy.
"No, it's going to hurt like hell, but the program works, it really does."
Hi there.
STONETREE:
So how do we know it's the same killer?
Similar MO.
Kills with the victim's... choice of drug.
"Uh, Lewis..."
mind if I bum one?
Thanks.
If the killer knows their addictions...
He knows them pretty well.
"Maybe very well, if you know what I mean."
When?
Fairly close to the time of death.
After the meeting?
Yep.
How about the last victim?
"Uh-huh, that's why I checked."
Okay.
Well...
"Let's make some connections, uh..."
"Do we have the, uh... members' last names?"
"Yeah, and the telephone numbers."
Sign-in sheet from the meeting.
"Though, I got to tell you, I feel a bit like Judas."
Wonderful.
Great.
Um...
"So, a little bit about me."
"Uh, my service is called"
"""Goldilocks and the Three Dates."""
Katy...
I forgot to tell her not to tell you that.
"So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by."
"I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is ""too hard,"""
"and maybe one is ""too soft."""
But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right.
- Katy...
- Get after it.
You're losin' him.
Okay.
"Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself."
It's impolite to talk about yourself.
Keeps his truck clean.
Loves his dogs.
Enjoys a beer and a smoke.
Beer...
Beer and smoke.
That's...
"Wow, you know."
I get it.
Rustic.
"Trucks, got it."
We will make this work.
"I love it, okay."
"And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship?"
You shouldn't air your dirty laundry.
I'd rather be stuffed in a coffin.
I don't mind the shooting. I wouldn't give much if you couldn't defend yourself but jumping bail is another thing.
It isn't square.
I want you to go into town and stand trial on your own feet.
Clear yourself or take the consequences.
"That's the only way to work it out, Brock."
"When you've got something more to say to me, I'll be around."
"That was nice, that was fine."
-Take it easy.
-You can hurt him more than anyone.
"-You know that, don't you;"
-Take it easy.
I thought you were leaving.
I gotta think.
How can a man think without a little music;
-Jim here;
-Around someplace.
"-Out back, I guess."
-Where's Brock;
"Hello, Mr. McCurtin."
"-You tell them about the shooting, Brock;"
"-Oh, hello, Mac."
"Sure, I told them."
What's the matter;
Horton died.
-l figured he was too mean to die.
"-l can get you off, once more, maybe."
You must've had good reason to shoot a man.
"You had one, didn't you;"
Good reason;
"-Why, sure, the best."
-Better come back in with me.
"All of sudden she.said, ""Excuse me'"
"I said, yes please?"
"She said, ""My watch isn't working."
"Could you tell me the time?"""
I know.
This is an outdated idea to start a conversation.
Quite possible her watch must have stopped working.
You are unnecessarily suspecting her.
- No need to advocate for her.
What happened next?
- What else?
I told her the time.
Again there was a silence.
There was no sign ofthe bus.
I decided to walk. I had just put a step ahead and she said...
"""Listen""."
"-l said, yes, tell me."
"She said, ""You are leaving me alone over here"""
"""l am scared to be alone."
"Can you drop me home?"""
Why?
Was the bus-stop in a forest?
-Not exactly.
But she was afraid.
I told her to come along.
Then we started walking.
I felt like the poor thing was a bit tired.
"You know there are benches on the footpath, don't you?"
I told her to sit down for a few moments.
She sat down.
Then I saw that she was staring at me.
I asked Meena whatthe matter was.
The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive."
But I doubt she'll cooperate.
She's also stronger and faster than any Wraith I've ever seen.
Great!
All this time.
We thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us.
And I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Zaddik's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you!
"Dr Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you!
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!
Teyla.
"OK, long story, short version."
I was going to marry his ex-wife.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?
!
"What, and now you're mates, and everything?"
"(CHUCKLES) Well, mates is probably pushing it."
So where is she?
"His ex, your missus?"
She died.
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.
You weren't to know.
- What about you?
How do you know him?
- Don't.
Not really.
"As far as I'm concerned, he's this random smurf popped up out of nowhere."
So why the...?
Long time ago my dad killed this girl.
"It was by accident and everything, but... he panicked."
Cut her up and whatnot.
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
"So this bloke, Luther, was one of the coppers that put him away."
And your dad?
Killed himself in prison.
"Jenny, listen, I know how hard..."
how hard it can be.
Losing someone that way.
When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You fuckin' piece of shit!
"Die, you motherfucker!"
Look at me!
Look into my fuckin' eyes.
Die!
I hoped to find him recovered and so I'd explain to him everything.
But when he came back...
I won't say he was worse.
It's not that.
But he was a total helpless person.
I don't know what would he told you.
He told me the same.
I couldn't leave him in that spot.
It was a terribly unfair situation for me.
I thought that with me by his side I could help him.
How is Luisa?
Who told you about Luisa?
I heard from mom.
"Well, from Berta."
She was talking to her.
"What a lousy, filthy bad omen bird she is!"
What's omen?
"It's a sign, a premonition..."
I sense your eyes like dark violets...
Who wrote that?
Mine.
-It's beautiful.
And why wouldn't it be?
Are you gonna write more poetry?
I don't know.
What did Berta say about Luisa?
"That she's a whore, more or less."
But why do you care?
And what did your mother say?
Nothing.
"She said she knew you were dating some girl already, but she didn't know her."
And Berta said she was very tall and young.
"-Look, they're red on the inside."
-Nice.
-Look at that.
"-Quite cool, huh?"
You look like some sort of sexy secretary.
"Let's move out, men!"
e've got days off scheduled.
"Hey, have fun going home."
"See you later, yeah?"
"Have a fun flight home, you."
"I'II try but I'II miss you too much, Liam!"
See you later!
hello!
spend every single day with these lads.
t's really weird to not have the other four lads around me.
But do actually look forward to going home.
"Sing it, O2!"
"Let me hear you, London!"
How we doing in the back?
So baby if you say You want me to drive o KFC
I Iove chicken.
I Iike holmes chapel.
Pretty much every other part of my Iife has changed apart from coming down here.
It's just exactly the same.
My first kiss was down there.
"I kissed a girl, Iike, a bit further down."
"We were, Iike, against a tree."
It was pretty steamy.
"Come on, come on."
He just missed an open goal!
"Oh, we're gonna catch this."
e don't realise how much we appreciate our family and hometown until you're gone.
They're so much better than regular bars because worse is better.
"I know, right?"
"They're my favorite, too."
I'm quirky like that.
I've got quirky taste.
I'm a quirky girl.
It seems like we would be perfect for each other.
But really we're terrible for everyone.
ANNE MURRAY:
♪ And though I...
What the hell?
Are you listening to Anne Murray?
"Uh, I am experiencing Anne Murray."
Why?
That music is complete crap.
"Um, excuse me?"
"It's all just vapid, overproduced tripe."
It has no edge whatsoever.
"Yeah, neither does a soft summer breeze, or a letter from an old friend."
I'm pretty sure envelopes have edges.
"Fine, an e-mail."
Dick.
Whatever.
You know what?
I don't care.
"I think Anne Murray sucks, and that's my opinion."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, I'm going to make a believer out of you, Brian."
I am going to show you the true meaning of Anne Murray.
"Don't waste your time, I'm not going to change my mind."
"I don't know, Bri, I can make things happen when I want to."
Just ask my twin brother.
"You didn't believe in me, and you still don't."
one shouldn't be crawling on all fours like a worm.
My star!
"Venom is a bit scrunched, but still alive!"
Reliable sources blame the Armenians!
A bit skittish they are now.
Venom was probably dealing with some big Turkeys!
That's more honorable!
"Mickey Micheyan sewed the shit, now he has to drink it."
"They're assholes, those kids."
"It's the moon, Mercury."
"Mickey, he's a marked man."
The stars are my thing.
You've got the jitters?
Wanna split?
There's a door behind.
I couldn't.
- Because of her?
- Yes.
What's her ass got that mine hasn't?
She's fragile.
That's all in your head.
And your head is here.
"You, the slut!"
"And you, the missionary, you wait long before you get it!"
Here they come!
My comrades...
"It's not the same syndicate, commissioner."
It's private here.
"It's not them, detective."
The landlord assured me they've been here since 9.
"Oh, I know these guys."
"Maybe I should've listened to you, Seth, and done it the way you said."
"Come on, don't talk like that."
- We're gonna get you help.
- Seth.
"Seth, I can save him."
- No.
- He was right.
This world  ain't the same no more.
[laughs weakly]
I don't even know what that was.
Hey... hey.
I thought I could handle anything you two punks throw at me.
But I ca...
I can't dance on this dance floor no more.
"You were right, Seth."
Time for me to hang up my wingtips.
[sobbing] No.
"You two knuckleheads, you gotta promise me..."
You gotta take care of each other.
[exhales softly]
To Eddie Cruickshank.
Uncle Eddie.
Rest in peace.
[sighs]
"- Richard, say something."
- What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
"Something, anything."
He never got his Shangri-La.
"Son of a bitch would never admit it, but we had more in common than he knew."
"You know, from the moment he took us in, all I ever cared about was making sure he didn't regret it."
"Man, did I screw that up."
They sing the song too slow.
Slow?
"There are horses and a carriage, so they should sing it faster."
I'll handle it.
"It's a big problem, Daddy."
"I promise I'll handle this big problem, Goni."
Now can I have a good-night hug?
Daddy.
Get up.
What's wrong?
Your pills.
"Get up, do your exercises."
What did we say?
"10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the evening."
Well?
"Okay, okay."
Any messages for me?
"Someone called in the evening, but I said you were performing."
They didn't leave a message on your cell phone?
I didn't check.
It was a guy.
Goni.
You must have 5 minutes to sit with your father.
How many performances do you have this month?
"Three, four."
But I'm just an understudy.
I'm sure you're a better pianist than the one you substitute for.
How do you know?
I know.
Is it enough for the rent?
I put all your pills in the plastic box.
Goni.
Here comes Mrs Ellis and that Mrs Turner.
Here's your chance.
Try and sell them something extra.
Let's see a bit of salesmanship.
She's as bad.
She'd pass you on the street.
They're no good once they've been to Majorca.
Brown.
All she thinks about is being brown.
"And nearly everywhere, if you believe what he says next door."
"Well, who's got a better view?"
"20 Navy Cut, please."
"Same for me, Granville."
And a box of matches?
(HE MOUTHS)
Too much sun dries the skin.
It's very destructive.
-
- I go blotchy.
-
- She'll wish she'd kept more clothes on.
"And here, where me bra finishes, it always starts to peel."
It's further down where it gets me.
I can stand hardly any exposure round me navel.
Me skin goes all crisp.
Top of me thighs is where I get it.
"It's the ultra--violet, according to that friend of our Edmund."
He should know.
He's as big a violet as I've ever seen!
-
- How is your Edmund?
-
"Well, uh, just a minute."
"Dr. Alison, what's your off-the-cuff estimate"
- of Sally's condition?
"- Stay with her, Sergeant."
"Yes, sir."
"Here, Sally, let me help you."
This is Dr. Alison from the consulate.
"Without a complete diagnostic check-up, which we can only do properly at a medical office,"
I would say she is really a super chimp.
"Her heart has a steady beat, and she appears to be in astonishingly good health considering her fantastic voyage through space."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I want to get back"
- to my famous patient.
- Message received.
"I'll be needing you, Doctor."
Thanks.
"That's right, Nagoro."
We'll keep in touch.
Out.
That's it.
We're gonna lift her.
Put your hands under her.
- You get that end.
- Right.
Up we go.
"1, 2, 3, lift."
Here we go.
Now we'll turn.
(SERGEANT):
"You'll be all right, pal."
(CAPTAIN):
Here we go.
I'll get her from the front.
Check it out.
"So, uh, President Bush is in the news again."
Have you heard about this?
"No, Jay Leno."
The host of the Tonight Show.
I thought that's what I was doing.
"So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars."
You know?
"No, no."
Like Jay Leno.
"Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
"You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--"
"How is that different from what I was doing, though?"
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
Sure you will.
I just-- I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
"No, they said now."
"If they got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar."
"Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about."
"What about, uh, Ray Romano?"
Can you do Ray?
Hey.
"God, oh."
These might be the worst sounds ever made in this room.
It's not what it looks like.
"Yes, it is!"
This is exactly what it looks like.
Mason and I love each other.
"Nope, not buying it."
Mason's totally out of your league.
What are you guys talking about?
But you're going to tease me.
"No, we're adults."
I'm not going to tease you.
Okay.
[sighs]
I like Emma.
[mocking]:
Ooh!
So you like Emma.
"That's big, weird news."
"I would use it to my advantage, but you already do everything I ask without question."
"Well, it wasn't news to me."
I know everyone's secrets.
I was head bitch on my high school cheerleading squad.
"Huh, you know nothing about me."
Calf implants.
"I just, uh..."
looked at the brochure.
"Yes, Jack, I like Emma, but don't worry."
I have a foolproof plan to win her over.
"Unless it involves some kind of enchanted amulet,"
I find that hard to believe.
Boom!
Behold.
This is probably just a somewhat hilarious misunderstanding.
- Yes!
- This isn't what's important.
What's important right now is that we have to go to the old schoolhouse before it's too late.
"[ pigeon cooing ] Well, I can't really tell you how you got that rash if I don't have more information."
"It was about two weeks ago and my old college buddy was in town, and..."
Oh!
"OK, OK."
- I don't want to hear that.
- All right.
"So guys, we're going to tear this place down now, or what?"
Oh!
No!
Go back to the rash.
"You were saying, ""two weeks ago... ""?"
"Yeah, my old college buddy, hadn't seen him in a while..."
"- No demolition today, boys."
- But why?
This is the future site of the new Mercy mosque.
Yes!
"You totally saved the day, Ann!"
Mayors!
[ A cell phone rings. ]
Oh!
Oh!
"Hey there, hot stuff!"
Oh!
Hang on.
"Rayyan, Amaar just got arrested for having a bomb."
Ha!
Ha!
Very funny.
"- Hold it, don't move!"
- Stay down!
Breaking Bad
2x08
- Better call Saul
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
You are under arrest.
I'd better call Saul!
Hi.
I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, I know."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
What's she doing here?
I have no idea.
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
What is she doing?
Lately she just likes hanging out here.
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?
"Well, no, she's way too emotional."
"And by emotional, I mean crazy!"
That's just my Chinese food.
She has food delivered here?
"Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy."
I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
"Open the champagne, and I will be right back."
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking.
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
"-Rachel, wait."
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?
No.
"Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment."
"We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place."
"But, Mona, I live here."
Happy Valentine's Day!
"Or, something to remember me by."
-How long has it been this time?
they tried eminent domain then screwing with our water.
somebody poisoned our dogs.
those trucks...
Who knows.
Maybe.
look at 'em.
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains shucking their cloned-up super corn.
too.
Why do people eat it?
They don't.
They drink it.
Corn syrup.
It's in those drinks that everyone's having... whatever.
Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day.
Mine still are.
Those are for breakaway roping.
Those are for barrel racing and right here is for pole bending.
third place.
but my dad makes me.
Do you want to listen?
Do you like it?
you can take it for tonight and I'll get it back from you in the morning.
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.
Should hold it.
Yeah.
Till next time.
Thanks.
how long has your girl been like that?
Huh?
Mute.
since the beginning.
Mmm.
To write me an introduction or two.
You're not exactly inspiring me to send you away.
"What if I offered to stay here at the castle,"
"Even if I were married,"
At your beck and call?
You'd have diane.
"I'd have my station,"
My position.
Find me a rich noble
"Who treats me right,"
"And I'll treat you right, as well."
You've learned many skills at court.
Teach me more.
One suitor a week until I choose.
Agreed?
Agreed.
No.
No more.
I'm in charge now.
Have you found my mother?
"I need her now, more than ever."
They said she's with the king.
Trying to wring more out of henry
"Before I'm married to anyone, no doubt."
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?
No.
Francis?
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?
What an eventful day.
"Francis's return,"
Bosnia.
1995.
"The general-- remember, I told you about him?"
The warlord that you had to shoot.
You saved a lot of lives doing that.
I killed him...
"I, uh..."
I killed him right in front of his own son.
He's got allies and family.
This is about revenge.
"You-you can't know that, Booth."
It was just one X-ray.
"I mean, Aldo knew that I was the shooter."
He killed himself so he wouldn't have to give me up.
That's one possibility.
There are others.
"It's the only thing that makes sense, Bones."
"And whoever this is, they're not gonna stop until..."
What should we do?
Just be ready.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
"Previously on ""Somewhere Between""..."
"For one to live, one must die."
"Mommy's coming, angel."
I came back.
To eight days before.
Why am I the one under arrest?
She's the one who attacked me.
He's a trophy keeper.
All I'm asking for is the code to the lock on DeBray's apartment.
These could be trophies he took from the first five victims.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, what could possibly make you upset in a paradise like this, right?"
"He could find a way, trust me."
But stick around.
He shouldn't be that long.
"Besides, seeing you will make him feel better."
"Ah, well, I doubt that."
- You got that whole lease thing.
"- Right, right, right."
"Welcome, Kisan."
"I'm Charles Greane, assistant general manager."
- Great to have you.
- Indeed.
Appreciate it.
"What up, man?"
You ready to make us look good?
"Yeah, man, better than you already look."
- And you a handsome man.
- ( chuckles ) My dude.
"Hey, hey, hey."
You dandelions gonna run some drills or you gonna stand there circle jerking?
"Man, I was born to run, Coach."
You know that.
- My man make you say Bo looks slow.
- ( snaps fingers )
Why are we still talking?
You should be running.
Lace them the fuck up.
"Come on, I'll show you the locker room."
Let's go.
- Right.
- ( phone buzzing )
"I was shocked too, though."
We're very sorry.
Not at all.
No problem.
So why my computer?
There's this...
This what?
"Amazing stuff, ...you've got here!"
He's sucking up.
Dead right.
Top of the line.
Must be expensive?
"To buy, yes."
But I rent.
"Not including the special stuff, it's about a million a year."
A million!
I invented some stuff in high school.
"Royalties from that... and these games, ...bring in quite a lot."
Know this?
Did you make
The Last Legend?
Just the basic program.
That and Craps and Rappies...
Are they well-known?
Don't you know?
So what are you researching now?
Tempo-spatial applications of gravitational physics.
Or put simply...
Don't laugh.
A time machine.
There's already a way to leap to the future.
Liquid nitrogen.
"Wayne, Sherry was here when it happened, but she told me not to tell the police."
"Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly what happened over there, all right?"
We were talking with Alan.
"He got excited, then he started to gasp for air."
He gets angina.
"So you called 911, right?"
"No, no."
I-I tried to give him his medication.
What do you mean you tried?
Sherry stopped me.
"I went to help Alan, but she grabbed my arm."
I just stood there.
"I-I couldn't, I couldn't move."
I...
I...
"- I killed him, Wayne."
"- Shh, shh, shh."
"All right, listen to me carefully, all right?"
I killed him.
"Call Alan's lawyer, and do not say anything, anything to anyone until he gets there."
You understand me?
"Wayne, could you come down here and help me?"
"No, and please don't call me."
"I will help you, Julia, I will, but for right now I have to keep my distance, I'm sorry."
"Excuse me, coming through."
"- Let's move, right here."
"- Okay, swing it."
"Come on, come on, let's go!"
"One, two, three."
Carotid's been lacerated.
Start a twilight drip.
"Yes, doctor."
999.
We were expecting the mayor.
"You're just going to wait for an hour then ride a bus, then slepp on a subway..."
Schlep.
"""Schlep."" Not ""slepp."" ""Schlep."""
Get the gumbo out of your Yiddish.
How do you feel about the L.I.E.?
I hate the L.I.E.
Take the Grand Central.
Catch it at Astoria Boulevard.
"Go ahead, I'll show you."
Santos was a good cop.
You're doing a vile thing.
It's wrong to blame a dead cop and steal a widow's rights.
You keep saying that.
Nobody's doing anything.
You've got all the answers.
Don't even have the questions yet.
"Well, I got a question for you."
You hungry?
Swing by that diner up there.
The North Star.
Best Philly steak sandwiches in New York City.
Or do you call them Philadelphia steak sandwiches?
Who we going to meet here?
What are you talking about?
You surface in front of my car at the cemetery.
You show just enough leg so I'd stop.
And the Grand Central is the long way around.
Who we going to meet?
Albert Holly.
He was Eddie Santos' partner two years ago when Tino Zapatti got probation.
Jeremy won't be coming.
I cancelled him.
"Neil, it's just a night out, and we need to try new things."
"Yes, but you deserve a better escort than Jeremy."
You deserve the very best.
You were right.
We need to start over.
Like we're meeting for the very first time.
Get out.
Sorry?
I said get out.
"If this is a date, then you shouldn't be in my bedroom when I'm getting dressed."
"Oh, hello."
You must be Grace.
- And you must be?
- Neil.
Neil Truman.
"You're a little early, Neil Truman."
Come on in.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.
My husband and I bought it a long time ago.
You're married?
Does that shock you?
That a married woman would want to have sex with a stranger?
"Oh, I'm not here to judge."
Only to give you a night of pleasure that you'll never forget.
"Well, we better get started then."
Ahem.
Typically I receive the envelope before we begin the evening.
- The envelope?
Nothing is hidden in here.
And neither can one drink too much.
Sparkle as if you were in our house.
"Enough, what are you doing?"
What they all do.
"We are going, just relax."
-Let it all come out.
-Are you crazy.
"Enough, I feel so ashamed."
"No way, Francesca."
I know that you'll like it.
Can't you feel how wet you are?
"Let yourself go, Francesca."
This is an opportunity to play it for real.
Don't be afraid my love.
I am here.
Where are we going?
Get up Francesca.
Swap places.
We are going to another room.
But as in a mirror it all returned to be seen.
"Apparently... reserved and adaptable, but in reality the whoring of it all."
But seeing Paolo being possessed by another woman made me crazy with jealousy.
But this jealousy also made me cazy with lust and desire.
Yes Paolo!
I am enjoying it!
I like it!
"Me too, Francesca. me too!"
Yes my love
- I do too.
And it was so shameful.
-You were once?
Your answer?
Echidna?
"Echidna, show me your first letter."
Let's see if you're right.
"Yes, indeed, in the nick of time."
What is an echidna?
It sort of scuttles a bit.
It scuttles a bit?
!
It's a spiny anteater.
That's what I was going to say...
Of course you were!
Of course you were.
It's on the five cent coin.
It's a monotreme isn't it?
"It's a monotreme, an egg-laying mammal."
"Geniuses, I'm surrounded by geniuses."
"OK, where are we so far?"
"Araucarians, you're on one, welcome to the game."
"Lutrophiles, you're racing ahead at the moment with seven."
"You know what's going to happen now, it's going to get a bit harder."
"Because now I'm looking for two answers, and you must spot both to score the point."
"Lutrophiles, are you ready?"
Reveal the hive.
Picasso...
"Picasso's there, is Spain there?"
It might not be.
No.
I don't think it is.
It's not.
Brack?
No.
Now get ours.
That ship's not taking off without us.
You got that?
- Halt!
"- Oh, please don't shoot!"
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing
"- out here, lady?"
- I was being held captive.
By Nazis?
"No, worse."
- Your helmet.
- What about it?
I've seen it before.
"Paper, do you have paper?"
Something to write with.
"Lady, I think you're in shock."
Please!
Yeah.
"So if it wasn't Nazis, who were you running from?"
I need your helmet.
Now!
"I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet."
"Despite my wishes to pursue Savage alone, it seems that you're all intent on seeing this thing through till the bitter..."
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.
You knew.
You dropped us off five months later
- because you knew.
- Knew what?
"You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister."
- I'm afraid that that...
I guess I'll just...
I'll see you at work.
Yeah.
Is this the right decision?
Yeah.
Beth happy about it?
Yeah...
"I dunno, we'll see."
You don't exactly look happy.
Happy?
Happy comes later.
"Right now we're on a 30-day trial basis, kinda like a vacuum cleaner."
- How about the lieutenant?
- What about her?
- Is she OK?
"- What do you want me to say, Kay?"
You want me to say that Beth and I have come to a big understanding?
We haven't.
"Maybe we will, I dunno."
All I know is I gotta try.
"Allie's front tooth is falling out, I'm the tooth fairy, no one else, OK?"
"Zack slides into second base and breaks his collarbone,"
"I take him to the ER, no one else!"
"I remember what it was like when I broke my collarbone, and my dad wasn't there to take me to the hospital."
"The kids are kids, the rest of the people involved are adults, OK?"
All right.
"Just asking you how you are, that's all."
My car should be ready tomorrow.
Thanks... for the ride.
- Annabella?
- Yes.
- Tell me about the gloves.
"-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?"
"-Yes, I am."
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.
Did he talk to you about my party?
He sure did.
About my daughter?
"No, I didn't know you had one."
-He didn't mention her?
-No.
Oh.
Didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
"Priests are pretty tight-mouthed, then, huh?"
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
Sure.
"I mean, what if a person, uh, came to you you know, that was a murderer or criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
"I mean, would you have to turn him in?"
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
Mm-hm.
"And, uh, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If, um-"
"- If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 16th century.
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
What you need to do is focus on yourself.
Ok?
"So, please, sit."
No.
No?
"This is my therapy, and I should be allowed to decide what we talk about."
"Erica, just drop it."
Ok?
You're not his doctor.
This is not your problem.
"No, because his doctor is mia, and Kai is out there drowning, and you are acting like you don't even care."
You could talk to him.
No.
Yes.
You could get through to him.
You and I are not gonna discuss this any further.
"You know, unlike Dr. Fred,"
I don't become involved in the lives of other patients.
That's a rule?
That's my rule.
Fine.
We are not doing this today.
"Erica, come back."
Open the door.
"Come back and sit down in the chair, please."
Open the door!
Everything ok?
We had a disagreement.
"It wasn't our first, won't be our last."
"Well, disagreements are a normal part of the process."
This was different.
This felt like... the fights that I used to have with Sarah.
- You said this was gonna scare 'em.
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume.
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that would scare the pants off of you.
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes.
Stories to make your blood run cold.
- Yeah.
- Stories to terrify you.
Yeah.
"And whoever shall last through the night, shall be named the King of Halloween."
I accept.
We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wunderbar!"
Huzzah!
OK.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick-or-treaters.
Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
- Trick or treat.
I shall begin.
"Sorry, but don't mention that I was here."
You're fleeing?
Or your family will fall apart and you won't be a detective anymore.
They've been hiding for 15 years.
It's like being imprisoned.
"They've already atoned, let them go."
A crime is a crime.
What we did may be a crime to our families.
"Those are our civil affairs, not the police's problem."
"You're impossible, we're finished."
Wait...
But I'm a detective.
"Don't worry about me, I'm sure I'll be out in two years."
So wait for me.
"In two years, come pick me up at prison."
Open up!
We'll be okay.
What're you doing?
Hurry and open up!
Where's Suzuki San?
"Last I saw, she was delivering sushi."
Wasn't that a while ago?
"Room 405, right?"
I'll go check on her.
"Hello, front desk."
Mind coming up?
Is something wrong?
"Just come up, hurry."
"Alright Betty, time for a walk."
Like you're digging deep.
Sir?
You're becoming the earth...
# Now I'll run from you #
# This tainted love you've given #
# I give you all a girl could give you #
# Take my tears and that's not nearly #
# Oh... tainted love #
# Tainted love #
"# Don't touch me,please #"
# I cannot stand the way you tease #
"# I love you,though you hurt me so #"
# Now it's time you pack your things and go #
# Tainted love. #
"The guy sings a five-minute song about what I bitch I am, and then kisses me and walks away."
I should not be turned on right now.
I can't believe he walked away.
"I mean,who does that?"
"And what,has he been locked away at T Hot Rocker Academy of Kissing for the past five years?"
"Hey,Bella."
What?
Where's my car?
Hello!
"Obvious sign,girl."
What the hell?
- You were driving.
- Exactly.
I was busy.
"Dude,I'm gonna blame you."
It's my option.
Are you serious?
"I'm not paying this time,just so you know..."
"Hi,Marty."
"Um,so,my sister is an ass."
"And,uh,we're gonna need a ride."
Careful.
Don't worry;
I know my cousin's greed all to well.
He won't let that land slip away.
Fourteen thousand and three shekels!
Eighteen thousand shekels!
you can't afford it.
but he doesn't. want to see how you get yourself out of it.
Eighteen thousand shekels going once!
eighteen thousand shekels going twice!
And eighteen thousand going...
Eighteen thousand and one!
Boaz?
your charity has no end.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
I'll bear any burden.
Your worries will be my own.
I've been blessed by your care.
for you are my home.
and stone only make a dwelling.
It's you that makes this house a home.
I'll follow.
I'll never leave you alone.
given love like no other.
Now you are my home.
Heaven smiles on us both;
for you are my home. ( end song)
Good morning.
You're up early.
What about you?
Me?
I was alone...
Until now.
Openly flirting?
Have you never seen a pretty girl in your life?
"No, I was waiting for you."
Do you do anything else other than charm people?
Juggling.
"- Hey, we have just met, okay?"
- Okay.
Slow down.
Spend some time with me and you will find out everything.
"Oh, mystery."
You guys think that if you speak less..
..hide a few things then the girl will stay interested.
Your smile itself is mysterious.
If you can spare a moment from looking at me..
..then let me know what you'll drink.
Whatever you want.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do it?
"You got jealous, right?"
I mean... you are drinking alone to drown your sorrows.
You could have joined me.
Stupid girl.
That isn't my drink.
And I am not alone.
Who told you that?
- So who's with you?
- I've found someone.
- Who?
It was her evening gown Gina didn't want the messenger to see.
"And, in the normal course of events,"
Danny would have been suspected of the murder.
But things are never normal when little--
"Hey, look at the new dress."
Della picked it out.
"Oh, I did not."
Isn't she pretty?
Sure is.
How about a date?
"Merle, I think you owe these people a very, very large encomium."
"What for, Julian?"
Well-- thanks.
For saving your life.
"Oh, I was going to give them all a big kiss for that, silly."
"Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc."
"Burbank, CA"
"Now, you may not be the man I want, but don't make me kill you."
Turn around slow.
You John Tyree?
I am.
You and this country have already cost me a good horse.
Which one?
"You got your mind set on it, we'd better find out."
"One more thing, though."
I didn't kill the marshal.
Know that!
I didn't kill him.
I won't try to prove it.
Only the man in Texas.
"All right, where?"
"Nora, Johnny, you need anything..."
"Gary, Gary, get a plate."
You just dropped mustard on my half-dead ex-husband.
How you holding up?
"Surreal, man."
"All the patients we brought here, it's never personal."
This is...
I don't know.
"Hey, Mac said you can take the day off tomorrow."
Take as much time as you need.
"Oh, no."
I'm working.
"I sit here all day, I'll go crazy."
I came as soon as I could.
- What'd the doctor say?
- Could go either way.
"All right, so we got options."
"Okay, everybody, I'm selling squares 10 bucks a pop."
We're also doing pool bets...
Over/under's at three days.
- Mom...
- Over/under for what?
If he lives?
Either way pays.
I thought Johnny's parents were divorced.
They are.
There's no way an Irish woman would miss a good death.
Mom and Dad have a complicated relationship.
It's not complicated.
I hate him.
"But if my coma bets pay off, I'll love him."
"Frank, whatever you're gonna do, do it on Wednesday."
I don't see anything that I would consider to be art.
But you took the picture.
Just because ducky told me to.
- I'm sorry.
- That'okay.
I'm sure you find other things beautiful.
Like gibbs breaking up a chick fight.
I can't believe I missed that.
"Well,I've got good news."
Guess at is now playing on mcgee tv.
I hug and kiss technology.
You liar!
mee-yow.
Which one's siri?
The one that gibbs is pulling off e other girl.
It's always good to have a face to put with genetic material.
You get a match on h off finn's clothing?
Yeah.
But not just her.
There was a party in finn's pants.
I found genetic material from two distinct females.
- Siri and...
- A mystery woman.
That would explain why rebecca refused thcheek swab.
Told us she hadn't seen him in six months.
Play iagain.
"Plus,rebecca's got a lot of anger in her."
"Oh,I wouldn't assume siri is innocent."
Why not?
Look at the fight.
Siri initiates it.
She may not be as sweet as she looks.
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
"She may know much, if properly motivated."
"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We've hit stone!
Clear it off.
"Come on, find the edges."
"Good, good, good."
"You see, Indy?"
You see?
"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
"As a team, boys!"
As a team!
Push!
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.
"Good, good, that's it."
Watch your toes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"Sorry, Indy."
Indy... why does the floor move?
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
"Two in the neck, four in the back."
Or was stabbed three times.
Look at the pattern.
"Two, two, and two."
Three times...
With a pair of scissors.
"Yes, that's possible."
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
"- Spur of the moment, not planned."
- Plus...
The mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would've seen that."
So she was running when she left the building.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
"I guess you can say that there were 12 million people with a motive, myself included."
This was the Lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What's what?
On her fingertips.
Thank you.
Do you remember the day my grandmother died?
Jenna?
Remember how they let me in so that I could kiss her goodbye?
"There was this pain in my heart that day that I had never felt before,"
and that I've never felt again until now.
I feel like I'm mourning the death of the single most important thing in my life.
Us.
"But we're not dead, Jenna."
"We're not dead, baby."
We just have to go back.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.
Please love me enough to let us go back to the way things were.
"I don't think I can, Michael."
"Well, then, we'll start something new, but we have to try, right?"
How can we not try?
Jenna?
Jenna?
Western grip?
Western grip?
Correct.
Just like holding hands.
Holding hands?
Like this?
- I don't know how.
- I don't know how.
Yamete kudasai.
Ah?
Please stop doing that.
- Can't hear you.
He wanted me to come up there with him.
You didn't go.
- You did the right thing.
"- No, I didn't."
He had no business there without a ghost.
"That should have been me, plus backups."
But Eddie was such a hothead...
I mean the kind that never cools off.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
"This one it set Tino up for the max, 10 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer...
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State Parole Officer.
Better pay and pension.
- Nicer surroundings.
- Think so?
It's not what you think.
"Amira, you are planning an attack at school."
Please!
"Please, Drew."
Let me at least try to explain.
After we broke up...
I was lonely.
"I went online, started talking to this guy from back home."
"A friend, but he didn't like this country."
I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear - just to keep talking to someone.
But it wasn't real.
"Not for me, Drew."
Never for me.
None of it?
No.
"Please, Drew, you know me."
And you told all of this to Mr. Harris?
Yes.
"And I showed him all the texts from Kasym,"
Where I am telling never to contact me again.
What he was talking about was crazy.
So what is Mr. Harris going to do?
"He say he'll tell the principal that he believes me, then we see what happens from there."
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I know you only did this because you care for me.
And it's made me realize that I feel the same way.
Can we talk later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
"I told him I was texting with someone from Chechnya,"
The kind he always gets from the office.
Okay.
"I'll be right back, okay?"
Why is the door locked?
Sorry.
Reflex.
Hey.
That was the man who shot Haskell.
- Who was?
- The messenger who was just here.
- What'd he bring you?
"- You're joking, right?"
No.
It was him.
That was his helmet and his jacket.
"I'm sorry, I'm not following."
Ils there a reason an assassin would be delivering packages to me at home?
"He was here, so you tell me."
"III will take this as some kind of a reaction to the trauma of what you saw, and I will ask you..."
Did you see the man's face at the shooting?
No.
- Did you see it today?
"- No, he was wearing a helmet."
Was there something distinctive about that helmet or that jacket which tells you it was the same man?
No.
There wasn't.
"Okay, then."
Do you feel better?
Yeah.
"So, what was the delivery?"
"From the office, some files."
Why?
Kaya gave me a voice message to translate to you.
It's in this thumb drive.
"I'm going to begin, ok?"
Are you mixed?
Hi Gym.
I'm sorry about keeping my interview at the factory a secret.
I love you
But we hardly have anything in common.
"For example, our interests culture attitude religion and how to live life."
I think we won't make it together.
We can't really communicate and understand each other.
Communicate my ass!
We slept together every night!
Umm I don't know.
I'm here just to translate.
"I'm going to continue, ok?"
I hope you will meet the right person one day.
You are right for me.
I don't want to listen anymore!
Ok.
That's fine.
If you don't want to listen anymore.
Wait.
You're the one who taught her English?
Yes
This is your fault!
Damn it!
What the hell are you looking at?
Is that a bomb?
"Excuse me, what is that?"
Chicken soup I think.
Chicken soup?
"Since I have a private number, Hallie won't pick up."
Neither will any of our friends in case it's you know someone annoying.
They will... call you back.
"But since we all have private numbers, it's nearly impossible for us to communicate by phone."
"Fortunately, I pick up my phone."
"Otherwise, this game of trading voicemails would never end."
Hello.
"Hey, it's Hallie."
Hey.
Jerk off!
This guy is on his cell phone and can't drive.
Sorry.
Hey... are you ok?
Yeah.
I'm ok.
How are you?
"Hey, um, you want to meet up for dinner tonight and maybe just... clear the air about everything?"
Yeah.
I think we should.
How does 8pm at Cascade sound?
All right.
Sounds good.
Great.
I'll meet you there.
Oh...
You didn't think I'd forget... did you?
"Wow, they're beautiful."
Thank you.
So what are the big plans for tonight?
"Well, that was um, Hallie."
"She wants to uh, get together and so we can talk about everything."
I think she forgot it was my birthday though.
[Horn blows]
[Horn blows]
2 of diamonds.
2 no trumps.
3 spades.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
"3 spades it is, then."
"Ahh, I can't help you much, I'm afraid."
"Ahh, for God's sake."
How much longer can they keep us here?
"Till after tea, anyway."
"Arthur, you think you should be working after everything that's happened?"
"No, no."
I have to keep busy.
"Yes, of course."
You and I have business to discuss about your late wife's affairs.
What?
Seems we're going to be in partnership.
"That's not-- when the Germans arrive, the high command, we'll be able to put them up here at the hotel."
We're near enough to the coast.
They won't arrive.
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
You do know that the Belgians have capitulated?
Yes.
Last number to call and last number dialled.
- How was she?
- What does that mean?
- Did she seem suspicious or anything?
- All right.
A bit trusting.
I wouldn't let anybody into my house like that.
- That's cos you're a hard-faced bitch.
- Sorry!
"Well, you steal credit cards from vulnerable women."
- Just a moment of madness?
- No.
I fell for a cheap whore in a bar.
"Well, it had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
I'd advise you two to get a room but you already have.
"Shut up, Calum."
"Now, sit nice and try not to lick the windows."
"Hello, is that the Longbay Hotel?"
"Could you put me through to lain Risdale, please."
- Yeah.
That's him.
"- John, check the words to this."
Yo!
And I ain't chatting no black talk.
"- ""Yo"" means ""I"" in Spanish."
- Very impressive.
"There's more. ""Yo no soy marinero. "" ""I ain't no sailor. """
"""Soy Capitan. "" ""I'm Captain. """
- I've found Risdale.
"- To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
He's got ideas - big ones.
"Isn't that right, Prof?"
"Damn right, Rambo."
I see.
"In two days, you'll be begging me to come back."
Yeah?
"In two days, you'll be begging us for change!"
On the streets!
"Yes, Prof!"
Rinser!
"Right, let's go jugball."
Everyone has to watch.
"Now, that's a good chair."
Me tooth's all hurty.
It's one of my best ones and all.
Maybe it's a wisdom tooth.
Unlikely Grumio'd have any of them.
Why are you dressed like an adult?
"Because I'm a big cheese, now, baby, and don't you forget it."
"Don't you forget to lower the price of grain, then."
"Yes, yes, on my list."
Below fixing the loos but above the squeaky door.
You - we've gots to go.
Hoots!
"Good morning, everyone."
My name is Marcus Gallo.
I'm the new Head of HR.
"Under my watch, this company is going to look after everyone - from the brainy boffins in Accounts, all the way down to Lena the cleaner, starting today."
"Also starting today, guys, there's a big jugball tournament here on the jugball court."
Please come and watch Stylax and his team-mate take on me and Urbo.
Where'd you get him from?
"He works in Finance, I think."
You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened on.
"You were the door to another life, where my seed might have been affirmed."
Ta-da!
I found your shoe!
"I""ve brought back to this hole a breath of life, which I am trying to use."

"Are you coming out, ese?"
Staying in.
"Are you sure you know what you're doing, ese?"
SimÃ²n.
You scared me by showing me a glimpse of what my life might have been.
That's Lourdes.
"Ã""rale."
"Hey, be careful!"
"Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash."
Check that one out.
See all the people?
They were throwing rice and shit.
Look at Mama.
Pull over up here.
I gotta take a leak.
"This medal I send to you as a gift for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use."
St. Dismas is the patron saint of all those in prison.
He has protected me.
You'll be OK.

[Woman] Washed up from a shipwreck.
"Oh, the poor thing."
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
- [Woman hums] - [Gasps]
I'll just...
I'll just get this washed for you.
"[Gasps, splutters]"
"Well, you must have at least heard about this girl."
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
[Burps]
- Really.
"- Madam, please..."
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
"If Eric's looking for a girl,"
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
[Gasps]
[Knife glistens]
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
"Oh, Eric, be reasonable."
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...
"I'm tellin' ya, Grim."
She was real.
"I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her."
"[Woman laughs] Come on, honey."
Don't be shy.
"Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?"
"Uh, you look wonderful."
She made me realize
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I know that now.
I'm three months pregnant and you're already out trying to fuck other women!
What's gonna happen 10 years from now?
How could I ever trust anything you say again?
Jenna.
"Fuck you, man."
It's over.
- Jenna.
- Get out right now.
I'll tell you when you can come back and get your shit.
Maybe Kimmy can help you pack.
"- Jenna, we're having a baby."
- No.
"No, I am the one having this baby."
"I'm the pregnant one, not you."
And she's better off with no father than a lying asshole like you!
You're overreacting.
It was a couple kisses.
"After three years, Jenna, things happen."
"- Not to me, they don't!"
Get out!
- And go where?
Get out of here!
Go back to fucking Kim!
"What, are you gonna fucking stab me, Jenna?"
- Get out!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out!
So why exactly are we going to his birthday party then?
I don't know.
"Free booze, good times, the usual?"
His parents supposed to have a fuck-off pad.
"Yeah, it's huge."
Proper country house.
Old man's a judge.
Kind of hoping she's gonna be there.

Good boy.
We're S.E.A.L.S.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
"If you had taught him how to load that thing, there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge."
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We'd all be dead...
Five minutes.
"Shooters, you're gonna get a magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds."
A magazine of 5 rounds and a magazine of 20 rounds.
All ready on the firing line!
All ready on the firing line!
"Shooters, make ready!"
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Unload!
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."

No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I won't disappoint you.
I'm sorry.
"Please, doctor."
"Your medication, miss Porter."
"Thank you, Gunther."
"What book are you reading, miss?"
"Uh, it's Edgar Allan poe."
Why would a lady like yourself fancy such grim materials?
"The tales may be dark, i know what you're saying, but through them he asks questions of humanity in situations most extreme."
"In plumbing these depths, he holds up a mirror to our own lives."
You're a very thoughtful woman.
"Thank you, Gunther."
"If you ever need anything ever, you just let me know."
Isabel.
"Oh, Dr. Jacobs."
Calm yourself.
"Oh, thank god."
There's a man in there.
There's blood everywhere.
I...
I just...
Dr. lemelle.
Our surgeon.
What are you doing out of your room this time of night?
"I heard a noise, so I came to see what..."
Came to see what evil lurks in these halls at night?
No.
They're... small fry... tiddlers.
Their father was in the Resistance.
Dirty little habits...
The tiddler says...
"Good evening, Miss."
"Fire and brimstone at Mr. Venom's, huh?"
You made a good move.
I'm making another:
Your engagement present.
- Good behavior:
"Seven years, minus ten days."
"- Shit, how could I know?"
They haul me out of the clink only to say that you're shitting in Venom's boots.
It's not '45 or '68 any more.
"In '45, you were king of the streets."
What a result.
- The streets are still around.
- So am I. But the posters have changed.
"Well, I'm not dumb enough to get my head on a poster!"
But dumb enough to have your father clean up after you.
Your stepbrother is right.
"To survive, it's better to forget."
"So they got you banged up, guaranteed you a soldier's pension, is that it?"
"What I did, I did in memory of you."
And for her.
"That's one too many, Mickey."
"To survive, you've got to forget!"
I did it for you.
"Here, have your beloved son!"
Your favorite!
I love you!
Mary!
Put it into third!
Watch what you're doing!
"Brake, brake!"
The middle pedal!
Goubi's piece of soil.
"Over there, I see a large room with tiled floors."
The kitchen here.
"There, the laundry."
And our bedroom up there.
Then there's...
There's something else.
What's that?
Well now...
"As far as looking after the animals ...bringing in fodder, cutting timber is concerned I think that because you'd have ME, you're doing the right thing."
But as for the other things...
For the other things...
You can leave it to me.

"What are these, bitch cuffs?"
- Hold still.
"- My hand, man!"
I said hold still!
Cadillac Kligman.
Six Million Dollar Man.
Six pins in his leg and a bunch of screws loosing his head.
And I was hoping for a slow day.
I'll get started on the paperwork.
Better get him out of here.
Have fun.
What the hell are you doing?
That's my desk!
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Now I'm feeling good.
"It's nerve-racking being here now though, and actually seeing, Iike where you're actually playing."
"Like, I sat here the other week watching Kanye West play."
And now we're here.
I just feel a bit nervous.
"AII right, fellas, Iet's start."
So first day of rehearsals.
They've done the same choreography the Iast two years.
Now I'm changing it.
"Heads, will!"
should we start?
"Louis, you're on that X."
was never really a fan of boy bands before One Direction.
I'm a massive boy band fan myself.
"Backstreet Boys, NSYNC."
"When people say, ""You're in a boy band""  I'm like, ""Yeah, I am, but I'm in a cool boy band."""
"So I'm like, ""Okay, whatevs."""
Right from the start we were always very v ocal  that we couldn't follow the boy band stereotypes.
"Choreographed dance routines, and everything's the same."
Here we go!
"Go, NiaII!"
Taking the crowd with you!
Love the stag.
Keep the stag.
"really good, Iike that."
Keep that in.
"paul, our choreographer gets bored, I think."
"NiaII, up that ramp."
"Harry, come on!"
It's a free-for-aII.
That chip allows you to see the future.
"Yeah, I can see the attraction."
"You have to tell me what's going on, Artie."
"Well, he may have figured it out already."
Seriously?
"I mean, it's Pete we're talking about."
I can't get ahold of him.
His cell keeps going to voice mail.
- Alice has obviously the Farnsworth.
- Dude...
He's in a big hotel.
There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno.
He said that this chip saved his life.
- And you stole it?
- It's what we do.
"Pete Lattimer, white courtesy telephone."
"Jillian, take the money and run, don't walk."
Find a beach.
Never look back.
I am gonna go get your husband.
"Wait, hold on."
You're not arresting us?
You're letting us go?
"What happens in Vegas, okay?"
Just get outta here.
It looks like you were telling the truth.
Don't hurt Jillian.
Do you know what?
Hurting is half the fun.
You wanna know what's more fun?
The other half.
Who are you?
"Sinaté, I'm preparing a little trip."
"Hey, you, what about your papers?"
I don't have any.
"Hey, get up!"
Come on!
"You, there!"
Get up!
Your ID?
"The guy asked him for a ""hit""."
"As the baker didn't understand, the Sarakollé showed him a loaf of bread..."
Then the baker and his wife started to laugh.
That's funny!
"Our Sarakollé fathers... in Europe, make fun of white people..."
Really funny!
Leave that!
What have I done now?
You're provoking me!
"Come on, M'Batoma, let's go to the room."
Founé!
See the children off to bed!
Is this your little girl?
Time to go to bed.
"Excuse me, Balla... it's better to be alone."
Women are indiscreet.
- What do you do?
- Nothing.
"After returning from Europe, my husband won't let me work."
What about your degrees?
Young men are jealous.
In a week you'll have your car.
I'll go and see Bathily for your coverage.
You'll have all the privileges of your rank.
"But let me tell you something, I know you love this car."
You love this car so much that you come in two days a week.
Two days a week to just look at it and then you walk out.
"Gerald, life's too short, man."
Life is too short.
Okay?
Things change in an instant.
Take it from me.
Okay.
So be a man.
Take control of your life.
Be a man.
Buy this car.
Show all these people that they're wrong.
That you can make a decision.
I'm gonna really think about it.
No.
"No more thinking, Gerald."
No more thinking.
No more dithering.
"No more wasting everybody's time, especially your own."
'Cause that's what you're doing.
You're wasting your time every time you come in here.
Buy this car because you love it and because you want this car and you want to drive off this lot in this car today.
Buy it.
Okay.
Okay.
Mr. Garrity!
"Yes, sir."
"All right, Gerald over here would like to go ahead and start paperwork on purchasing this hybrid here."
"Yes, I would."
"Congratulations, Gerald."
Really likes improv.
- Anyway.
- One summer mommy had to work for ones.
OK.
"Well, look, I basically, since I got Trent back to"
"Tampa, he agreed to give me this."
Oh.
"Hey, what's that junky old piece of crap?"
- My grandma's wedding ring.
- It's so pretty!
- Thank you so much for doing that for me.
- I didn't just do it for you.
I did it for my best friend.
Did you just call me your best friend?
"- Yes, I did."
- I don't think I want that anymore.
You need to try that.
"Look, I already know you're my best friend even though that pissed me off quite a bit."
But I need to know if you'd be willing to be my best man.
Hey.
Of course.
Baby bird.
"Let's get married, huh?"
"Well, summer, fall but definitely not this season."
"Hey, buddy."
***
"Oh my god, you're so annoying!"
"OK, Shelly, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to my face right after?"
"Oh, no, sweetie..."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
There's still some ladies in Detroit who think they slept with a chunky-eyed Isaiah Thomas.
"Maybe we could find out who it is, at least."
"You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something."
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
Guess which ones.
No.
"So, there was only one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
I knew him.
How did he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
That's where...
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death.
Exactly.
"So, what?"
This ghost is possessing nerds?
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.
"- Thanks, Sam."
- Great school.
I don't care.
"Three years, and I'm out of here."
I'm going to Michigan State.
They got the best vet program in the country.
You like animals?
They're a lot nicer than people.
"So tonight I'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter."
"Mm, kinky."
Is he telling the truth?
Is Tucker not my son?
"You gotta believe me, I never meant to hurt you."
What is that supposed to mean?
Why did you lie to me?
(struggling)
I'm so sorry.
Melody!
"Look, put him in interrogation until NOPD comes."
Let him go.
Do what?
"Look, I said just let him go, damn it."
I probably would have done the same thing if I were him.
Lasalle...
"Look, just do it!"
Stay the hell away from my kid.
Get out of here before I change my mind.
PRIDE:
You believe him?
I don't know what to believe.
"Melody did seem pretty clear about it, though."
"I mean, she kept saying she was sorry."
"I mean, how could she do it, King?"
Bring a little boy into my life and tell me I'm his father...
when I'm not?
"I don't know, Chris."
Something you gotta ask her.
"Well, it won't change anything, so what's the point?"
"The point is, you deserve to know."
"It doesn't matter, all right, it is what it is."
Christopher.
It's not something you can pretend didn't happen.
On the contrary.
Come with me.
We will take the air in the garden.
I'm taking care of her.
We woke up painful memories to you.
You are very alone in this house.
Don't you have relatives?
No.
Friends?
"I'm here, now."
I am very careful.
Attentive to your eyes.
My eyes?
"Yes, they are so young, so clear."
"And yet, I guess all they have seen recently that they should not have seen."
Smile at me.
I am convinced you will soon find your brother.
Believe me.
"What can I say, Sir?"
Your words are helping me in an unexpected way.
Probably you already suffered greatly in your own flesh.
The suffering of others can not but interest a man like me.
Your dedication affects me greatly.
"It is limitless, know it."
"Nanteuil, we will take our leave."
"Don't bother to lead us out, Miss."
We'll let you know soon.
"Goodbye, sir."
Goodbye.
Count on me.
And good luck.
He is ...well...
- You gotta talk to me.
- What does Dr. Beckett say?
- He says I'm hilarious.
"Thursdays at 4, highlight of his week."
He should be paying me.
"- Okay, I..."
- I...
Just please.
"Please, just..."
I didn't know that he had stopped coming to see you.
"I'm really scared, and I'm really confused because Eddie has so much going for him."
- He's so loved.
"- Julia, depression is not circumstantial."
It's got nothing to do with what you did or you didn't do.
Eddie is not choosing to feel this way.
I know.
I know.
And she could reach around a wall and smack you in the head before you...
And the arm would...
All you'd hear is this:
Ernest Hemingway blew his head off with a shotgun.
"Click, bang."
Thank you.
Can we get the check?
"His wife, Mary, said he was simply cleaning the gun."
And I think that's some housekeeping gone awry.
"Hey, how are you?"
- Haven't seen you here in a while.
- Yeah.
"Had he hung himself, would it have been that he was just cleaning the rope?"
- How's he doing?
- Fine.
- There was a shipwreck.
And the captain thought he saw the ghosts.
Le Bosco was also acting strangely
- And at dawn
- What happened at dawn?
They were in the marshes near the haunted ruins at dawn.
And now -
There they are.
How do you know all of this?
I just know.
What if they're still alive?
"For God's sake, shut up"
The captain has shut himself in his house.
He's afraid.
You're all crazy!
You know what's hidden away in the ruins.
If they made it there
Two girls.
Wounded and exhausted!
I think they must have drowned!
I hope so
If they are hiding in the ruins and they free
Don't mention his name!
We don't really know what's hiding in the ruins.
Yeah.
But if they manage to get that far... what will happen?
All I know is that no one has been there for at least a century.
Shut up!
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Do you understand?
- Help!
Stop it!
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
So I'll come back next week?
Excellent.
My pleasure.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.
Dr. Roncero's office.
"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephantsized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
You're right.
Did you read about the nuns?
The ones who were raped by missionaries in Africa.
The priests themselves!
It's horrible!
"If you can't trust a missionary, what's to become of us?"
- They used to rape the local women.
- Really?
"Because of AIDS, they started raping the nuns."
"Oh, my God!"
And I had the missionaries on a pedestal.
I'm sure not all of them are rapists.
- I hope not.
"- No, some are pedophiles."
- What's that?
- Everybody loves fucking...
"Shut up, Antonio."
You're such a brute.
- How do the bulls look?
"- Good, but heavy."
- What do you reckon?
"- Over 1,000 lbs."
Holy shit!
I'm going to our bar.
"Lydia, remember we're eating at home."
"If the kids don't see their aunt, there'll be hell to pay."
Good luck.
Bull's coming.
"Don't cry, love."
Hello.
How is she?
"Poor thing, very bad."
And no sor of music would tempt you out?
Not at all.
Not even if it was Tiger Feet by Mud?
"Well, that would tempt me out, yes."
Or Fox On The Run by Sweet or anything from the '60s or 'the 70s.
"Pretty much anything I'll go and dance to, actually."
I hate being in the kitchen at parties.
I'm no good at it.
Do any of you have party tricks that you do?
Any little things that you can sort of just...?
"Yes, yes, Rhys?"
Take that.
Listen to this.
"Two, two, testing."
"That's not it, is it?"
What I'll do is I'll do...
"For the festive season, I'll do the sound effects of Santa arriving at the top of the house and then coming down the chimney to put the presents under the tree."
Here he comes.
"Santa arriving, folks."
MAKES FAST GALLOPING SOUND
MAKES THUMPING SOUNDS
Ohh!
Aagh!
COUGHS
Ho ho ho!
APPLAUSE Very good.
That was...
That was special.
So we're heading to a new year.
What does it hold for my guests tonight?
"Rhys, where will you be?"
Which hemisphere will you be in?
Doesn't chemistry mean anything?
"Try to understand, please."
- Relax!
- I'll kill her.
Move...
Move...
Stay there.
I swear I'm going to kill her.
"What have you done, Shiv?"
He will kill you.
"Wait, did you kidnap me or did I kidnap you?"
I don't understand.
- Oh my!
- What happened?
Uncle and auntie.
- What?
"- Hello, uncle."
"I seek your blessings, aunty."
How are you doing?
Did you see what she was about to do?
"Ultimately, I had to explain it to her that she cannot marry him."
"And auntie, after using my body, how could she..."
"Don't be stupid, Shiv."
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
"Just a second, aunty."
You didn't jump into the pool but you jumped into the sea!
You know you are the first heroine..
..to go and plank herself in the villain's den?
And I am looking for you like a hero turned monkey...
And that b**tard is coming after my tail with a match in his hand.
Shiv...
"Just-just give a good look at the dog, will ya?"
- Just give him one good look.
-I don't wanna look.
"A good look or a bad look,"
I'm taking him back to the pound!
- Now get out of my way.
-Come on.
"Just-just give him a look, will you, Ralph?"
You know what?
"I know why you're afraid to give him a look-- you're afraid that if you look into these brown, soulful, trusting eyes, that it'll do something to your heart."
Just look.
"Look into those eyes, Ralph."
"Look, look, look."
"Put him back in the box, Norton!"
-(pleading indistinctly)
-Put him back in the box or I'm gonna do something to you!
Get out of the way!
Open that door.
Open the door.
"Ralph Kramden, you've just lost your membership card to the human race."
I still say it's the best appetizer I ever tasted!
"- Pardon me, sir."
"-Yes, sir?"
I'd like to return a dog that my wife got here yesterday.
Let me see now.
It's a good dog.
"You, uh, say your wife picked him up here yesterday?"
- Yeah.
-What's your name?
Kramden.
K-R-A-M-D-E-N.
- I'll have to check the record first. -'Kay.
It's their atlas.
Do sit down.
"We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy."
We're sorry to have to leave you all.
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.
He has his own barouche.
- You have two brothers?
- Yes.
Edward is the elder.
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...
This is your home now.
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?
One can presume she wants to count it.
What are you doing?
Gifts for the servants.
Where is Margaret?
She's taken to hiding.
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.
I have.
I've said yes and no.
"Good morning, Fanny."
"Good morning, Miss Marianne."
How did you find the silver?
- Can we take that as a yes?
- No.
Everything eventually registers.
He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.
- Days?
- Days.
"Hey, is Jackson in the house?"
Let me hear you say...
- A new toy.
- Shameless.
- How's it going?
- I hate these books.
Hate them.
No.
See that?
They're trying to escape.
"They hate me, too."
Your books don't hate you.
"Rory, my brain is full."
It has reached capacity.
It's Shea Stadium when the Beatles played.
"It's cramped, girls are screaming, and George is fighting with Ringo."
- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.
"Close your eyes, clear your head."
Clearing my head just means that... all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out.
"In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff."
It's a very vicious circle.
I'll make some coffee.
- I hate finals.
That's the reason why they hate me.
Petreius:
Why do you stay with me?
Why don't you simply leave me to my solitude?
"Because I love you, like my own son."
You love me?
Like your son?
"I love you, too!"
Where are you?
I can live with the election of Claudius Tiberius but he must restore all our privileges.
Don't worry.
Claudius will do anything we want.
But we still didn't solve one problem:...
Who is going to kill Caligula?
And how will it happen?
I'll take care of this problem.
I know who is going to kill Caligula.
Who will kill that monster!
Checkmate.
What news of marathon?
Will Greece be saved?
The Persian sun will pass.
my brave heart.
"Stop it, Daddy, stop it."
"Hey, Dad, come on upstairs and we can play my new electronic game I bought."
"Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy."
"Oh, come on."
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
"- Well, I just don't."
mom could play with us.
I meant the exhibition.
Very successful.

And your artist?

Likewise.

So why didn't you stay?
* Grows around the blooming heather *
Would have covered for you.

"I was thinking about...what Mr.Hilliard said about, needing to backseat for death speech."
I am.
* I will build my love a tower * * From the pure and crystal mountain *
* And around I should... * * All the flowers of the mountain *

Someone would be copyin' it.
So...
"You know, now a couple of days in Devon."
London for the studio shoot.
Huh...then what?
Back to careless talk and carrots.
Don't know.
"Swain's takin' about another feature. ""Air Raid Wardens""."
There'll be slob.
I don't know.
Here.
Tell you this.
Marry you.
I can't believe it.
-She--
-You don't think a psychiatrist...?
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"-Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
-Yeah.
So in the meantime try not to worry.
How?
"The edema affected her brain, you understand?"
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio."
-You should've called me when it happened.
-Listen.
Regular hospital not gonna put up with that.
"We give her a shot and bring her here until the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her right out."
"Two or three months and she's out, good as new."
-Miss?
-Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.
-Are you a relative?
"-Yes, I am her brother."
He is her son.
Just a minute.
"You know, it's funny."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of there."
"You go in, Dimmy."
I'll wait for you outside.
To say that...
I love you   and that I don't want you to die and lots of other things...
Come over here.
I love you.
Shouldn't you hurry up?
They'll be here soon.
You look great.
Thank you.
"There, come on."
- Are you still up?
- It's skateboarding.
Is it skateboarding?
Is it exciting?
- Move!
- It's really exciting.
Move!
Then you have to go to bed in half an hour.
Sleep tight.
"Jorgen was a diplomat, so he was sent down there."
He sat down in the chair and he didn't say a word.
"Finally Baunsgaard asks, will they do it by 3   or will we have to pay overtime?"
"Jorgen said, you won't have to pay overtime at least."
I just fired all 42 of them.
This story gets better and better.
Last time it was 32.
"I don't know the cost in dollars and cents, but we almost went bankrupt."
But we had integrity.
"Integrity, Jorgen."
"- And cheers to that, Jorgen."
- Thanks.
Cheers.
- You're not drinking much tonight.
Love you too.
Bye.
Georgie?
What's gonna happen at the appointment tomorrow?
It'll be fine.
I called Clint and I left a message.
He knows us and he loves you.
Just be totally honest and nothing bad can happen.
"That hasn't always worked, even with Clint."
Look.
I know that you were disappointed when we asked your aunt Crystal to leave.
And I know that you wish things could've turned out differently.
No.
I don't.
Not anymore.
And I-I was just on the phone with Jeffie and he remembers Crystal.
My mom...
She didn't trust her and... she said she was a bad influence on us.
Come here.
"Everything's gonna be all right, okay?"
"Amy, honey, I thought you did a great job at that meeting today."
"Well, at least it was a step."
"Now that I can get close to Matt's horses, I can start to gentle them."
Yeah?
And how do you plan on doing that?
"Hopefully, right under Matt's nose, and then I'll find homes for them."
Great.
Hey.
"It's really beautiful out there, Amy."
You wanna go for a walk?
"You should, you should."
I'll-I'll put wood on the fire and keep it going till you get back.
"Instead of feeling sad thinking about silly past, I'm peaceful  happy now."
You bloody!
Sister!
What's this?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you bringing to our home?
What's your game?
My plan is...
Are you playing games?
May I tell you?
You fool!
Who are you?
Are you trying to play with me in India and my brother-in-law here?
Has he forgotten the past?
Is that why he didn't recognise me?
Hey Kick!
Now I got you in my hands.
"Give me some of your revenge, allow me to stay with him,"
I'll make him see stars in day time.
"One small request, don't tell anyone here about our story in India."
You too don't tell anyone about our plan.
Have you lost your memory?
Now I'll give you kick of the life.
Sleeping like a log.
I'll give him the shock of his life.
What's it Prakash?
Unable to sleep.
"Come, sleep."
- What happened?
- What's that?
This...
I hate any cloth on my body when I sleep except this blanket.
What's that?
Don't tell me.
That's European or something?
Bet you got a story to tell.
This is Davis Hartley here.
I'm not some nickel and dime street mutt.
I'm not trying to rip you off or anything.
It would be stupid.
A guy like you?
Got a couple pounds of Lead in his eyes?
What's that?
Is that maybe grief or something like that?
You want to talk about it?
Maybe you think I'm trying to rip off your experiences to put 'em in my novel.
But that's not true.
Davis Hartley is not some moral cretin.
Not precisely.
I'm trying to make a point here.
I'm a professional New York City car driver.
You know what that means?
I'm the greatest individual at being able to find anything in the world.
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
- I don't know what a penguin would be-
- Stop talking.
Please stop talking!
Hello!
Stop talking!
You want to help?
"After I stop, I'll be busy for a while."
Find a guy named...
Alex Bohemia.
Who do you think I am?
"That Joe, collecting stuff like that."
It used to be just guns.
- What sort of trick you got in mind?
- A small wall type.
My f amily bible.
"When you spot your job, holler."
- There.
Am I right?
- That looks right.
That one?
It's a pipe.
What's the layout?
Martinelli's private office at the Sanctuary Club.
I was willing to turn a trick because you're Al's f riend.
I'd cut it off to here f or Al.
But I ain't souping Martinelli's safe.
"I've built up a legitimate business here, with a positive f uture."
"Forget it, Murdock."
Wash it out of your mind.
No grease. it wouldn't do me any good with sand in my mouth.
"If it's a pipe, couldn't you show him how to do it?"
How you like that?
"Murdock, you got something there."
"I have a letter l want to get, and she wants me to get it."
"Lady, there was a time I could have used you."
I'll show you how in five minutes flat.
Come on.
- Where next?
- Where does Martinelli live?
Crescent Beach.
Why?
"Suppose you drive around, show me the sights and wind up there after dark."
"All right, guys."
"Winner takes all, a week without chores."
"Prepare to meet your doom, boys."
"Not tonight, French Fries."
This game is mine.
You know why the Flyers suck?
Lt all comes down to Lindros.
What a waste.
Sucked us dry and left us for dead.
"So, you gonna kiss me tonight or what?"
- Pair of nines.
- Pair of trois.
"Triple aces, boys."
I win again.
- Tweaker!
- Tweaker!
"You know I really like you, right?"
So you'd have to like gnaw on my lip for this to totally suck.
I guess it's not like in the movies where kisses magically happen at exactly the right moment.
Just like the formation of rainbows.
Wow.
Can you imagine if I told other people that you actually said that?
- It could be your dad.
- I'm in the shower.
- There's a thought.
"- Easy, pilgrim."
- It could be the guys.
- You gave them my number?
What?
I made pizza and we were gonna have purple cows after we kissed.
"Look, I'll make it up to you."
I'm sorry.
"- Oh, no worries."
"- Ok, uh..."
"You know, there's something I wanted to ask you, something Brandon told me about the night before he was attacked."
Mike was drinking?
Yeah.
"He had a little slip, but he's been sober ever since, going to meetings every day."
"Oh, that's great."
Good for him.
Brandon said that he was in a fight.
"Yeah, I guess so."
He blacked out so he didn't really remember anything.
"Oh, gosh..."
But there was blood on his hands when you found him?
That's...
A little.
He was fine.
- Was it his blood?
- Stef.
"If you have questions about Mike's sobriety, you have to ask him."
Of course.
Of course I should.
You're right.
Sorry.
Thank you so much for the coffee.
Appreciate it.
"All right, Jude, just keep your eye on the ball, buddy."
Takes a little getting used to.
"Just hang in there, kid."
"Um, you might wanna hang on to the bat a little tighter too."
"Here, grab another one, all right?"
"Hey, Connor, let's go, come on."
"Throw a token in there, let's see what you got."
Ms. French.
I found just the cabin upgrade you were looking for.
- You work fast.
- Follow me.
This was Amanda Kane's cabin.
Nice work.
It's been over a week.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Cleaning crew might have missed something.
So what happened?
You know as much as I do.
Amanda got on the boat and disappeared.
No.
"I mean, what happened with you after the story broke?"
You can Google all the ugly details.
"Kate, if you don't want to tell me, I'll drop it."
It was like...
A bomb went off.
"I destroyed my life, and I hurt everyone else in the process."
"I lost my fiance, my career."
But you know what the worst part was?
What?
Facing my mother.
"That day, she was crushed."
"She says she forgives me, but she hasn't looked at me the same way since."
You sure you want to do this?
What?
Search the room?
"No, not search the room."
Rescue a woman who ruined your life.
Amanda Kane didn't ruin my life.
She saved it.
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky I do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
"I don't know if it's my old ears, or the subway underneath."
- Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
- He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury..."
I heard about that.
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't want to hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
- Why?
- Because he's my boy.
"There's oil under that vacant lot, Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politic me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President you're going to forget who got you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
Or we get lost seriously the great feast of the white city.
You are the only ...
And you have not done anything ...
Leon?
It is the prince of the idiots!
"I had to do it during his sleep, but thou hast thou awakened."
I wrapped the blade in the silk but she does not suffer.
"Courage, come."
Want to finish?
"- Marie, I love her."
- And to me ...
- Do you love me?
"- Yes, certainly."
Right.
He told me that no other he love like me.
And then I said that was not important.
"My father, my mother, you ..."
"I'amore ... the same foot, the same toes,"
Ie the same footsteps.
The footsteps are dependent on the soles.
The mud without trace.
It's me.
"You have the cold, six warm,"
"six warm burn,"
kill.
I want to finish now?
Do not make the idiot.
"Take off your shoes, so think that we are no longer here."
Do not give to anyone.
"No, it's mine."
If we had done God we would have made ... otherwise.
Mickey!
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
What the hell is he doing?
Is he a waiter here?
What's wrong with him?
"Oh my goodness, what are you doing?"
Hey!
How many are in your family?
I have four.
"If you also have four, we're a perfect match."
You pervert!
"Dad, help me."
Me?
Not me.
So you're with him?
- With him?
Who?
I?
- Come here.
- I'm gonna kill you today.
- don't know him!
It goes down really smooth.
"Sorry, it's just that you eat so beautifully."
I haven't seen anyone eat ramen noodles as sexy as you do.
"Actually, I'm a writer."
So whenever I see anything beautiful I can't let it pass.
I'm sort of a workaholic.
I want to eat it.
'I want to eat ramen.' That's the title.
I suddenly got that poetic vibe.
Pink tiny glamorous lips Like blooming nipples
Slightly open
Your tongue that's like a shell's flesh
Accepts without any reservations Those erected noodles
And I can't betray him.
"Not now, or ever."
We must apprehend this Calvetti.
Do the impossible.
Be quick.
You're crazy; they're looking for you.
- I came here to give myself up.
There's nothing else I can do.
- No.
But it's me they want.
I can't let you die in my place.
Watch out!
The guards.
Everything in order?
- Everything.
I brought her meal.
Don't worry.
I'm not here to hurt you.
"If it was up to me, I'd let you kill whoever you want."
Bon appetit.
Save yourself.
It would be crazy to give yourself up.
What good would that do?
Everyone's against us.
"Lucrezia, Giacomo, even Martina."
- Martina?
The maid.
She told the judges I had ordered her to let you into the castle.
Martina said that?
They must have paid her to make a false statement.
We must find her and force her to tell us everything she knows.
Meeting me has cost you dearly.
"No, thank you."
"You don't want to touch the consecrated objects, do you?"
"Step back, please."
The train is about to leave.
Come on.
- I've calculated ten minutes to the refinery.
- Excellent.
I hope the train won't be late.
"All right, my dear chaplain."
Let's go.
"Hey, Padre Julio!"
How long have you been back?
What a surprise!
Are you going to keep us company?
Tell us a funny story.
- Will this wagon blow up as well?
"- Well, the bomb is close to it."
"Come on, we're about to leave."
I'm really glad to see you again.
- How are you?
"- I'm fine, and you?"
"- Same old, same old."
- Take my hand.
- This is Padre Alonso.
- Pleased to meet you.
Why don't you sit down?
What happened to Padre Aginaldo?
The poor chap has appendicitis.
We had him taken to Puerto Silas.
That's why the bishop sent Padre Alonso.
- I'm going with him to show him the area.
- I'm sorry to hear about Padre Aginaldo.
"- Rick, stop him!"
- Hey!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
[ Man ] What's the matter?
It's not cold.
"[ Woman ] Bobby, it's cold!"
"Come on, Diane."
[ Woman Screeches ]
"[ Man Talking, Indistinct ] [ Both Laughing ]"
[ Bobby ] What's the matter?
[ Diane Screeches ] Bobby!
"Oh, I'm gonna get you."
No.
It's cold!
"[ Bobby ] Come on, Diane."
Let's go swimming.
[ Screeches ]
[ Giggling ]
"Diane, you're gonna be at sea before Jessie even realizes you've left the club."
Jessie doesn't scare me.
"Well, if it's Dutch--"
"It's you, Bobby."
"Diane, I love you, and I'm gonna marry you."
That's what scares me.
"All of this is just-- It's all too good to be true, and I just keep thinking that something's gonna happen to spoil it."
Like what?
I don't know.
That's because nothing's gonna happen.
"In two hours, we're gonna be married, and you'll be on the boat to San Diego."
"And when I join you next month, we're gonna have the rest of our lives to raise beautiful little girls... just like you... and nasty little boys just like me."
"Bobby, if something did go wrong, you wouldn't ever forget me, would you?"
Will you just stop it and listen to me?
Then the wrong one it is.
"When in the jungle, protect your life, Not your pride."
I'm sharper than the dagger.
Watch your step.
What's your intention?
Doom.
I knew that Muraakis' brains are below their waist.
Accept defeat.
My next strike might kill you.
Try to not kill yourself.
For me.
Kill me.
I cannot stay here.
I won't be able to go back.
"We let Paathar go, Saiba is now ours."
He cannot be defeated even by a beast...
A Muraaki can be killed only by deceit.
Saiba is yours.
First we marry.
"Jilaan loves wars, then why this marriage?"
"Oh Muwaqqit, what do you gain by conquering the world?"
"Bodies meet, bodies perish."
"Souls meet, they together forever flourish."
Kaabir?
Why are you here?
Saiba forgot why she is here.
Jilaan shall no longer even look at our Ghat.
- Didn't you get the message?
- I got the message.
But I didn't get Saiba.
I'll take Saiba with me...
After killing Jilaan.
Touch me.
"Oh, no."
[whispers]:
Human contact...
that's how you show empathy.
Oh!
How is the back of your hand clammy?
"All right, lightning round."
[buzzer sounds]
So there's no future for us?
"Well, I don't know what you're up to, but I'm going to Burger King after this."
[buzzer sounds]
I thought we had something.
We did have something.
A one-night stand.
[buzzer sounds]
Is there someone else?
There's everyone else.
[buzzer sounds repeatedly]
"Oh, my God!"
"I have been trying to help you for hours, and at best, you have made zero progress."
It is like you are incapable of caring.
Maybe I was right: you are a monster.
Wow.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I can tell how frustrating this is for you.
"No, I don't think you..."
"Wait, what did you just say?"
"Um, I'm sorry?"
Jack!
You cared about how I felt!
That's empathy!
Thank you.
You can finish early.
"No, I'll stay to the end."
You're a trooper.
It's my last day.
What will you do in Korea?
I want to open a store with my mother.
- With your mother?
- Yes.
Mom endured a lot of hardships for me.
Dad died in a car accident when I was only two.
"After that, Mom raised me all by herself."
She sold clothes at a market until the morning.
It was tough on her.
I'm going home to return the favor.
How old is she?
57 years old.
"If my mom was alive, she'd be the same age."
She passed away?
"Two years ago, breast cancer."
"I was a troublemaker, a constant headache for her."
Kept getting mixed up with the police.
Mom apologized for me every time.
Now I feel horrible about it.
"Maybe I'm not one to talk, but take care of your mother."
I will.
"Say, Kubota San, did you come up with the name Juicy Fruits?"
"There was a band named Juicy Fruits, and I liked the vocalist, Ilia."
So that's where my name comes from.
"Hello, thank you for calling Juicy Fruits."
We'll miss you.
Thanks for everything.
Was she pregnant?
Why else?
For fun?
"The very day they caught them, Papa sent her to Paris."
And two months later we all left Algeria-.
Things were bad enough for the Jews as it was.
But Maurice didn't give up.
He followed her to Paris.
Finally they decided to send her to Israel because he couldn't go there.
She went to the kibbutz where she met your father.
And they never saw each other again?
- I don't know.
- When she came to visit.
"She came to rest and see me, that's all I know."
"And this Maurice, where is he?"
Did you know all this?
Not until two hours ago.
So why did you come here?
To ask you to come home.
Now that I've heard things that your mother never told me
"I'm begging you, come home."
Live your lives.
"Honor your mother, she didn't want us to know."
- Are you going home?
- What do you care?
"Rosa, will you see me out?"
Regards to Ricky.
I say we go home.
You can go.
I'm not leaving until we find this Maurice guy.
You believe that old drunk's bullshit?
"One thing doesn't make sense, Aunt Rosa."
I was always strongly attracted to you.
And you knew it.
So did Wilton.
That's why The Foundation saw so little of me.
"Elizabeth, we've known each other for too long not to keep it simple."
What is it you want?
"Oh, Devon, you know better than that."
"When Sigmund Freud lay dying, his students all gathered about him and they asked if there was one question his work had not answered."
"And he replied,"
"""What a woman really wants. """
"Well, there's no need to be coy."
"Well, there's certainly no need to rush."
The future is still the future.
It will reveal itself when it chooses.
.
"Oh, a storm is threatening."
.
My very life today.
.
If I don't get some shelter.
.
"Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away."
.
"War, children."
.
"It's Just a shot away, it's Just a shot away.."
"Boy, do I feel lucky."
"Well, then don't play with her."
- That he killed himself to save our destinies?
"If it's any consolation,"
I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
I'm fine.
Just let it be.
A full compliment.
"To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go."
"- Well, actually..."
- We're not coming with you.
"With Savage gone, we want to start fresh, see what happens."
"I give it three months, tops."
"Look, I just..."
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.
"- Ray, I..."
- No.
This is...
it's meant to be.
I wish both of you nothing but the best.
Be safe.
See you guys around.
"Every time they do that,"
I get hungry for chicken.
"So, shall we?"
- Is that...
- The Waverider.
Another Waverider?
"Whatever it is, it's not slowing down."
Get down!
What the hell's going on?
"To be honest, Mr. Jackson, I have absolutely no idea."
Is this 2016?
- you know i love you.
- that's not what i asked you.
"- well, you're my mama."
and that's all that matters.
"- but you know i love you, right?"
- i know that you've got your own way of showing it.
are you okay?
- [sighs] i got some things to figure out.
- [sighs] harley.
"i love you very, very much, all right?"
but i need you to go back to bed now.
"- mama, if you need anything, i'm here."
"and i will do anything for you, mama."
you know that. right?
"- i do know that, and that's what worries me."
come here.
"now you get on back to bed, 'cause tomorrow is christmas."
"- but, mama."
- go on.
do as you're told.
- good night.
- good night.
[sighs]
[door creaks]
"[car door closes, engine turns over]"
[dialing]
"- ho, ho, ho."
"you've reached bob, marjorie, and tim."
"we're at the outlet mall, shopping for your christmas presents, so we can't take your call right now, but we sure do want to talk to you."
leave a message at the sound of the beep.
[beep]
"- hi, uncle bob."
I always know who you are.
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Take the pills.
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.
He doesn't listen to me.
I know a damn speciation when I see one.
A what?
a young one.
There are forces trying to kill them.
Forces?
They want help.
forces.
It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
they want you.
that's how fucking stupid they are.
They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty. a long time.
There are no new mutants.
Understand?
Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years.
Not anywhere.
You always thought we were part of God's plan.
But maybe...
Maybe we were God's mistake.
What a disappointment you are.
When I found you you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.
Hooked on barbiturates.
You were an animal.
But we took you in.
I gave you a family.
And they're gone now.
Logan.
What ever happened to that Amazon he used to go around with?
That Felice...
Felice something?
She was mad about him.
He wants to marry me.
"It would even things up, wouldn't it?"
We'd both be married.
It would make things so much fairer from now on.
-From now on?
-When we run into each other.
We won't.
"We know the same people, we go to the same places."
"-It would be difficult not to, wouldn't it?"
-Not at all.
"But what possible harm could there be in our having a drink now and then, or lunch?"
A great deal of harm.
"All right, Bran."
I'm sorry.
I just thought it might be fun.
"And remember, Isabel, there will be no telephone calls in the middle of the night, no mysterious telegrams, nothing."
We're not gonna have any trouble.
"I'll do exactly what you want, Bran."
Exactly what you want.
Oh.
"Oh, Alec."
"I just ran into Brandon Bourne, an old friend."
"Hello, Bourne, I've heard a great deal about you."
Get me a cab!
"Quick, get me a cab!"
Rosa.
How do you feel?
Baffled.
First of June.
"Xiaotian, will be graduated."
Don't catch a cold!
"Drink it, chicken soup."
Drink all of it!
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!
It's all because of me!
Why do you cry again?
"Except cry, what else can I do?"
It's for you.
- For me?
"- Your 18th birthday gift, one week ahead."
"I'm afraid to see you cry, and I can't leave you."
"So I wrote this letter,"
I have to give up myself.
Please forgive me if I often lied to you.
Forgive my cruelty to have your baby aborted!
It's because I don't want you live in agony and remorse of youself.
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
"I knew that all these years, you have been treating me just like your brother."
I can never replace the position of Xiaotian... in your mind.
"However, I'm still willing to do anything for you!"
Willing to be there whenever you need me!
Willing to be someone most you trusted!
"So, Yawang."
"Don't say sorry for me, because..."
I love you!
"Judge,"
I have to accuse Qu Weiran of rape.
MAX:
"Oh, nonsense."
I also collected some crickets and caterpillars for our dining pleasure.
They're an excellent source of protein.
I grabbed what I could... before our ship burnt up.
"If we ration it, could last us a few days."
"Talk to me, what do we have?"
(sighs)
Mochi balls.
Love those.
And a bottle of ouzo.
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?
MAX:
That sounds delightful.
"Sorry, cuz."
"If I die first,"
I want you to eat me.
Nobody's gonna eat you.
"So what are you saying, I'm not good enough for you?"
Why wouldn't you eat me?
"Guys, over here!"
"Check it out,"
"Doctor, regular MacGyver."
"Actually, it's basic physics."
The lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn.
Now all we need to do is stoke the flame.
"I'll do you one better, brah."
Oh!
- Yeah!
Whoa.
It's always nice to have flammable material.
FLIPPA:
"What about your store, Ladyjaan, and your customers?"
Is it not right for us to go back to where we belong?
"Not for me, Ladyjaan."
Are you not angry at what they did to you?
"Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan."
But I still have both my eyes and I have such friends.
"Haroun, you have found so much more than wealth here."
You came for a dream and found love.
"Now, what did you bring for me?"
It's for Hameeda.
"Well, actually... it's for you both... together."
Lotus root.
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.
Here it is.
What do you think?
It's uh...
It's beautiful.
Is this yours?
"Oh, yeah."
"It's an old bakery, actually."
I just love the idea of making old things new.
There's something cool about it.
"Forgive me, Doug, but I have to return to where I belong."
You showed me such love.
Thank you.
But it cannot be.
I do not expect you to understand.
But there is no other way.
I'm sorry.
I will carry your love with me forever.
Spices.
"My strong advice, sir, would be to appoint some of them to the jury."
"It would be not only prudent, but fair."
Fair?
They was gonna hang that man without a trial.
"All right, Litefoot."
You're appointed prosecutor.
Tell Sheriff Stains I'll pick some people for the jury from Eagle Bend.
"It's unorthodox, but I want this trial to be fair for everyone."
You can also tell the sheriff we're on the job here.
"That he will, gentlemen."
That he will.
Good day.
Can I have a cell like that?
-Ma'am.
-Nathan.
-Ma'am.
-l'll get you some blankets.
Make it real comfortable for you.
Daddy?
"Daddy, you all right?"
Fine. I'm fine.
Look at you.
Grown into a fine man.
After I knew you made it north...
... Iusedto dreamaboutyou...
... livingasafreeman.
"Daddy, you didn't have to stay."
You could have come with me.
I would have slowed you down.
"-You, uh, want some supper?"
-After a while.
All right.
So like we told your people.
I can't imagine what these last 18 months have been like.
"So what do you want from us, Agent Pritchard?"
I want to start again.
If you have anything of Kevin's from that time...
We haven't touched his room.
So you can take whatever you want if it helps.
[Sniffles]
But don't call us again unless you have answers.
This is everything from Kevin's room?
Yep.
"So, start your timeline at zero."
What's your first event?
I'm gonna start with the suicide at SSU.
It happened a month before the first killing.
I'm not ready to call that a coincidence.
All right.
We'll call it event one.
Kevin Whitfield's event two.
"God, it's weird being here."
It looks just like your old place.
"Yeah, I kind of like it here."
Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
"Hey, you don't have mine, do you?"
I'd like to see who came to my funeral.
"No, you wouldn't."
[Scoffs]
"Duval, did you really bust my car window 'cause I made your mom cry?"
Yeah.
I did.
Good for you.
Liz Kenyon.
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
"But... whether I find one or not, you bury the German girl tomorrow."
"You know, he does have a point there, Sam."
"Oh, come on, Al."
I didn't leap in here just to bury Hilla.
"Well, there's nothing else that figures--"
Except-
"- Except if she was murdered, and the killer was never caught."
"Uh, well, look, if the chief finds the gun in the lake--"
He won't.
And-
"- And even if he does, it just means that the killer threw the gun in the water."
"Boy, you won't give up, will ya?"
Not when I feel I'm right.
All right.
Say you're right.
We find the gun-- even find someone to trace it to.
What does that prove?
You have no bullet to match it to.
I know.
"I know, Al."
It just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I mean, where's the bullet?"
"Talkin' to the stiffs again, Melvin?"
- Excuse me?
- That's the great thing about a stiff.
"They don't talk back, but, boy, can they listen."
[ Al ] Uh-oh.
"Uh, Sam, if-- if she's gonna do what..."
"I think she's gonna do, uh,"
I'm out of here.
"You okay, Melvin?"
Yeah.
"God, that's terrifying."
I know.
Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.
"He thinks I don't know, but I know."
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.
Is that where Javier took him?
Oh.
You did not know that.
I'm sorry.
But it... it looked like one of the classier establishments.
"The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap had on a really cute top, at... at least in the first picture."
"The one time that I thought that he was going to be a good father, and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!"
I'm gonna kill him!
"Hey, look at me!"
I'm about to talk to a stranger!
(exhales sharply)
(slow rock music plays)
"Oh, yes."
This is it.
This is the one.
Ugh.
It wasn't this depressing last night.
The lunch scene in a strip joint is like a refugee camp with less hope.
Excuse me.
"Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night."
Anything left behind...
- goes in the lost and found.
- There we go.
Thank you.
"There's a jacket... glasses... hairpiece, I hope..."
- What about my stuff?
No.
Marius ran.
Leaving you with me.
Maybe I should thank him.
You know?
Well?
"Well, what?"
"Well, isn't there any part of you that has a bad feeling about this?"
You thought Lance was cheating on you with some lady named Victoria.
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
Victoria's a character he created
- to scam Grandma.
- Do you have any idea how fucking preposterous that sounds?
That doesn't make it untrue.
"Carly, move it!"
"Lance claims to have lost more money than Audrey on that deal, yet he's buying a boat."
Where is he getting the money from?
"For fuck's sake, let's ask him."
"Ask a question, you get an answer."
That doesn't necessarily get you the truth.
I can get you the truth.
I just need a day.
- That's it?
- That's it.
And one more thing.
[door opens]
Can I help you?
Ex...
Ex-ex-ex...
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
This is private property.
Says here they got reason to believe they're headed for Houston.
Seems to me they just may fit the description of the folks you boys are after.
Son of a bitch.
Think we may even have a photograph of them.
They ran out of a convenience store earlier.
Surveillance camera?
"Yeah, I think so."
Texas.
"Looks like they're headed our way, boys."
"Hey, you got another cup?"
"Sure, if you don't mind drinking after me."
"No, not at all."
Goddamn.
Texas.
Whew.
You think it was our people who whacked that state trooper?
We'll know as soon as we get the photo.
Hurricane...
He's waiting on the bad guys the way a kid waits for Christmas.
"Yeah, well, Hurricane's a force of nature."
I like old Hurricane.
Nice fellow.
You know what he told me this morning?
What?
He said he was thinking of coming to L.A. and joining the force.
You're kidding.
Honest to God.
He said that he thought me and him and Mackintosh would make a hell of a team.
No shit.
(LAUGHING) He said he wanted to take a crack at the big time.
Jesus.
What did you say?
Give me that.
Wait for me.
Miss Carrol!
"Hello, kids."
No wonder this school is losing money.
Everybody late every morning.
Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs.
"Yes, and that goes for you girls, too."
"Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing."
One would.
"Miss Anderson, good morning."
"If you're late again, you'll be fired, too."
That's final.
I have nothing more to say.
That's good.
"- Is that you, Mabel?"
- I don't know.
"Tell me, is it?"
- Kind of sounds like you.
- That's a load off my mind.
I'm never sure these days.
- Did you see a young...
- Visitors make the pupils self-conscious.
"Would you mind waiting a second, please?"
"- That's no if, Gus!"
- Supposed to be pretty good!
He won the intercollegiate a couple years ago?
I never seen a college Joe yet take a belt on the kisser!
!
without phoning his mother!
"He's a good man, but I'll take him!"
I can feel it!
Thank you.
"So, what, you're just never gonna have sex again?"
Probably not.
It's funny.
"You know, I never had a problem screwing in a bed where another guy's been."
You've never had a problem screwing in a woman where another guy's been.
You told him you were dangerous?
You're so non-dangerous.
I know!
"But I swear, with him, I feel like I could be."
Mm-hmm.
There's something about him that's so dynamic.
This confidence...
I have not felt this excited about work in I don't know how long.
Dear God... exhale.
Oh.
Oh!
And let me tell you... is that boy easy on the eyes.
Don't.
I know... don't do voices.
Thank you.
"Seriously, he is hot."
"Obviously, I would never go there."
Please.
You keep an apartment there.
Nope.
Not gonna happen.
"I'm happy just to be around him, to work with him, to learn from him."
He is amazing.
"I hear myself talking to these people, and..."
They're listening to me.
"I mean, really listening and nodding."
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
I couldn't take the shot.
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"- No, he couldn't."
"- What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
- I'm stuck here with you.
- Yeah.
Did you ever see me not backing you up?
I always back you up.
Why do you think I started with these intensive courses?
Ask me why?
I'm telling you I'll make an album for you.
- Really?
"- Of course, it's real."
- Promise?
- I promise.
"Ooh, look who's here."
"Yes, Mert. 3012 Mert."
Rafet.
"Actually, 69 Rafet."
What are we doing here?
"We'll leave, professor."
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you see?
I've been thinking of giving Rafet a nickname for a long time.
"- 69 Rafet is super, professor."
- Give me that camera.
You take this camera and get lost.
Close the door too.
Photo...
What are you doing?
Sinan... the camera...
What do you guys want?
What are you doing here?
"Well, would you believe me if I said we were just passing by?"
What are you doing here?
"We were just checking the inventory here, and I felt hot in the jacket."
"To do, you know, the warehouse is stuffy."
"We, Rafet and I, will be married soon and build a happy house."
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast!
This'll take weeks to repair.
"Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2."
My ship has run off course en route to sector 1 2.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa!
Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to.
Sorry.
Howdy.
My name is Woody.
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
"And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up."
"This is my spot, see, the bed here."
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
"I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit."
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
"Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot."
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
"Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?"
- So what happened?
- I don't know.
There was a short-circuit...
- I can't believe that.
- Suri.
Wait.
Suri.
- It cut out.
- What cut out?
There was a short
- Ben just told me.
Everything went down.
Why weren't you honest with me?
I looked like an idiot in there.
- I'm sorry.
"- How am I supposed to do my job, knowing you were at the casino the night Lau died?"
"- Yeah, I should have told you that."
"- And yet, once again, you didn't."
"You're the reason I've got to where I am, Harry."
Everything I've learnt has come from you these two years but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you screw it up for me.
Detective Superintendent Winter and I couldn't be quite sure who was interviewing who.
"Yeah, you have to think the way they do."
- Should be quite easy for you.
- You'd be a smart arse if you were smart.
Trouble in the dream team?
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
What?
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
When you..
"- When you look at the coating, will you beat that guy up on the price?"
Kevin!
That is not a real toilet.
"Dad, what's going on?"
Is everything okay?
Please tell me he's not peeing in the store.
It's nice to take a moment and just relax.
Dad?
I gotta go.
I don't know him and there's no way I'm going near him.
"Grandpa, there's no toilet paper."
Help me get my shirt off.
"You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp."
They want you to be in debt.
That's how it works.
"They give you these credit cards you can't pay for,"
"HD, motorcycles."
It's all a pimp game.
I BELIEVE IN ANGELS
"God, grant me the serenity To accept the things"
I cannot change.
Grant me courage To change the things I can.
And wisdom To know the difference.
Marcus Aurelius (121-180)
No blessing.
I'm not giving my blessing.
Where would she go without a blessing?
"Shut up, woman."
"A fine job you did, raising her."
What I've been telling you?
"Only maybe I was buying a lot more than that, and didn't know it."
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
It was a nice little house.
"He'd probably paid 4 or 5000 for it, before houses went up."
"From all I hear, it would probably bring 15 G's by now."
"And here was this guy, McGee, all nicely reformed."
"Chances are, it's the first house he ever lived in."
"When this is over, go see him, Father."
You two would get along.
But I had something else on my mind right then.
- What'll it be?
"- Phone company, checking calls."
Did you get one f rom St. Louis a little while ago?
"- Hiya, Murdock?"
"- Okay, McGee."
Step right in.
"Oh, McGee, this is Mike."
"Hiya, Mike?"
I'm fine now.
- What a nice place you've got.
- lt's messed up right now.
"Joe, that's my kid, he brought this junk back f rom Japan."
Joe took this off a Nip colonel.
Ain't it a pip?
"Almost cut your head off, didn't I?"
Joe says these are new.
- Those are German.
- That's what Joe said.
How'd you know?
I'd turn them into Army ordnance.
Start coughing too hard there'll be nothing left but the gold in your teeth.
Holy smoke!
So?
JOHN:
"So, do we talk to the mother?"
What if she tips off Lila?
She wouldn't do that.
"She wouldn't do that, not Lila."
Have you heard from Lila?
"No, I haven't, not since last summer."
"Sometime around June, July."
"Mr. Dixon, you know Lila, you know she wouldn't do what they're saying she did."
"They must have kidnapped her, brainwashed her."
"Miss Walker, some of the best policemen in this country are after Lila and those other two fellas."
"Now, they're going to catch them too."
It will go a lot better for Lila if she turns herself in.
"Chief Dixon is right, ma'am."
"I can't make any promises, but if your daughter cooperates with us, that will be taken into account later."
I haven't heard from her.
"But if I do, I'll tell her what you said."
"Ronnie, you heard from your sister?"
"No, sir."
Would you tell us if you had?
"Yes, sir."
Grandma...
I'm hungry.
MRS. WALKER:
"Byron, don't bother us now, honey."
JOHN:
Who's that?
That's Lila's boy.
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?
And he's a pretty boy too.
Thanks for your time.
- We are.
What's happening in D.C.?
I'm working on legislation that would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It will be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.
- It'd be groundbreaking.
- Impressive.
- The other...
- For the record?
I don't see why I should be the one to take the fall for this.
- I wasn't the only one that knew.
- You're bearing the brunt because you're here.
"Believe me, I wish that Tommy and Kevin were here too."
- Is it always like this?
- You dreamed of having a baby sister.
"Sarah, you know what?"
"I was six, OK?"
That wish didn't include Dad cheating on Mom.
"I didn't know what to do, Kitty."
So I thought the best thing to do was nothing.
So shoot me.
Oh.
Do you like cigars?
I got some good ones and we could...
That would be great.
You didn't know what to do so you did nothing.
"I would've told you, Sarah!"
"Justin, where are you?"
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
- I can't make it.
I'm sorry.
- What?
My mom's been cooking all day.
Me.
... who has dedicated his entire life...
How would you like to be lmogene's godfather?
... to himself.
You must be joking.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"The thing is, a person's life is like a TV show."
"Oh, my God."
- Can I come in?
- No.
"I was the star of ""The Will Show""."
"And ""The Will Show"" wasn't an ensemble drama."
You will end up childless and alone.
"Both fingers crossed, yeah."
And then something terrible happened.
Something I'd tried to avoid all my life.
"This year, Will's life is going to change."
"Alone, bad."
"Friend, good."
He's reaching out.
I want to go out with her.
- I'd like her to be my girlfriend.
- Brilliant!
"Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
He fancies you.
He told me.
"From the producers of ""Meet the Parents""."
I think I killed a duck.
"Jesus, what a family."
I was in some strange territory.
Was I frightened?
So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
From your Valentine's bitch.
PS:
"And on my face."""
"That's my favourite, I like the way she remembered the face."
It's funny how all these cards seem to be in the same handwriting.
Your admirers are either very young or have severe learning difficulties.
Which is possible.
The handwriting's bad cos they were strumming one out as they wrote 'em.
Not you writing with your left hand?
You're just jealous cos I got loads and you got none.
- I got a card.
- If it's your nan it doesn't count.
- I didn't get any then.
- I did get a card.
A proper one.
- Total bollocks.
I was thinking of an annual donation of one million dollars for four years.
But I need more time to think through   which projects I want to get involved with.
So don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay...
I was given a different impression.
"Then let's look at the papers again, because..."
"No, no."
Let's forget the boring paperwork until Monday.
We'll have lunch and I'll let you know what I've decided.
- I've got a busy weekend coming up.
- So I've heard.
I spoke to the guy that drove me here.
He's marrying your daughter?
"- Yes, Christian."
You're not married?
- No.
- Got any family here?
"- No, I don't."
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.
It's a huge wedding.
I don't know half of the guests myself.
- It would be nice.
- I need to...
You don't have any other plans.
We're through.
See you tomorrow?
We're looking forward to it.
- Then I can get to know you.
- Thanks for your time.
"- Hey, dad!"
- How are you?
Were you jumping on the trampoline?
Danny's been moping around all day.
"Oh, please."
"Come on, they're grown men."
Not like they're moping around the streets like some Backstreet Boys video from the '90s.
"Let's do this, you oily donkey."
You're not wearing your diamond stud.
No.
I just wear this for fun.
"I'm off duty, babe."
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Work the alley by yourself.
This is the alley where anything goes.
OK.
"Charlotte said, uh, Trent has the diamond at his apartment."
She wants to know if she should go sleep with him.
Excuse me.
What?
No.
- Tell her no.
- Finally I got to make out with Adam.
"That lunatic's back only if you go before... by the way, my legs..."
Nobody else hear that?
I'm all packed up.
"Going to head to the bar,"
Close early so we can all celebrate the engagement together.
You are still welcome if you want to come.
Nah.
I'm good.
All right.
"Well, if you, uh, if you change your mind, just, you know, come."
- What's wrong with you?
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D the fingerprints yet?"
–There's a backlog.
–Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D her.
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
–You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
–You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
–Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
–You are lying to her.
"–What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"–No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
–Christ!
–Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
–What?
"–Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
There is no enough time to wait for a suitable donor.
The only option left is to arrange for an organ illegally through an agent.
But...
It's very expensive.
I have lost hope fully!
My brother...
Don't say that now...
I'm here to help you.
I'll be there for you.
Listen.
I'm expecting a payment this week.
Give me 2 to 3 days.
I'll somehow arrange for the money.
No.
"No, Vikram."
- Don't talk like an idiot.
This is your brother's life.
That's the priority now.
You proceed with arrangements for the transplant.
We will take care of the rest later.
Priya.
Thank you so much.
"A boat load of lies, in those big beautiful eyes of yours."
"You girl, are an anaconda in the disguise of an innocent child."
So...
What's the next plan?
Erode.
Are we going by bus or by train?
Go!
Go fast.
Are you sure it's Vikram?
"Yes, I'm tracking the number you gave."
"""What the hell are you doing, kiddo?"""
Right.
So who was I?
You were the voice in my head.
Like Emile Sayles is...
Like Emile Sayles is a voice in Liz Kenyon's head.
Only she wants him out.
That's what she told me.
"Now, when you used to hear my voice, where were we?"
Where we were putting in the work.
Backyard.
You making me work the heavy bag.
So when she thinks of him is where they put in the hours.
He started working with her in middle school.
So she wants him out.
Maybe she takes him back to where he climbed in.
I've got agents covering 100 possible targets up and down the west coast.
I can't drag away assets because you and I are working out some family crap.
"Well, you know, I thought we were catching Kevin Whitfield's killer."
Me and you.
It's a three-hour drive from here.
We can make it by opening bell.
Let's go.
[Bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
Can you tell me... why are we here?
I don't want you anymore.
It's been long enough.
I'm leaving you here.
You think you brought me here?
!
I brought you!
"Okay,first batch of gold purchased nine months ago and paid for with a money order."
-The second batch... -that was abby.
She was searching non-standard databases with the thirdoman's dna.
She got a hit on a bone marrow donor bank.
Pull it up.
That's not what I expected.
Her father died of leukemia.
Pick her up.
Take dinozzo with you.
You interrogated her and didn't pick up she had sex with finn?
"It was an interview,not an interrogation-- and excuse me if my brain didn't go to the sex place."
Mine would.
I'm sure tt's why you have a leg up on other investigators.
See?
"You say ""leg up,"" i instantly went to the sex place."
hey!
"Whoa,whoa,whoa!"
"Hey,stop!"
stop!
"I'm sorry,I need to go."
I have a showing... at ncis.
What's going on?
Hey.Hey!
Stop pointing a gun at my fe.
She tried to rat on us.
-She means rabbit.
-Rabbit.
Yes.
I was in a hurry for a showing.
Are you arresting her?
Taking her to ncis to answer a few questions.
"Well,I'm coming too."
I...
I've lost my line.
Cut!
Twenty three takes!
I mean he stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War house wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
None of them thought to give him a bloody screen test?
Will Johnnie replace him?
This one has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
He is the tempered.
"If that empath young stays, the film fails, the national case with it."
He's a brave boy.
"With you, or I think so brave."
Is Mr.Baker alright?
He lost one of his grandsons
Oh!
Hit by a tram on shore leave.
Oh!
Must make it so much worse.
"If wasn't ""for"" anything."
Promise to Baker.
"This wasn't ""for"" anything."
Just think people like films.
Because story is a structure.
And...a shape.
Purpose and meaning.
One thing's turned bad.
"It's still part of a plan, you know, it's...it's...there's a point to it."
I like life.
"You don't believe in a match, do you?"
I believed this was gonna be a good picture.
"It sucks, sixth grade!"
"Feet off the bed, please."
Okay.
Feet off.
"Oh, the heinie bounce."
Good choice.
"Very cute, Harriet, very cute."
"The neighbors will ask me,"
"""What happened to Harriet Welsch?"""
"""I don't know,"" I'll answer."
"""Such a shame."
"""She disappeared without a trace."
"And she was so adorable."""
"How long have you been with me, Golly?"
Since you were born.
"11 years and 12,000 tomato sandwiches ago."
"And you'll never leave me, right?"
"Well, I won't leave you ""leave you,"" Harriet, but, you know, one day you're going to be big enough."
"And well... well, big enough to take care of yourself."
And when that day comes you won't need me and I'll be gone.
But you know what?
That day is not today.
"And now, it's time for bed."
Are Mom and Dad tucking me in?
No.
They're at a very fancy party and I bet they're thinking about you right now.
Really.
"Listen, I think I can hear 'em."
Harriet... listen to everything Golly says to you.
"We're drinking champagne and eating caviar, Harriet."
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
[clicker clicks]
Kept me distracted.
Kept me from scratching my scars open.
♫♫ [woman singing opera]
Ahem.
That was my father's.
"Second War, paratrooper."
Dropped men behind the lines at night.
Can't talk.
Snipers.
So... [clicking]
Crickets.
Wow.
[chuckle]
I just want you to know that working on this case has been a gift.
Yes.
"I know that I stumbled at first, but I've grown."
I saw the video.
You surpassed all my expectations.
Thank you.
That' all I've ever wanted.
"To stand in front of a jury, wow them with my eloquence, and... it's all thanks to you."
No.
"And I want you to know that, no matter what happens in this case, it's not going to affect our feelings, is it?"
No.
W-Why do you keep shoving these fucking pictures at me?
"I mean, they do get a closer look."
You got to be really strong to do that.
I don't even know what that means.
When do I get my car back?
That's it?
That's all you got to say to me?
We have to work through this.
"- We have huge issues, Peter."
- All couples do.
I'm guessing our issues are pretty unique.
This...
This is really not the right time to talk.
- When is the right time?
- When it's not my dead husband's birthday.
Fair enough.
- I have to get back.
- I'll call you later.
Where is everybody?
"After Shane tells Silas that man is in the DEA,"
Silas tells Shane he's your boyfriend and you don't care about Judah no more.
"So he smashed the cake and run upstairs, and Silas go outside to fuck up the stucco with a basketball, and Andy go upstairs to get norched."
I eat from stress.
Shit.
Silas.
Silas.
- Talk to me.
- You're insane!
He's a fucking DEA agent!
Yes.
"Yes, he is, but it's okay."
He's okay with it.
So he's a crooked DEA agent.
Even better.
"Peter protects my business, Silas."
"Well, maybe now, but what happens when he breaks up with you?"
Or do you think you're so great that that's never gonna happen?
- What happens when he dumps you?
- He can't do anything to me.
I'm upset with myself.
I live in my fantasies.
"When reality knocks, I don't open."
He tell you?
Briefly.
No need for more.
It would be dangerous.
For you and us.
I thought it over.
You're partially right.
Militancy is getting us nowhere.
Bourgeoise elections even less.
It's a trap.
It's time for action.
No revolution ever avoided it.
French resistance took up arms.
We extol their heroism.
We're the new resistance.
Don't Maoists say that?
Maybe they're right.
So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.
Where do you position yourself?
Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it?
It's easy.
The car comes.
The comrades change vehicles.
Set theirs on fire in the woods.
He'll take you back by motorcycle.
- If it's worth it.
- It's not our call.
"We chose the underground, and its rules."
First one: no questions.
Hey.
Keep your lens up here.
"Guys, Martin Scorsese."
-pleasure to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.
hello.
"I've been listening to your stuff, I Iike it."
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
"That's amazing, actually."
So amazing.
"I've been giving her stuff, and then she gives me stuff."
'm a big  One Direction fan.
They're gonna go all the way.
They're gonna go higher.
"Next time you see them, we're gonna be in wembley Stadium or Giants Stadium."
That's right.
And I'II be right there in the front row.
t's strange going from being around your family constantly to being with these guys.
But lik e knowing that there's four of your best mates it's a great feeling to know that you're not in it by yourself.
I can't believe I'm at MSG!
I'm just a little boy from Bradford and now I'm smashing it!
And you sort of feel so proud.
You feel like your heart could burst sometimes.
AII right.
Let's give it our all.
"Come on, guys."
Come on!
n the back of your mind  there's always this bit of feeling  that you gotta kind of be ready to pick up the pieces if it stops.
And it hasn't stopped.
Sing it!
You sing!
- Maybe he's bi.
- No one's bi.
Ever met a 70-year-old bisexual?
At some point you make a choice.
"Thus the expression, ""Bi now, gay later."""
- Maybe he hasn't decided.
- He better decide.
I can't keep missing work.
My hamstrings are killing me.
I don't know how I'm gonna make it up and down stairs at the Coliseum.
"It's Staples Center, dumb-ass."
Who knew too much sex could make you cranky?
- I wish I was cranky from too much sex.
- What are you and Joe up to tonight?
We are going to a club.
Yeah.
"This, um, band that Joe used to love."
- How very 20-something of you.
- We're in serious need of fun.
Last time I heard my husband laugh was with another mom.
Another mom?
Uh-oh.
Is someone feeling a little possessive?
"Oh, please."
She's hardly the issue.
"So, this club, do they let parents in or is it seniors' night?"
No.
"- Oh, definitely no."
- Come on now.
Hey.
- That is my favorite date dress.
- No wonder you're still single.
You ever seen 'em?
"""Eeeh!"""
"And the mom's like, ""What the fuck?"
"""Oh, my God, why don't you just listen?"
"Why don't you do what I tell you?"""
And the little kid get up all disrespectful.
"""I don't know!"""
"""How come you can't be a good mom, Margaret?"""
Gonna call the mom out by the first name.
I wish I would call my moms out by her first name.
"I would no longer have a mouth on my face, do you hear me?"
I'd be talking from a hole in my neck like Terrie from the smoking commercials.
You ever see her?
¶ You know I'm gonna do it for you ¶
She be...
"""Hi."
"""My name Terrie."
"""And I'm a smoker."
"""And you put on your wig, put in your teeth,"
"""and go about your day."
"I'm a smoker."""
A what?
"""A smoker."""
A mimosa?
"""A smoker!"""
I'm sorry.
"But for everybody who has seen that commercial, that is not just cigarettes."
"That's meth, nigga."
That's what that is.
"Oh, oh!"
"Oh, I would love to see her drinking from a water fountain."
I would love it.
Wanna come with me and check out a real live architecture class?
(EX CLAIMS) Not even a little bit.
"You know, I'll just hang here with Marshall and Lily."
- It'll be fun.
- Fantastic.
- Okay.
"- Well, have a seat."
Relax.
"Yeah, this is casual."
"This is all very, very, very casual."
Listen to me.
You want me to find the perfect girl so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
"Do not let any guy near her, okay?"
"That means no waiter takes her order, no busboy clears her table."
"If she bursts into flames, I want a fire woman putting her out."
I don't think 911 takes requests.
"Damn it, Marshall!"
"Whatever you have to do, keep Maggie Wilks single until I get back."
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?
- Target secure.
"- Oh, my gosh."
How weird.
- (MAGGIE LAUGHS)
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.
"Well, let's all walk back to the booth together."
(WOMEN CHUCKLING)
"(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, my."
"Look at this, the table where we are sitting."
Back off!
"No, no, no."
"It's...it's just that the caption at the end's going to be, ""He's not listening, but the enemy might be""."
It's a joke for women who think their husbands never pay attention.
"So if you start answering, you know, the captions won't make sense."
I wrote it!
The scenario?
I'll be in my dressing room... if anyone needs me.
Everybody take 10.
Save the lights.
Banished from the set?
What in God's name possessed you?
The actor was ruining the script.
Of course he was!
He is an actor.
What's this?
Penance?
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
"With more free time, I should like to do more work."
I simply don't know what to do.
You good with your hands?
I think so.
Yes.
Have you thought about factory work?
"And the version without the lines, please."
Whatever we used footage for carrots.
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
An appetite like his father!
He's eatin' us out the house.
The bank called him right away.
"What do you know about this guy, Stan-- ?"
Whatever his name is.
Why are you putting John in the middle of this?
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Shut up.
I'm asking him.
"I gave him the envelope, because she didn't wanna see him."
WEXLER:
Ever seen him before?
- This guy is a bug.
He's not the type you'd remember.
You people must think I'm too sick to notice 1 5 grand.
I still know what's going on around here.
The cancer's spread all over.
"My liver, my spine."
I'll get maybe a couple of months to live.
- What?
A couple of months?
- A couple of months!
That's the report I got!
That's what I got!
"And then, John I get called about this check."
"Do you understand now about the check, Jimmy?"
She gave it to him for what?
High school dues?
Because he owed money to a bookmaker.
WEXLER:
"So suddenly, she gave it to him because they were in the high school yearbook together."
- You want some soup?
- I don't care.
I don't care.
We'll end the year with our usual nice profit.
We could triple our profits.
And we could go bankrupt.
So you won't even consider it?
"I'm afraid the answer is ""No. """
"But listen, John, if you'd just..."
Hello!
"Oh, did I interrupt anything?"
"No, no, my dear."
We've finished.
"How're you, Harold?"
"Hello, Mrs. Brown."
You didn't tell me you were coming into town today.
"Oh, I thought it'd be fun to pop in and surprise you."
You can take me to lunch.
I'm afraid I have an appointment.
If you'd have mentioned it this morning...
"Well, then it wouldn't have been a surprise."
I'm afraid I can't stand many more surprises today.
Maybe Harold will volunteer to take you to lunch.
"I'm sure Harold has his own plans, dear."
"Nothing important, Mrs. Brown."
I'd be happy to volunteer.
But you do have an appointment.
I'll change it.
It's no problem for a junior partner.
"Goodbye, dear."
"Hors d'oeuvre, madame?"
"Yes, please."
Oeufs a la russe?
Yes.
It must have been a girl.
We'll be coming to Chicago tomorrow.
I wish I had more to tell you guys.
Sometimes it takes a new victim... new input to a case to break it wide open.
We're going to have to do an autopsy.
She marked her driver's license.
The donation was very important to her.
You can imagine.
Is there nothing you can do?
She lost too much blood from the wrist wounds... for them to be in any shape for donation.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
"Well, thank you very much for your kindness."
Brought those home last night... for her.
How many has he killed?
"As far as we know, 2."
Including my wife?
"No, no."
Your wife is number 3.
Don't call my wife a number.
Her name is Margaret Tattersall.
"I'm, uh..."
"I'm real sorry, sir."
What have you been doing down there?
Why didn't you catch him?
What have you been doing?
Want some coffee or anything?
"Oh, no."
I'm in enough trouble already.
But thanks.
OK.
See ya.
Holy shit.
Do you think Brian killed Caleb?
"No, of course not."
But...
I washed it.
What?
Brian's shirt.
There was a lot of blood.
I asked him if it was from the fight.
He wouldn't answer me.
I got scared.
He was acting so crazy.
I didn't know what to do.
I washed it.
I'm so sorry.
Doesn't look good for our shirtless wonder.
"His alibi is definitely shaky, but we also cannot ignore the fact that she washed his bloody shirt."
"- Ah, to be young and in love."
- Huh!
"McGee, any surveillance video from near the crime scene yet?"
"No, but I got something else."
Come here.
"It's about Michael Thomas, and it's not good."
As if Gibbs isn't in a tough enough place with the director.
Turns out that Michael has a record.
As a juvenile.
I got a hit on a charge in Maryland from 1996.
- Records were sealed.
- Come on.
"Let's not panic, okay?"
Kids do stupid stuff.
May not mean anything.
"Well, it depends on the charge."
See you.
Is there anything that you want to do before you go away?
No.
I don't think so.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven."
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation a but deliver us from evil."
Amen.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Beto, give me a glass of water."
I'm very tired.
"Right away, madam."
I have a surprise for you.
The house is not sold.
"No, it's not that."
But don't worry.
Here's some money.
So you and another person can live comfortably.
I want to thank you for all these years you took care of the house.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Lupe?
Can you come to the house?
Right now.
But come in through the back door because the driver is here and he might see you.
Yes.
Okay.
Hurry!
Here.
Don't worry.
I'm fine now.
Going through all that without a father made me realize
That I don't need one.
I understand that I've lost the right
"To be a father to you, but..."
If there's any way that we can get to know each other...
On your terms...
"Serena may want a relationship with you,"
But I don't.
"Serena, stop it!"
You can't do that.
"The room was on loan, and I'm taking it back."
And I don't care if I did leave it in the closet.
"Borrowing without asking is stealing, Jenny."
"Dad, tell her to stop!"
"Uh, Serena, please."
I think it's great
"That you're moving back in, but this is Jenny's room now."
All her things are here.
You can stay in Chuck's old room.
No way.
That room is haunted by Chuck's depravity.
Jenny can take it.
I'm sure it wouldn't bother you.
"Okay, what-what's going on with you two?"
Nothing.
Fine.
Whatever.
Serena can have her old room back.
"All right, that's ridiculous."
"Serena, I'll have Laryssa make up Chuck's bed for you."
AVON:
Tarrant!
Tarrant!
Listen...
Let's go.
- Tarrant!
Tarrant!
"- It's no use, he's cut off."
- Damn.
"- Well, that is it."
"With those ships out there, we can't wait."
They might not be looking for us.
Are you crazy?
You said yourself that was a search formation.
"They haven't picked up Tarrant, so why have they assumed a ship's out here?"
Just a minute.
"Orac, that message from Space Centre, how was it relayed here?"
Through Terminal 4006.
- The terminal on Helotrix.
"- Of course, Avon."
- That is the nearest terminal to our position.
- That's it.
They must have intercepted the transmission.
Computer logic.
The nearest terminal.
"So Orac's thick, we all know that."
Let's move!
- I'm going in under them.
- What?
We'll go down to cloud level.
"If we stay between them and the planet, we may not show up on their scanners."
Once we're below them we'll be cut off.
"Lower it very gently, lower it."
(Boards creaking)
Very nice.
Tie it off.
Tie it off.
"My God, that was heavy."
Good work.
I don't understand it.
"It took nine of us to lift it, we've taken two of the three coffin lids off, yet the whole thing still weighs a ton."
- Mummy must be made of lead.
- HOWARD:
Here's your answer.
The first two coffins were made of wood covered in gold foil.
The third coffin isn't wood.
It's solid gold.
And they said this might not be a royal tomb.
There is one thing that's bothering me.
Look at Harry's photographs.
The physiognomy of the second coffin is completely different from the other two.
Mace always said these shrines were botched up.
I think this one was made for someone else.
I think they buried our friend in a hurry.
"And I think it's time we had a look, don't you?"
HOWARD:
Ready?
Lift.
(Grunting)
"Pecky, tell me when you have it."
PECKY:
I'll take it now.
"Behind me, behind me, go behind me."
Behind me.
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was- stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Inconfinencen.
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
Here.
"-Rodney, I'm going to cry."
"-No, and don't say anything silly."
"Betty, you know how glad I am that I married you?"
"Oh, Rodney, I hope so!"
Your dad is over there.
Go say good-bye to him.
"Go on, go say good-bye to him."
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.
Take care of yourself.
"And, whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Say, do me a favor, dad."
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask you, but she might need it."
-I'll keep an eye on her.
-The draftees assemble over here.
Come right in close.
"Now... as chairman of the Draft Board, let me say that all of us regret... having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
"Please, try to come back safely to your homes."
We've prepared some gift packages.
"Step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees, in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
"Hubba, hubba, hubba!"
"Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the good-byes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
"You do that a lot with your passengers, do you?"
No.
But I've driven Kelly home before.
So you are on first-name terms?
She booked the cab in her name.
You see anything suspicious?
Anyone outside her flat?
Nah.
Not that I recall.
You went straight to your next pick-up?
"Yeah, in Bermondsey."
Is she all right?
Kelly Mahon is dead.
You're joking?
No.
OK.
We might need to speak to you again.
What do you reckon?
Should get Ange to run some background on him just in case.
I reckon we should go and speak to Kelly Mahon's fiance.
I was working late and...
crashing in the office.
"You do that often, sleep at work?"
No.
We just got this big client.
I was under pressure to get their accounts finished.
That's where Kelly and I met.
My firm do the accounts for the lab.
Kelly didn't mind you staying out all night?
She would have ended up crashing at Chloe's talking flowers.
Someone can verify you staying at your work?
I dunno.
He's at Rocky Point.
I oughta know that.
Hanley and Grayce got him picked up for an old rat and sent there to get him outta the way because the papers was getting hot.
It's like having him put in a safe.
Yeah.
That's all I know.
You can't blame me.
In Rocky Point.
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.
So now what?
"So, what do you suppose?"
"I promised the girl we'd find that fink and clear Ross, didn't I?"
"Well, we did."
Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
Is that right?
Duck soup.
"You take off the kelly at the front door and say,"
"""Please, sir, can I see Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"""
It's too hot.
And supposin' we do find the guy?
Where's the payoff?
"Yeah, the payoff."
"Why don't you forget it, Stacey?"
What difference does it make if you promised the girl?
What do you care about Ross?
We can't help it if Polecat's in stir.
We'll just fool around at Rocky Point and get paid off with a slug in the belly.
And I ain't taking it for Ross or nobody.
Okay.
"If there was only a half a chance, Stacey."
"Listen, don't do nothing foolish."
Of course I'm sure.
The mayor's wife left a letter.
"Wait, what about the film?"
You promise me you'll destroy it?
"Previously on ""Death Comes to Town"":"
That's a brooch?
And why do we need a camera again?
For my investigation.
"Marnie, I need to know who really killed the Mayor."
"But if Shuckton is going to continue to grow or even survive, we need to bring in some new money."
What's that?
You want a kiss?
"Well, if that's what you want."
"Oh yeah, Shuckton, I still got it."
I'm your soul taker!
I got it.
Two for two.
I got two souls.
I'm your man.
"Oh yeah, I still got- Ahhhh!"
Ohhh.
Shit.
"And now the sad, freaking news."
It appears that one of our own has become the story.
"Heather Weather was killed yesterday, which leaves us to wonder, who could have killed this aging bright light."
"What, you don't like the picture?"
I picked it out myself.
"Ma'am, can I talk to you for a minute?"
I've live on the air here.
We have some questions regarding your involvement in the case that you're reporting.
Levon!
I forgot to post the invites.
Dinner is served.
-
- Last few what at the old price?
-
- W--Worry about that when we get 'em inside!
-
"- We need a bigger window, you know."
-
- What for?
So we can write bigger letters.
I doubt if they can read that across the street.
All this m--money I'm spending on advertising!
I'm n--not r--r--reaching p--people.
All this money?
What money?
One little brush and a pot of whitewash!
"Do you want to cross the road, love?"
Off we go!
It's all clear.
"How about a kiss, then, to start the day right?"
"It might start your flaming' day right, but it won't do a lot for me!"
I see you've just met Dennis.
That's Dennis.
We're training him for a round of his own.
I hope it's not round here!
Thank God it's dark.
Suppose somebody had seen me kissing the milkman!
Some of these firms spend a lot of m--money on advertising.
That's it.
"If it's gonna cost money, that's us finished before we start!"
You're okay with me doing this?
That's what you came here for.
Who is he?
Takenaka San from Planet Music Japan.
Sleeping your way up?
Why are you working here?
I thought you were at Grand Pacific.
You've been lying to me.
I wasn't lying to you.
After the tsunami I couldn't pay tuition.
I graduated thanks to 1.4 million from your parents.
How could I tell you I didn't get that job?
Then return the money.
You said we'd merge our finances anyway.
Maybe not.
Maybe I need to rethink marrying a whore.
"""Sorry, I was trying to turn you into a delivery girl."""
"""But you made me want to go straight."
"I promise I'll be back!"""
Yes?
"If you're staying, you'll need to pay the overnight fee."
Why?
Your companion left.
He'll be back.
- But...
- I promise he'll be back.
"Could you contact him, then?"
What?
Call his cell.
Don't have his number?
"I have his email, I'll email him."
He's not coming back.
"Yeah, that's what I'm doin'."
"Uh, where's the powder room?"
He ain't got one of them.
My bathroom is right through there.
Thanks.
"Rick, I want you to check a... a light blue sedan for me."
License number 5567 A.
It's a... a government vehicle or a rental.
"And the driver, well, he's, uh, early 20s, blond..."
"Yeah, government type."
Yeah.
"Uh, thanks."
What are you doing?
The Iron Man contest.
"Oh, no, T.C."
No way.
I told you.
I am not entering that.
Don't start again.
Not even to save Island Hoppers?
"I mean, I figure what I need is better promotion, better advertising."
"What could be better than to have the company name... in front of the public in a big, fancy..."
"Oh, I see."
You're entering the race.
Did I hear somebody mention a race?
"Oh, yeah."
It's the Iron Man.
It's a big event with men and women if you're into competitive suicide.
"See, first you swim five miles in rough water."
Then you run a complete 26 mile marathon.
"Then, finally, the people who are still alive, they bicycle a hundred miles."
T.C. here is gonna enter.
[Man] A penny for your thoughts.
I'm thinking about the - the store we had - about your father.
- Yeah?
- But I don't remember him very well.
I remember you were a little boy... and you printed your name on the sidewalk.
"- Yeah, I did that."
- I remember that.
We used to keep the store open till 12:00 at night.
"Well, that was many, many years ago."
"Well, your father was still doing it."
But he stopped doing it.
He stopped doing that about 10 years before you sold it.
And Goodman or Goldman - What was his name?
He used to come around.
He
- He lost his business.
- I don't know.
- His son broke up his business.
- Hmm.
I don't remember that.
- He used to come every night and talk to your- to your father  [Coughs]
- After we closed the store.
- Yeah?
- They used to sit down and talk.
I don't know who you're talking about.
"- Well, you don't remember."
I remember.
- I don't remember.
"""Goldman"" or ""Goodman"" was his name."
Don't remember that story.
Do you remember working in real estate?
"Oh, yeah."
Let me do that.
It'II be faster and simple.
-I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
-What are those underneath?
Those are love letters yellowing with antiquity...
-...all from one boy.
Give those back.
-I'm just gonna have a look.
-The touch of your hands insults them.
"-Now, don't pull that stuff."
"Now that you've touched them, I'II burn them."
What are they?
Poems a dead boy wrote.
I hurt him the way that you would Iike to hurt me.
But you can't.
"I'm not young and vulnerable anymore, but my young husband was, and I...."
Never mind about that.
Just give them back to me.
Thank you.
What'd you mean by saying you have to burn them up?
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my head for a moment.
Everyone has something they won't let others touch because of their--
Their intimate nature.
AmbIer and AmbIer.
Crabtree.
-More AmbIer and AmbIer.
-What's AmbIer and AmbIer?
A firm that made loans on the place.
-It was lost on a mortgage.
-That must have been what happened.
"I don't want if, ands or buts."
Stage three.
How long do we stay there?
Two days at the most.
Then we go to four.
"Well, what I wanna know..."
"Would you make a note of this, Cathy?"
What I wanna know is do we really need this set?
"Excuse me, sir."
I don't wanna interrupt you.
Is that the shark from Jaws?
"Yeah, I believe it is, Lieutenant."
That's the one that they used in the picture?
I think so.
"Well, that looks different to me."
I can't help that.
If we do scene 31 on stage four...
Could they have two?
I...
"You know, because in the picture..."
Lieutenant...
"...at the end, it got all mangled."
"Lieutenant, I know you didn't come here to talk about sharks."
I'm pressed for time.
What do you want?
"Well, I just wanted to ask a couple questions..."
We got wardrobe in five minutes.
I can give you two minutes.
Fine.
Thank you very much.
"I understand, sir, that you and your wife were living apart."
"That's true, Lieutenant."
We haven't been close for some time now.
That's great.
This-- this is nothing.
I hope not.
This is unexpected.
"Yes, well, uh, turns out that Bill is gonna have to work late again."
Oh?
"Uh, so, we won't be able to use these ballet tickets, which is why I'm giving them to you and Stephanie."
"Well, that's, uh-- that's very thoughtful of you."
"Well, I can see the two of you are really hitting it off, and since I feel I had some hand in this,"
"- and, uh--"
- Wait.
You were watching us?
"No, I--"
"I was just getting the mail, Paul."
I can't help it if Stephanie's laugh travels like a hyena's.
Your friend Stephanie.
"All I'm saying is, uh, please take the tickets."
I will.
"And, uh, I better call Stephanie right away, see if she's available."
So... cross your fingers for us.
Fingers crossed.
Enjoy the evening.
We will.
Oh.
You're home.
As usual.
"I supposed you want dinner, as well."
"I, uh, haven't even given it a thought."
Where-- where have you been?
I was just next door offering Paul our ballet tickets.
"Uh, well, it turns out he's dating someone."
Stephanie.
I can't.
Why not?
"It was, it was pouring rain."
I could barely see out the window.
The car started to skid.
"I don't know, I saw the wall coming and I didn't stop, I just kept driving."
"What are you saying, Judy?"
What happened?
I didn't know that Grace's car seat wasn't clicked in.
I would never do anything to hurt my child.
Did you do this on purpose?
Sometimes I...
I can't help it.
"Sometimes, it's like I don't know how to snap out of it."
It's like... everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
"Judy, did you try to hurt yourself?"
I just wanted it to stop.
- Do either of you have a moment?
- Shoot.
I think my MVC mom's suffering from severe postpartum depression.
- Just one second.
- It's the baby.
Grace Anderson.
- What about her?
- She's waking up.
I thought you might want to extubate.r.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
What are her symptoms?
She drove head-on to a wall with her baby in the car.
I think it was intentional.
I'd like to put her on psych hold.
- Dr. Rasgotra?
There are bills to be paid.
Take a check from the drawer and pay at the bank.
There's a checkbook with signed checks.
Alright.
"Do it by tomorrow, otherwise there'll be a fine."
Okay.
And sell some of the short-term deposit at the bank.
Tell Yaffa she promised me higher interest.
I'll handle everything.
Did you move all yourthings?
How's the apartment?
I brought everything back home.
Why?
Daddy...
Come on...
I brought yourthings from home and the play from your nightstand.
Do you need anything else?
I don't need anything.
What'll you do with the contract?
It's a waste if you pay and don't live there.
I feel bad about all this.
I ran out of licorice.
Okay.
I'll relieve you.
"Hello, Mr. Director."
"Once again, you took things to heart."
"I'm going, will you be alright?"
Of course.
"Goodbye, my child."
I'll be back later.
Those dancers don't have a contract?
"Sorry, I don't work like that."
Tiny Eyes!
I think revenge is a dish best served flaming.
Why did you do that?
It was such a cool line.
"The other day, you mentioned your Saint Bernards."
"You had two, I believe."
What were their names?
I don't think we ever got around to naming them.
Dusty and Bear?
I thought Dustybear Financial had an odd ring to it.
You made it up.
Roger didn't get me fired.
And he didn't derail my mayorship.
"I did, by being a sucky mayor."
"The jig is up, sweetheart."
"You baited me with an old newspaper, cooked up this plan, then ran me around on a wild-goose chase."
Why?
"You were so down, and I-"
- I wanted to get that spark back.
What better way than blowing up someone's office?
But does it spoil all the fun we had to know I made it all up?
The fact that you made all this up for me is so much better than any revenge.
- Boom.
- [ Chuckles ]
Listen up.
"So, Roger didn't fire you..."
but he is a total d-bag.
"Yeah, tremendous d-bag."
Shall we?
Let's.
Come on.
Hey!
And he's very blunt with Da Ran too...
Right?
"-You felt that too, right?"
-Yes!
That's why I was so happy!
He must finally feel comfortable with our family!
"Now it really feels like, he's become our son-in-law, so I'm so very happy!"
Well...
If it's because he's become comfortable....
It's a relief then.
It worked.
"Hurry, hurry."
Hurry up and come in.
Does our Yoon Jae live by himself too?
His parents are overseas.
Don't carelessly touch random stuff!
Let's quickly pack up what we need.
I told you not to touch things!
Come here.
The clothes are in here.
Pack up a few things to wear from here.
Oh my goodness!
You scared me!
How can you...be undressed like that!
Why are you surprised when it's something that you probably see all the time?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why steal glances when you see it all the time?
"Here, just look."
I haven't seen it!
What's wrong with you?
"When I was completely naked in the hospital, you ran over and hugged me."
"'Yoon Jae, I thought you were dead!"
It's over.
"Oh, and, Nina, it's not me, it's you."
Ladies ofthe Hub... why do we try to act like we have no needs?
I have needs.
"For instance, I need a date for Saturday night."
Any takers?
"You, blondie."
"You there, with the glasses."
What about the redhead trying to cover her face?
"12,378, here I come."
Hey.
So I went to see Jake Bradley-
You mean- [Imitating Eric] Jake Bradley?
Yes.
To see if he wanted to hang out.
And you know what Mr. Cool Guy was doing?
Just hanging out in his basement with his friends... and they were watching The Six Million Dollar Man.
It was eerie.
Was there a skinny guy dating this really hot chick... who's way out of his league?
"You know, there was."
Wait.
Does this mean we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?
"No, man."
We don't need anyone else.
You know what?
We've only got two months until graduation... and we can't waste a second of that.
Forman's right.
"Let's seize the day, man."
"Hey, weren't we supposed to seize something, man?"
You know what the Six Million Dollar Man should have?
A bionic nose.
You could smell everything!
I know that crowd.
Watch out or they'll get him into trouble.
You understand?
"Tomorrow evening, you say?"
Is Biberkopf really coming with us?
Of course.
Why not?
"One bale of cheviot, 75.29."
"One half bale of worsted, 75.64."
"One bale of cheviot, 75.66."
- How many bales are missing in total?
- Just a moment.
"My wife said just yesterday, ""No one can get through that door!"""
So they came through the roof!
- The very best English cloth!
These men clearly have no sense of patriotism!
The very best English cloth!
The very best English cloth.
"I certainly hope so, or I'm conning myself."
That tickles!
No nonsense!
I'll send for my old things later.
"Mieze, come and be amazed."
What do you think?
- Very smart!
Clothes make the man.
Now it's your turn.
No!
Don't be so silly!
Business is good.
We can afford decent clothes now.
Right?
Okay.
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Okay, see you later."
Bye.
Good evening and welcome to The Bombay.
The next song is one of my favourites.
I hope you like it.
And now a song dedicated to La Loba.
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is our spirit and our wives, right?"
She applies the real ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need it, you have to, pay look, I like it, I want it, buy it and fuck you."
You can't do anything about it.
And when we get home tired and ask:
How did it go?
"How was your day, honey?"
They are always grouchy and reply:
Do you really want to know?
No man!
It's hard to deal with them every day.
But that's how it is.
We have to learn to live with it.
"Don't you think so, Miss?"
"Hey, Beto!"
"- Hello, beautiful!"
I don't get it.
You live in this mansion and we have to fuck in this room.
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they're terrific."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
Legs are not important.
- Why not?
There is a bottle in the fridge.
There's sippy cups.
Don't give her any juice though.
Only water.
"And, well, you know where the diapers are, so... well, you really should use those organic disposable kinds because they're better for the environment."
"Well, here you go!"
"Thank you, honey."
You are the best friend ever.
"- Well, thank you."
- For what?
For believing in me.
"You coulda hired a babysitter, but you didn't."
"Oh, it's okay, bubba."
Bye-bye!
Okay.
What does she like to play with?
"Uh, mostly Tupperware."
I can't believe you did that.
- What?
Adam?
- Yeah.
"I gave him the ticket as payment to look at the contract, which he did, by the way."
"Okay, you know what?"
Whatever.
"I was hoping that you guys would get back together, and just put everybody out of your misery."
"- But I'm guessing it didn't work, huh?"
- Just drop it.
"We need to focus on this interview, and I swear to God, if I hear the name ""Adam"" one more time, I'm gonna--"
Hey.
I'm Adam.
"What, are you the... doughnut guy?"
"No, dude."
"- This way, Mrs Dashwood."
- My dear Colonel.
- I found your mother starting out herself.
She had determined to come on her own account.
- Mama!
"- Oh, my love!"
My love!
Thank God.
"Oh, thank the dear Lord who has given you back to me."
"Oh, I was so frightened."
"I had no news, you see."
I expected you home and you had not come.
Let me look at you.
"Oh, how thin you are."
"Well, I shall feed you up."
You will have all your favourite things.
"I am very thirsty, Mama."
We must let her rest.
She is still very weak.
"You go to sleep now, Marianne."
Mama is with you.
She will not go away.
"You need sleep too, my dear."
I can see that.
This is my place now.
"Colonel, I cannot find words to acknowledge what we owe to you, or to thank you adequately."
The glimpse I had of your sister is sufficient thanks... not that I need any.
"If ever a man deserved his heart's desire, it is you, Colonel."
"At last, we are alone."
"Oh, my dear Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness."
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.
He told me so himself.
"Turn them over, George."
I wanna see them.
Come on.
I'm calling.
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!
"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you for me when in fact, it was an unauthorised hi."
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.
- You never said hi.
- Correct.
"- You still like me, don't you?"
- Correct.
What?
"Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day."
How can you say that I still like you when I didn't even say hi to you?
Coming down to say that you didn't say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi.
Jake...
The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
"- So, what was wrong with him?"
- Nothing.
He's been lying to me for two months?
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?
"There's one other person who might do something like this, and that's you."
- Well...
- I don't even think you could do it.
"No, I could do it."
"- Yeah, I guess you could."
- Come on.
Gil's been down at the nursing home with your mother.
"Obviously, they're gonna call you, but I said...."
"You know, I felt I should be the one to...."
I suppose we can't say we haven't been expecting it.
For some time now she'd been gradually winding down.
-And at least it was peaceful.
"-Oh, no."
I just wish we could've been there.
"So, what were her last words?"
Do you remember?
Her last words were....
"Actually, yes, I do."
She said the two of you deserved each other.
Ah.
"Anyway, I'll just, you know."
I'm just really sorry.
"So, what sort of fruit does he like on his cereal?"
Bananas?
He's not keen.
I know what you mean.
"There's always those long stringy bits down the side, aren't there, you can't bring yourself to eat."
Why is that?
"Oh, no."
God.
-What's happening?
-It's those two guys from school.
Gary and Jamie.
Oh?
They look nice.
"Yeah, except watch how they completely ignore me because I'm about as interesting to them as a fly."
Bet they don't even say hello.
"-Hey, Julie, you all right?"
I am a seagull.
"Since I'm here way, way and I think very intensely."
And I grow the forces of my soul.
"I know now, and understand, Kosta, that in our profession an actress or a writer,"
I'essenziale is not the glory or the splendor of which I dreamed.
But the main thing is knowing how to resist.
Learning to carry your cross and keep the faith.
Here the object is full.
So now we define the details.
"It is shocking, eh?"
They are conspiracy or what?
Our girlfriends ...
There is a doll ...
here is the head and feet here.
I put it upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes ..."
Fa 'see where his head.
And the walk?
And the sex?
"It's good, eh?"
Good one.
Give me a pleasure.
You can ask that illuminate the scene?
Desire a child ...
"Turn all the lights, quick!"
- Do as he says.
- Do not want to mica again?
You do not.
"You played, you have enjoyed."
I do what you had to ...
And you loved me?
I would bite.
- you should be sobbing about the fact that she took off with all your money.
- [sobbing]
- all right.
get ahold of yourself!
it's christmas eve!
look.
"you put in some long hours here, and you do some overtime -- heck, by the time you're 40..."
- [cries]
- there you are!
[giggles] of course i'll marry you.
why don't you just say so?
- really?
- yeah.
what the heck else am i gonna do?
- do you love me?
"- if wink wasn't here, i'd show you just how much."
- don't mind me.
"- but since he is, i'm just gonna take the minivan and i'm gonna get used to it."
"i'll see you back at home, okay?"
"- wink, please don't make him work too late."
"- [mockingly] no, i won't."
- [chuckles]
- see?
she does love me!
- get off!
"for as bright as you are, you are as dumb as a bag of hammers -- dumb, dumb, dumb!"
- oh.
[sighs] dang it.
- [echoing] you looking for this?
"- oh, not now."
really?
[sighs]
"We have, like, 8000 undocumented workers here daily."
"Okay, and you find an ashtray with cigarettes in it and you think..."
You automatically assume that they're mine.
"Oh, yeah."
"Honey, I'm not lying to you."
I think you are really freaking out.
This whole renovation thing's getting to you because nothing's happening.
Just say no.
Get it out.
Gonna take a shower.
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Who'd have thought that a random girl from yoga would fix me up with such a good kisser?
"- Back at you, sister."
I can't wait to kiss you again.
But we're kissing right now.
"I know, next time."
The second-date kiss is way more intimate.
"Well, listen I'm leaving tomorrow, so I'll be out of touch for a little bit."
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.
Okay.
[PHONE RINGING]
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah?
"Hey, sorry to bug you again."
Quick question.
"Excuse me one minute, babe."
Sorry.
What's going on?
From the programme.
Tubby Baker.
"Very pleased to meet you, Pauline."
"Oh, don't be."
I'm only a lowly secretary.
Enid is the PA.
She has the desk planner and the intercom.
And what have I got?
Some Handy Andies and a plastic lemon.
We're on lemon and hot water.
"I told you, we're slimming."
How's it going?
This week?
Not great.
"I can have 7,000 calories a week, and, so far, I've had 3,800 and it's only Tuesday, but, hey, two days on potted meat and water biscuits."
That could level me back off.
"Speaking of chips, where are you taking her?"
You're not escorting her to lunch?
Of course!
"Pauline, it's Tuesday!"
I was thinking of having a sandwich.
Can I interest you in sitting on a bench?
In the square?
No.
I don't have time.
"No, fair enough."
"Well, I won't clog up the mighty wheels of commerce."
"Very pleased to have met you, Pauline."
"Enid's got a lot more leeway than me calorie-wise, she can have a jacket potato and a yoghurt."
I don't think I've ever had a yoghurt.
"No, you don't look like you've ever had one."
No offence.
"Cool, right?"
Are you for real?
Are you blind?
Or am I invisible?
There's no money here!
"If that bothers you, you're welcome to leave."
"Calm down, Franz."
I see how you are  and I like what I see.
"Here, Jesus and the merchants."
It's all in there.
- Only no one understands it anymore.
- It's a culturally useless artifact.
It's quite heavy.
Shall I quickly summarize it?
"I can read, thank you."
"Jesus enters the temple, it's filled with merchants..."
"He flips the tables over, and says:"
"My house shall be a place of worship, but you've turned it into death pit."
"Okay, you want to attract more guests, right?"
"Generally, yes."
But who would want to come here?
Let me worry about that for now.
Do you two need a priest now or what?
Who's that?
- That is a man in a monkey mask.
I thought so.
What does he want?
Hannes is a television producer.
"Yes, but what is he doing here?"
He's interested in this place.
Is he also interested in us?
"- Yes, he is."
It's right under your nose.
Vadim.
You let me know the second you find these guys.
Copy that.
Somebody please shut the alarm off!
I got work to do.
Motts.
Take Bobby's place in Air Comm.
I'll show you the way.
We got some important people waiting for us.
"- Are you okay, sir?"
- I'm all right.
- Is your family in the complex?
- They won't be here till tonight.
"- Your daughter, where's your daughter?"
- I couldn't find her.
I hope she got out.
Do you know these men?
"That old son of a bitch, his name is Martin Walker."
He's the head of my Secret Service.
You should have a conversation about how serious you take your protection.
- I didn't pick him.
- Why is he doing this?
I think it has something to do with his son Kevin.
- Why?
What happened?
- He was a Marine.
He got killed last year in this covert action that I ordered.
Would he do this for a personal vendetta?
He said he wanted you alive.
There's gotta be a bigger play.
We gotta get out of this elevator shaft.
Why am I in this filthy place eating cup noodles?
"Listen, Kim, I'm not the kind of person who belongs here."
Where do you belong?
Know the Grand Pacific?
It's a 5 star hotel.
No?
I worked there.
"Some stuff happened and I'm sort of stuck here for now, but I'll be back working at a first class hotel."
"This is just a temporary gig, you understand?"
Temporary?
Know that word?
"Room 307, vacating."
"They're out, can you go clean?"
Do it in 20 minutes.
Boss scolds me for slow turnaround.
Where's Suzuki San?
I saw her by the fire escape.
"No, no, no!"
"Don't go return it, we can just pay the late fee."
"You can't go out, okay?"
"Please, just don't."
I'll go return it later.
Okay?
"No, you can't!"
You hear?
What're you doing out here?
I need you on cleaning duty.
Right.
Here for bill collection.
What did Suzuki San do before coming here?
People who end up at places like this have their reasons.
It'd be wise to not pry too much.
I'll be damned.
"So, that's what happened."
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
I have this incredible house because it makes a statement about who I am.
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
"It says, I am a force to be reckoned with."
What you are Vic?
You know it's time you stop jacking off and started making a serious commitment.
"Not to just carmine, but to this family."
"And the rust and most important step in doing that is to, stop thinking about what you need and start talking about what you want."
"Well, I want respect."
"Well, I want respect."
You want respect?
You take out tendo.
You put him out of business.
I don't care how you do it.
He'll have all the respect you need.
And then we'll talk about the house.

Hi.
Hi there yuko.
Shuji!
So happy you could make it.
"Well, my client insisted."
Yuko said she needed to know more about me.
I'm kinds of helping her do her job.
Good idea.
"Hi, yuko."
"Hi, aja."
Speaking Japanese
I'm so happy to see you again.
"Nick, this is aja."
She is my manager here.
Hello.
Terrible lie

"Hey God, i really don't know what you mean."
Seems like salvation comes only in my dreams.
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
"Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems."

Don't tear it away from me.

"I lost my ignorance, security and pride"
I'm all alone in this fucking world you must despise
"Hey God,"
...and squeeze the life out of you for what you've done because you're a scumbag and I hate you.
And you're out of order!
Don't ever think you can come back into my life and do it again!
All right?
"Hi, there."
I'm looking for a car seat.
What type are you looking for?
It's a silver Audi with a black leather interior and a metallic trim.
I don't know.
Cheapest.
What do most people get?
Not necessarily the cheapest.
Parents are usually worried about safety.
"Oh, yeah."
"There's not much point in saving a few quid if they end up through the windscreen, is there?"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's a cool one.
"Even if you get a cool one the kids will mess them all up, anyway."
What with their sweets and all that.
Right.
Yeah.
"So, what's this song then?"
"If you live off of it, we must've heard of it."
"It's ""Santa's Super Sleigh""."
## Look who's coming round the bend #
# It's Santa and his reindeer friends #
"# With a ho, ho, ho and a hey, hey, hey #"
# It's Santa's super sleigh ##
I expect people do that all the time.
"No, I think you two are the first."
Sorry.
"Sometimes, when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it."
"""This is not a dream."""
"Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz."
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy."
"I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal and then a live show."
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
"If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
"If I meet with Tracy Jordan and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
I'm known for being reasonable.
[Sighs]
Okay.
"Alfredo, 2:00 P. M."
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?
"Pete, hang back for me."
"Yeah, you bet."
"Y'all, please set yourselves for ""Dr. Ridiculous."""
Hey.
What happened to your head?
The sky is falling.
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that cat-lady sketch, do I have to hold a real cat?"
Cat-lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"As for the DNA findings,"
Didn't you know this kid?
Weren't you there that day?
He was a brother of a friend of mine.
I don't intend to let that cloud my judgement.
I'm gonna deal with this case like I deal with any other: professionally.
"Alright, the murder weapon..."
Daddy!
I need to tell you something.
Right now ?
"No, mom, tomorrow night."
"Now, of course now."
And this is ?
"We were married for 23 years, Mark."
You both need to hear this.
"I told you, didn't I?"
I told you I knew he was alive.
It's a mistake...
It's a mistake.
"It's been checked, it's DNA."
It's a mistake !
Alan!
Accept it.
What accept that he's alive ?
Give myself that hope only to have it dragged away again?
- We are gonna get our boy back.
- I would give anything... anything to put my arms around my son again.
"But what is this, where does this leave us?"
Just like when he went:
with a million of questions and no bloody answers.
"Alan, Alan don't walk away."
- I can't do this again.
"Learn your duties, obey orders and no harm will come to you."
"Remember, the only enemy is the Frenchman."
"Read these men the Articles of War, they are compulsorily enlisted."
"Now, you may proceed with your other duties."
"Thank you, sir."
Muster on the forecastle.
I'll read the Articles.
Turn forward and follow me.
Get them moving!
Use your starter!
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Jump to it, you swabs!"
Anchors aweigh!
Up aloft there.
Come on.
"Look lively, lads."
Next!
Next!
Set the foresail.
Give her the mainsail.
Lift the jib!
Full speed!
"- Don't look down, swab!"
"- Keep them moving, damn your eyes!"
"Go higher, you scum!"
Last man down sent for punishment!
Get them moving there!
"Come on, there."
Jump to it!
"Come on, jump to it!"
That's not good enough.
We'll do it again.
Thank you.
And you're pretty pretty.
Thank you.
"Well, there are some people dying, so we should..."
I have a meeting to get to.
"I'll see you later, Sara."
"Hope to hear from you soon, Riley."
Awesome.
"Okay, this is not good."
This is not good.
This is totally weird.
- What's weird?
- You.
Going out with Dr. Lonsdale.
That guy's my hero.
My roommate can't date my hero.
Just like you can't date my dentist.
Remember that?
"So, I haven't heard from Riley in a month now."
Shouldn't I have some sort of anesthetic?
Please.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
"I mean, it's not like I'm going to embarrass you or anything."
"What, you think I'm going to embarrass you?"
It's a strong possibility.
"Well, I will have you know that I have dated congressmen."
And two hockey players.
I think I can hold my own with a measly doctor.
Where are you getting all these good dates?
Bam.
"Oh, hey, you remember Noah from our flag football team?"
Yeah.
"All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."
Terry feels like a whore.
"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
"Great, Hitchcock's in."
Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"Yeah, about that."
"Um, there were no tickets left."
"But I brought my minivan, so..."
Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
"Needles, needles, need... whoa!"
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right.
This is gonna hurt.
You better tell me the truth.
Give me the knife.
"Frankie, give me the knife!"
What are you doing?
Slit your wrists and let Stella come and find you?
- Give me a chance to talk about it.
"- Tell me, are you fucking her?"
- No.
It's over.
- I'll kill her if you're lying to me.
"It's okay, honey."
"It's okay, honey."
There's nothing going on here.
"Go on downstairs, OK?"
"You heard me, right?"
Deal with it!
How are you?
All right.
Did Immigration tell you why you were picked up?
They said they are investigating Katarina's escort service.
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.
I am still waiting on a lawyer.
Good.
I am supposed to be travelling tomorrow and I haven't spoken to George all day.
He is going to wonder what happened to me.
I'm not gonna let you go.
Unless you sign this...
"Go ahead, read it."
- What is it?
"- It's your contract, to work for me as an agent at CSIS."
"It's not the same as being a confidential informant, which is what you've been doing so far."
Let's call it a day.
I can still—
Hey...
Tohsaka!
Can't you see that Archer is acting strange?
we need to be on the same page.
I get it!
I'll go home.
I'll do as you say and go home.
then.
and good work today.
I was able to see you as a Master.
Archer!
we'll get to the bottom of this screw-up!
there it is.
The uncharacteristic lack of verbal abuse was troubling me.
look here...
Am I going to have to lay down the law?
You want to sleep in my room?
Of course.
To prevent a repeat of last night's error
I shall sleep in your room.
Surely you have no objections?
I do!
Big ones!
When it comes down to it it's your fault for falling victim to remote hypnosis from such a great distance.
I cannot protect you from Caster's magic so it's natural that I at least stay in the same room.
that's a perfectly sound argument.
tonight—
All right.
I'll have you sleep nearby.
Good.
We just proved that she didn't shoot herself.
"Come on, Melvin."
"If she committed suicide, the gun would have been down there."
It's not.
So someone shot her.
"Damn it, Melvin."
Will you give it up?
You've got no evidence and no motive.
She was pregnant.
Pregnant?
That's right.
And we both know who the father was.
[ Laughs ] [ Groans ]
"Oh, come on, Greg."
"Ah, I'm just a little off today."
"Hey, Melvin, Lyle."
"Can you believe it, Melvin?"
First time I beat the kid since he was 1 6.
Must be the cold.
[ Chuckles ]
I've got your check up at the office.
Looks like we'll have snow for the funeral.
I can't bury her until I finish the investigation.
Melvin thinks she was murdered.
Murdered?
You said she committed suicide.
"No, I found a bullet hole in her left temple right here."
So the poor kid shot herself.
Why would anybody want to kill Hilla?
Maybe because she was pregnant.
"Of course, that probably doesn't come as any big news to you, does it, Greg?"
How did he know she was telling the truth?
"Well, um, we're meeting for breakfast."
"So, maybe we'll get into some of that."
It just seems a little strange that he's suddenly here now.
"Yeah, I get that, but come on, you remember how good he was before he left, right?"
I'm just...
I'm trying to focus on that. (CHUCKLES)
"Mmm... actually, I kinda remember him being a little off."
He wasn't off.
"What do you mean ""off""?"
"He was damaged, Emma."
"I wouldn't have used that word when we were little, but he was damaged."
- When Brandon James killed all of his...
"- He went through a lot, okay?"
We should definitely be able to understand that.
And maybe he's better now.
People can recover.
"Em, he just left you without any explanation."
What about that?
You should be careful.
Yeah.
"Okay, I shouldn't have called you."
"- Wait, are you pissed at me?"
"- Um, I'll see you later."
"(KNOCKING) Hey, sleepyhead!"
I've been texting you since dawn.
Ready to check the storage unit?
"Let's go, go, go!"
"Yeah, just give me one sec, okay?"
One second.
Meet me out front.
Thank you.
"This place is, uh, nice."
* When you are mine
(CLEARING THROAT)
"Hello, Aunt Nancy."
"Hello, Willy."
Why aren't you inside dancing?
"Oh, I am dancing inside."
"I mean, inside I'm dancing."
I know what you mean.
That's very grown-up.
"Uh, can I ask you a question?"
"That's ungrammatical, but tonight's a holiday."
What is it?
"Well, do you believe in love at first sight?"
"Willy, you've fallen in love with one of the girls here, haven't you?"
Uh-huh.
"Does she love you, too?"
"Well, she's very fond of me, and she thinks I have a very fine and sensitive spirit."
So do I.
You tell her I said you'd make a fine husband when the time comes.
I think the time's coming.
"Nancy, I think you're the most wonderful girl"
"I ever met in my whole life, and I haven't slept a wink since I kissed you."
"Willy, little boys don't talk like that."
"Yes, I know, and I never could talk to girls."
"I mean, I usually get very tongue-tied when I'm around girls."
But not when I'm around you.
That's very sweet.
"I'm very grateful, but..."
"Willy, I'm too old for you."
My mom and dad got married when she was 17.
"Yes, that's different."
That's old enough for a girl to get married.
You need to be home where you're safe.
You could chain me to this porch and I'd still never touch you like that again.
I got off the phone with Mrs. Potter's housekeeper.
Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.
Paige?
"I'm sorry, Emily."
I wanted you to know that.
- I think maybe you're being framed.
- What changed your mind?
I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me.
So this is what a real date with Ezra Fitz looks like.
Lead the way.
I gave your mom the museum ticket.
- Why would you do that?
"- A has something on me, and..."
"A has something on all of us, Hanna."
"Okay, so your sister's pregnant."
How'd that happen?
I figure pretty much the usual way.
"It's not really a ""how"" question, it's more of a ""why"" question."
"Well, I mean, I guess Melissa could have gone all maternal but I doubt it."
"Ugh, this is so creepy."
Where are they now?
Philadelphia.
Shopping.
What do you think this means?
"I don't know, but Toby wanted us to have it."
There.
"It's in Braille, so..."
"- You want to see this, Aria?"
- No.
I can see just fine from here.
[door closes]
"- so, are we done?"
- almost.
- well [chuckles] there ain't nothing here at the dollar king that i don't know about.
- are you sure about that?
"'cause if you're sure about that, i'll make you a wager."
"- oh, yeah?"
and what do i get if i win?
- i'll leave you alone.
- hmm.
"and what do you get if you win, which you won't, but what do you get?"
"- you get cleaning supplies, and you clean up your mom's old salon."
- that's it?
just clean up her salon and not actually work there?
- that's up to you.
- deal. [spits]
"well, if you don't shake, then how are you gonna know i'm not gonna keep my word?"
- i trust you wouldn't break your word with the one and only constantine.
- you're probably right.
i probably won't. [chuckles]
see?
i knew harley skipped school!
[sighs]
- maybe he was lying.
- lying?
harley don't lie to me.
- take a closer look and think really hard.
- okay.
- it's christmastime.
school is out.
it's 9:00 p.m. at night.
- wow.
"Oh, I don't know if anything can make me feel any better."
I'm just so sad that it's come to this.
"Well, I got a little someone coming who's gonna make you feel real good."
"- Hey, what did you do?"
"- No, I didn't do him, but Colleen can."
Did you get me a prostitute?
What?
No. (scoffs)
What do you take me for?
"No, he's a dancer."
Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
"HEATHER: (gasps) Oh, this is perfect."
"Yeah, it's gonna be good."
"This could be just the thing that makes Matt jealous, that he'll just come running-man back to you."
Jealous?
"- Yeah, jealous."
- Yes.
"You guys haven't talked to Matt, have you?"
- No way.
- Hell no.
- Team Colleen.
- Hos before bros.
I broke up with him.
- What's that?
- Shut the front door.
You just said you missed him.
I do.
"Well, then why did you break up with him, Colleen?"
Because Matt's a great guy.
I got scared.
Matt fits into some really bad patterns in my family history.
By whom?
By Yagi.
By Takao.
You surprise me.
Isn't your husband in Kyoto?
But Takao might be watching for us.
That kid is his father's son.
He doesn't like ballet.
He wouldn't be at the theatre.
So everything is just fine with you?
I don't think that we're doing anything that should make us afraid of people.
I thought that someone was watching us the whole time.
It sounds like you're getting hysterical.
Maybe.
I shouldn't be seeing you.
"This place has changed a lot, too, hasn't it?"
"During the war, Takao and Shinako used to come here to get grass and dirt."
"When they came home, Yagi used to clean them off."
Yagi was like that back then.
Let's not talk about Yagi.
Shall we go to Ginza to get something to eat?
I said I'd meet Shinako at 6:00.
She's coming back from her performance in Sendai.
Wouldn't it be alright if I came along to meet Shinako?
I'll see you some other time.
It's difficult for me to be with you today.
Come in!
Is my mother here?
"Yes, she's waiting upstairs."
Mother?
Welcome back.
Sorry I'm late.
- Seth.
You're in my room.
- Yeah.
- How'd you get in here?
"- I, uh, took a left at the grotto, and I hopped the funicular to the dumbwaiter."
This is a... nic
"- So, what are you doing in here?"
"- Well, when I have a problem, Marissa, I like to talk about it incessantly."
"Yeah, no, that's it."
"I just think I burned out anyone else who will listen, so..."
- Is now a bad time?
- I'm game.
So...
"I think I really messed things up with Summer last night, hurt her pretty bad."
"- Yeah, you did."
"- Okay, not going to sugarcoat this one, huh?"
- Not for you.
"Look, if you really want to be her friend..."
then maybe you should think about just apologizing.
"- You know, say you were sorry."
"- Yeah, no, I know."
- Sounds so simple when you say it.
- I think that's a good place to start.
Okay.
"Uh, do you happen to know where Summer is right now?"
I just have this thing that I've got to tell her.
"- Yeah, she's at the club having lunch with her dad."
"- Oh, yeah, her father."
"Cool, well, I'm just going to, you know..."
"Whoa, Seth, you know what?"
Don't go there now.
"Just, uh, give her some space."
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
I couldn't have performed if I did.
"Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bro-nnection.
"All right, I got to know what she looks like-- show me a picture."
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Okay, here she is."
Okay.
Scrolling up.
"Oh, yeah, those are"
"""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
Uh-huh.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.
"Oh... gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
"Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face."
Mm-hmm.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone,"" am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"That's my sister, Ted!"
"Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you!"
This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York,"
"Ted, and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
"Please, continue to pack up."
Don't worry about us.
We have about 30 minutes left.
I'm... sorry.
I'll pay you back for the flyers.
- How... much is it?
"- It's probably around 30,000 won."
"Hey, give me 10,000 won."
"Kid, you should do your job right next time, okay?"
There are times when good guys get the short end of the stick.
But still...
I'm not really wasting my life away...
"Like Park Seon Woo said, am I?"
You're working very hard to clear the names of those wrongfully accused.
"This may be the time in your life, during which you shine the brightest."
Let's go.
"Oh, yes..."
He didn't show up?
He didn't call either?
I understand.
We will withdraw.
Yes.
The suspect must have had a change of heart.
- You got lucky this time.
- Yes.
Start being a decent citizen.
Hello.
"As I told you before, I found a good restaurant for you."
I'm thankful for your concern...
But I'll just stay here.
Mother...
If you continue to stay here...
Functional disorder in nature... and man.
I have to get through to people's hearts somehow.
"What is your heart telling you, Sire?"
The result of solar storm.
"Sire, all flights were cancelled."
"I know that, Carlos."
But there is a way.
What is it?
"Lili, stop it!"
I won't!
Take a look at yourself!
What is your problem?
That's a disgrace!
We have to try and be modern.
Modern?
"We are folk singers, after all."
So what?
It's the right thing to do!
"Come on, stop all that nonsense already!"
- I won't!
- What do you mean?
!
"Sire, I can't take responsibility for this mockery."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Please try to be more feminine.
That is pure madness!
"I agree, but the decision has been made."
There are no other options.
We take it or we leave it.
We can't neglect the protocol and security measures.
It's risky indeed.
There is always a risk.
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you'd get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love!
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
The One With The Birthing Video
How do you guys like living together?
-It's been good.
-Yeah.
-Except he's so uptight about crumbs.
-There was a drumstick in the couch.
I'm not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just, crumbs attract mice and mice leave droppings."
And that's how the plague started.
If you wanna relive that again... .
"Mice didn't start the plague, rats did."
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
"Oh, good God, Ross."
"In the parking lot over there, I have to walk a bit."
"All right, then."
"- It comes out to 18,400 won."
- Here.
"Out of 20,000 won, 1,600 won is your change."
"Thank you, good bye."
"Oh, hi."
Noona.
"I didn't want to make dinner, and we don't have any ramyun either."
- You're here?
- Yes.
I don't think we have any of those red bean donuts you like.
Anything is fine with me.
"Honey, pick a variety of ten, I'll pay for it."
Why are you passing over the sausage?
Stop butting in!
Idiot...
I haven't gotten to ten yet.
And what if you never get to ten?
"It's in the order of arrival, pick them in the order they arrived in!"
Really!
Don't even dream of having a husband who you're with all day.
"They go on about how we're such a beautiful couple, my life sucks."
"Thanks, Unni."
I'll be going.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
You don't need to come out!
Why are you coming out?
"Just because, I wanted to get some fresh air."
"You said you were going to take a break, when did you get here?"
I want you to put a guard on me.
"Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy."
- Right?
- Right.
So who's gonna watch me?
Cookie?
"No, not Cookie."
Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
"Okay, Price, you stay here."
What about Schulz?
We'll take care of Schulz.
Come on.
You too.
"That's a boy, Joey."
Play us a little something.
"What do you want to hear, Price, ""Home on the Range""?"
Or maybe a little Wagner?
"Or, uh, how about a game of pinochle?"
"No, you're not a pinochle man."
You're a chess player.
I never knew much about the game.
"Now, let's see a pawn moves this way and a bishop moves this way and the queen moves every which way, doesn't it?"
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
I went to school with a guy named Price.
That was in Boston.
"- You're from Cleveland, aren't you?"
"-Yeah, I'm from Cleveland."
I thought that's what you said.
You're from Cleveland.
"And you were with the, uh, 36th bomb group?"
Thirty-fifth.
The 366th bomb squadron out of Chelveston?
It's time you gave back to the community.
"If you want to help,"
You could contribute to ann's defense fund.
That's blackmail.
"Don't tell me the law,al."
Everything i said is legal.
"If you want to stay out of these cases,"
Quit screwing around.
He might have pardoned you... but your wife never will.
"Ron,tom, these are ann's parents."
Great.
"You haven't talked to the press,have you?"
"Ann,what have you gotten yourself into now?"
"I'm sorry,mom."
You should be.
This is why we didn't want you to go to college out here.
They remind me of my parents.
Mr. Diggs?
"Tom nicholson, from hastings,nebraska."
It's right near where you folks live.
We've just posted ann's bail.
"Listen, i'm sorry about all this,"
"But,uh,ann's gonna be okay."
She's not gonna be okay.
We read the papers.
"She killed a man with a knife,"
And she's not denying it.
They called her a whore.
I'm not a whore.
Then why's it say so in the papers?
Get them out of here.
I don't want them around for trial.
"- My, oh, my, oh, my."
"But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em."
- Yeah!
"- Come on, Shorty."
Mush!
- Come on.
Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
"We've gotta make a touch, Shorty."
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
"Yeah, I been noticing that."
You're the doctor.
You know what's good for ya.
"The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job."
"Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it."
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs?
"All right, all right."
"No offense, boss."
No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
"My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!"
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second time he's attacked me!
"Yeah, he's crazy about you!"
Can't you see?
"Wait a minute, partner."
I'll give you a chance to make some money.
I guess.
"Professor, let's see the medallion."
"Have you got an idea, MacGyver?"
"Well, if the cult took the Torch out of the Ark, maybe they built a bigger, better one."
But where is it?
I think we're in it.
Are you suggesting that this entire chamber is a giant Ark?
This could be the key.
Then we need to find a keyhole.
Maybe not.
The Torch of Truth.
It's more magnificent than I ever imagined.
Wait a minute.
Just wait.
I guess it's all right.
You're wrong.
"These caves are full of unpleasant surprises,"
I'm afraid.
"Lord Cleeve, at your service."
"I owe you a debt of thanks, Mr. MacGyver."
"And you too, Miss Carson."
"Now, if you'd mind just handing over the Torch to my partner."
Partner?
"I'm truly sorry, MacGyver."
"I don't like this, Cleeve."
You promised not to hurt them.
"I wouldn't dream of it, but we can hardly have them following us, now can we?"
I trusted you.
"How can you do this, Atticus?"
You're not a criminal.
We have what we came for.
Let's get out of here.
First I wanna know where the clothes are from.
You'd rather walk naked than receive a gift from me.
You'll bring the stuff back to where it came from.
Understand?
"- So, I might as well just leave!"
"- Yep, you might as well."
Where did you get them from?
- A girl gave them to me and she...
- Watch out.
"I tell you, watch out."
"Don't be mad at me, Franz."
"Well, none of us is an angel."
"Move, don't stand around."
Let's go down to the pub.
- What?
You really want to go?
"- Sure, why not?"
Stop bothering it.
"You, stop smoking."
The air in here is bad enough already.
You're crazy.
"They've never been inside a cage, they don't understand."
What about Franz?
- He doesn't want the clothes
"- But I want Biberkopf, I want him!"
- I won't do it.
- If I want Biberkopf I get him!
- What do you want with that guy?
"The weaklings, I have no use for them."
Leave that little bird alone already.
"Herr Biberkopf, my tie came undone."
Don't you have one of your patented clip-on ties?
Wow.
"That's great, Warren."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"You slept with him, didn't you?"
"- Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"- Yes, you did."
"I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour."
"So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?"
"And I say to him,"
"""Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes"
"""to get the kind of results that you're looking for,"" okay?"
"So then he says to me, ""Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"""
"And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,"
"""You can never have enough capacitance probes."""
"Oh, my God."
What the hell is wrong with you?
"Oh, nothing."
I hope nothing.
"You just got promoted, man."
You should be happy.
"I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing."
"And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing."
"- Oh, give me a break, Ben."
- What?
You have everything.
"You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud."
Is that nothing?
"Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle."
Hey.
"It dazzles me, mister."
- You are amazing.
- I feel like you can tell that I tried to spit my gum out.
- Such a terrible actor.
"- Oh, my God."
"I love the audience, like, reaction whenever Ari does something gross."
- It's so amazing.
- People really get vocal.
"Okay, this is my favorite thing, right here."
"Sounds like fun, right?"
Not always.
Scary.
"- That is a genius, genius line."
- So good.
Genius.
Ari.
And that was all you.
You made all that up.
You guys are so supportive.
I love you.
I guess Jonny looks a little like Josh Harnett.
- I can see it.
- He's just so chiseled.
- But I don't think that they look...
- So chiseled.
He's angular.
"I love the end of this scene what you guys do, what Mike and Kat do."
You're relating to each other silently for one of the only times in the movie.
"And there's this whole thing, Mike, where..."
Now you decided you gonna be on her side and not on your friends' side.
Right.
"If you watch carefully, you do this gesture that's like..."
- We're a team.
It was for you.
I've been trying to call you.
"I just had,like,the most amazing stream of consciousness right now."
"I'm gonna write us a rock opera, you know,that we could,like,sing together."
"How we met and how we made love,and it... it's like..."
# The sky was opened... #
I can't sing.
And that's okay.
God.
It's like every time
"- that I see you,I,I,I..."
- Johnny.
I'm just so into you.
God!
You know what?
"I want to,like,get tattoos together and drink each other's blood."
We need to break up.
- No.
"- Johnny, you asked me to give another week."
I gave it another week four times.
- It's not working.
"- No,it's working."
"Okay,it,it's,it's just working so well that you just can't see it, and that,like,terrifies you,man."
"Look,we're in different places."
You want to drink my blood.
"I want to go have margaritas and,like see a movie or something."
I can't take all the emotion and crying.
And on my birthday.
Uh...
I'm so sorry.
You didn't remember my birthday?
!
See you at midnight?
unless you want to concede right now...
Oh and next year
You don't want to take the subway to school.
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house. it's on park.
Well so much for that.
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.
No. the cycle of abuse must be broken.
The monarchy ends tonight.
Hey. why are you sitting here all alone?
I'm waiting to approve a special insert
My name was left off the list of graduates.
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.
Well at least you're special.
- Mr. Humphrey?
- Oh thank you.
"""We apologize for the inadvertent omission"
"""of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program."
He is indeed graduating.
"Congratulations Don."""
That's perfect.
I haven't seen you around.
Have you been looking?
How are you?
I'm fine.
No I'm great.
Um But I could be better.
I... was wondering if you heard that I...
I'm...
I'm so happy high school's over.
Congratulations.
You too.
"Enjoy your champagne and caviar at the Ritz, Your Highness."
I am not rich.
My pager.
- Maybe this suit was a little much.
- You're a fox.
"Now, don't start."
- No.
- What?
- Rory's running late.
- Late from what?
She doesn't say.
"She'll be here, but if she's not here by 7:00, she'll sneak in the back."
- That's weird.
- She'll be here.
Don't worry.
I hope so.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
There's no time.
You sure somebody's not yanking your chain?
There it is.
Ssr.
Don't move.
Don't think he can.
This is it.
We got the stark stuff.
That's like the whole haul.
"Ease up on that, will you?"
I don't want to end up inside out.
We're getting promotions out of this.
Why?
'cause we answered the phone?
This got handed to us...
again.
Somebody's wrapping this up like it was christmas.
Christmas?
"Well, hey, who doesn't love christmas?"
I'm gonna call chief.
I want every single box checked and signed in.
"Careful with that, boys."
"Hey, keep it sealed off!"
You got it!
Who's our new helpful friend?
Jerome zandow.
He had an act in a sideshow at coney island.
Petty crimes here and there.
Probably just muscle for hire.
Even muscle knows something.
"He had his hands on an arsenal of stark technology,"
But he just sat there with it.
"Whatever he's done in the past, forgiving him is better than ignoring him."
"Tom, you shouldn't be spending your last..."
"What, lecturing you?"
Why not?
I hope your gran is right.
About what?
The next life.
Specially that bit about the new body.
I'm gonna need that!
"If we don't get new bodies, it'll be easy to spot the post-mortems in heaven."
Thanks for being here.
"I'm glad I'm here, Tom."
"Grand Chief, it is Yongeum Island, Yi Do-hyung's hideout."
You called for me?
I don't see Yum Moon.
Where is he?
Go and bring him.
"Yes, sir."
We will land here.
It'll be about a half day's march from this landing site to their camp.
Was there any guard at the landing site?
It is a large island.
They don't have enough men to cover this area.
"Why don't we just go straight to where Yi Do-hyung's ship is docked, and attack them?"
Lt'll be to our disadvantage if they see us coming.
We are outnumbered.
Where is Yum Moon?
Head Chief is not on the island.
What do you mean?
He has gone to attack Buryung in order to secure provisions and weapons.
Where is Chief Jang?
What did he come for?
You could speak to me more gently!
Wasn't it for this shitty life that you married me?
Haven't you seen Niaré?
Don't talk to me about him.
I've got a thousand like him.
And he doesn't have shit.
"Sure, now you can slut around all you like, but when I build houses... and give your father cars, you don't say a word."
"Speak, then."
I know how you made your fortune.
"Your father, a common employee, corrupted... the public services, and you're even proud of it."
Go to hell!
I'll make you choke on that!
I'll choke you...
Calm down!
Everything will be settled... today.
Who went and told the cops?
You couldn't keep your mouths shut.
This was bound to happen.
Who could have betrayed us?
I don't know.
I'll go look for Sissoko.
Sissoko!
What's that on your pants?
- Is it here?
- Yes.
Wait for me!
Come and see.
I'll report it...
Get back to work!
- Get back to work!
- Never!
It's just like an animal.
"Look, it's chewing it."
Don't be silly.
Get a condom for next time.
Is your wife alright?
She's alright.
- What if she finds out?
- Hum... yeah?
Are you going to tell her that it wasn't serious with me?
What!
?
I told you I was gone on you.
It should have been you.
I met you too late to be my wife.
Would you try to understand the feelings of a pervert?
What kind of question is that?
I've had a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
It's very eerie.
Yeah?
Ah!
How does a pervert who's obsessed with you feel?
I can understand that to a degree.
Then you're a slut!
I haven't worked for Dark Publishing for a long time.
But I'm going to do some work for them.
"Pleasurable work, remember?"
Do you wanna come with me?
"No, thank you!"
Everyone loves your nude pictures.
They've received so many enquiries about you from other magazines.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Yes.
That's what I was telling you.
"I only did mushrooms once, in high school, but I remember it like it was yesterday."
I'm returning what's left over tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Here.
Good news.
Dr. Black says you haven't had any seizure activity in 24 hours.
- You can go home now.
- Good.
"And as it turns out, we still have a home."
"Our lawyer says, if you're psychotic when you give away everything you own, it doesn't count."
"The nurse doesn't need to hear our problems, sweetheart."
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"You seem quite different today, Mr. Myers."
How are you feeling now?
Like I need to get back to the office.
We're fighting a hostile takeover.
We're in the middle of a new ad campaign.
I haven't been away from my desk this long in years.
Hear that?
I have my baby back.
- Mr. Myers.
- Ian.
- U look terrific.
"- Thank you, sir."
"Well, I turned in my toga."
Ian.
"- God, thank you so much for everything."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We're thinking what this place needs is a donor wall.
One of many.
"Marjorie, please."
What?
She's here.
That's a good thing.
"It is, but I think I have the right to know why she's here and if she's going to stay this time."
Just drop--
"Uh, could you, um, set the dining room table for us, please?"
I cannot believe you!
"Shh, I know."
Shh...
I thought we agreed we'd be a united front.
Yeah.
"Listen, I spent the day with her today."
And I really believe that we all have an opportunity here.
"And, Marjorie, I don't want to drive her away again."
"We have been down this road before and every time-- every time, we fail."
"Yeah, all of us."
But let's-- can we just have some dinner?
As a family?
"Pasta's not overcooked, I hope?"
It's really good.
"So, have you, um... have thought about your plans now that you're home?"
No.
"Well, I'm here,"
If you want help with your resume or if you decide you want to apply to university again.
"Well, I just got back an hour ago."
Of course.
"Um, we can think ahead."
"She is, actually."
Sarah tells me that she wants to pursue art.
"Yeah, maybe even, um, art school."
Mr. Assanai why are you back?
I thought you got better.
I miss you.
So I thought I'd visit.
Yeah?
Room 5 please.
Number 117.
"That day if I thought of you only as a patient, I wouldn't have felt anything."
"But being that we're friends,"
I felt sad.
So I hoped that you're feeling well.
And I wouldn't have to see you again.
"I'm feeling well, doc."
I just wanted to see you again.
There is one thing I wanted to tell you.
But I didn't get to tell you.
"When you told me to go to the beach,"
I really went there.
I never thought I'd want to sit and watch the sunset.
But you told me to.
So I watched it that day.
"Honestly, seeing the sunset was a waste of time, but that day I don't know why, I..."
I sat there for hours.
That day I felt like
I could breathe easily.
And I was happy.
Just like every time I see you.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
I thought you said you were feeling well.
I hope next month we won't see each other again.
FEDERALPROSECUTOR SAMELLISIS WIDELYEXPECTED
- Is that one of those...
- Yeah.
I wasn't here when everything went down
"Between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad."
Here.
"Yeah, this feels right."
Yeah.
It must've been bad.
"I mean, all that stuff with Ogawa."
Giving Dickinson the file.
He wanted more than the sword.
He wanted to mess us up as a team.
It worked.
"Well, I don't know how to work with him right now."
The thing about Artie is that he's lost
A lot of people in his life--including agents.
So now he just shuts everybody out.
It's a defense mechanism.
That's not an excuse.
It's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does.
It's not meant to be an excuse.
Just an explanation.
"Artie acts like he doesn't care,"
But he does--about you both--a lot.
And that scares him.
"Well, I guess he needs to work that out, doesn't he?"
"You know, just because he lost people,"
It doesn't make us expendable.
I'm not a red shirt.
I'm not.
She's upset because I don't communicate.
"Did she not notice the word ""secret"""
Yeah?
"""To Mr. Thomas W. Smith."
Subject:
Promotion.
"Effective July 12th, you'll report to Division Superintendent James to assume your new duties as assistant general shop foreman. """
"- Well, congratulations, boy."
- Thanks.
Well...
You seem glad to get rid of your old foreman.
"No, we ain't."
Glad to see you get it.
"Hey, Tommy, who's gonna crack the whip in your place?"
"As far as I know, the job's still open."
They'll fill it the way they always have.
Move the best man up.
"Well who would you say the best man is, Tommy?"
Heh-heh.
"Kid, if they ask me, I'll have to tell them you're all pretty good."
Ha-ha.
You know darn well I'm better than pretty good.
Sure.
You're the guy that wrote those books Dombrowski's always studying.
"There's one for you, wise guy."
"Hey, there she blows."
Let's go back.
"Till Monday, I'm still the best man."
"Yes, sir, Mr. Smith."
"Hey, you big ape, you."
Get in there.
Tommy was kidding.
You've been here longer than the rest.
You can run this shop as well as you run that drill press.
No rush.
They're bringing the horses around.
No rush?
I feel awful we stopped at all.
You swear you didn't do it for me.
Because I'm a terrible rider.
We've gained time on horseback
We never would have achieved by carriage.
But we needed rest.
The horses were about to drop as well.
"And, in truth, it may not matter."
My mother might already be dead.
Don't say that.
You might think
She deserves it after all she's done.
To mary.
I think even mary would say that's in the past.
It will be soon
If I can convince my father to spare her life.
"It's unbelievable, really."
What?
"If all goes well,"
Bash begins his life with mary and I get exile.
And my mother.
Not for long.
"I'll set her up somewhere, far away, with my brothers"
And then...
I'll be on to the next.
Where will you go?
I was thinking morocco.
You don't think you'd stand out in morocco?
Sweden then.

"♪ She's a superfreak, superfreak ♪"

What was that?
You are not going to believe this.
At work I got all these compliments about the no-makeup thing.
"I mean, people telling me I looked great, and, like, younger."
Really?
Yes!
"And I actually got carded at lunch, and then I went to 2 other places, got carded again."
"I'm not gonna lie to you, honey."
I'm a little looped.
[Laughs]
That's--that's great.
Great for you.
"It is great, isn't it?"
We decided to be more honest with each other.
"You know, set some goals, work on some stuff, and we did it."
"Yeah, we--we did it."
Yeah.
You're done.
Wow.
"It's like without my makeup, my eyes stand out in this really great way."
And my mouth is so naturally pouty.
"I tell you, this telling each other stuff was the best thing we ever did, babe."
"You know, there is other stuff."
Huh?
"There's more things that you could work on about yourself, you know."
There are?
"A couple, yeah."
"Well, how come you didn't mention it the other night?"
I guess I didn't want to dump everything on you all at once.

I take back every single word I wrote.
You think you can just take it back like a bathing suit you've worn three times with the tags tucked in?
No way.
I'm your hero.
No!
Our history together will show
I think you're the absolute worst.
"But now I'll forever know how you really feel about me, which is, ""Everything my mother does comes from her heart."""
Stop using my words against me.
You are not my hero.
I read a document that says otherwise.
"God, you ruin everything!"
"And yet I'm your ""beacon on the hill."""
I resent you so much right now.
"But yet you love me ""more than anyone."""
"This is ""my worst nightmare."""
And it's my dream.
Yes.
Only such a handsome man could have sent such marvelous flowers.
"Thank you, mademoiselle."
L- i wonder if you'd care to join me in a bottle of wine at the astor house?
Just we two alone?
Just we two alone.
But we'll have to hurry.
Fleurique is ready.
We go.
"Good night, my dear."
"Uh, we better go this way."
Come in.
Mademoiselle fleurique in?
She's gone to the astor house.
"Well, already."
Well- with that fool mr.
"Fisk, who sent her these."
What does that fool mr.
Fisk look like?
"Tall, dark, kind of handsome."
He's going to have a peck of trouble on his hands tonight.
Everybody that has any truck with her has got trouble.
"Look at this room, will you?"
She threw all these things at me.
"Peppery, ain't she?"
"Oh, she'd throw anything anywhere."
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't blow up at the astor house.
"If she treats you that way, why do you stick?"
It's a long walk back to illinois.
"Excuse me, please."
"Besides, if you want something real bad, you've got to take some hard knocks to get it."
You've learned a lot for a young lady.
We've got time before school to see what's on this.
"- Okay, you'll be standing in a line."
- _
"Shoulders back, like this."
That's good.
"And, as you're introduced, you'll step up."
"Look, I've upgraded from texting to voice-mail to further express my level of ""you are so dead."""
"(SIGHS) I bite the bullet and I tell my dad about you, then you ghost?"
"That is not getting back together, Jake."
This is all very strange.
Call me.
"Hey, I know we don't really know each other, but this Lady of the Lake Pageant does not seem like your thing."
My dad is making me.
Maddox pride.
"So, then, he'll be your escort?"
"Oh, I haven't even thought about that."
"Um, no."
Who has their dad as their escort?
"Uh, I do. (CHUCKLES)"
And I avoid all high school guy drama.
Win-win.
"Oh, please."
Everybody knows you have a crush on Noah.
You practically give him eye baths in psych class.
"- Okay, no, I do not do that."
- A little bit.
"Okay, well, maybe there's a world where I think Noah is kind of cool."
- Happy?
- (SCOFFS)
Hold that thought.
WOMAN:
"Okay, ladies, grab a worksheet."
Yeah?
Yeah.
"Uh, he's sick in the hospital."
We just come by to water his plants and look after the place for him.
Hospital?
Is it serious?
"Uh, yeah, it's pretty serious."
They're still trying to figure out what he has.
Damn.
(SIGHS)
It's good you guys are looking after the place.
Yeah.
"I mean, we don't mind, so-"
(CLEARS THROAT) But I better get back to it.
"No, dude."
We're over here tonight because we're not in the photo from last night.
It's that simple.
"Well, it's not like fate decided it."
"Presumably, we made decisions yesterday that made us end up here today."
"All right, my brain just kinda melted a bit."
What was the original question?
"The question is, if you could choose something to show up in the next photo, anything, what would you choose to see?"
I'm a little ashamed at how good it felt to buy this dress.
Back to the question.
Easy.
I want a pile of money so big that I'm fuckin' buried in it.
You are so predictable.
Me?
What about you?
We all know what you wanna see most.
A rock.
(SCOFFS)
I'm glad I know that too.
"I mean, that you love him."
"If I hated him, I'd be all right, then we could walk down the street together and I wouldn't mind feeling him cringe, never let on."
I should've gone away from here a long time ago.
But he's hard to leave.
-Now I gotta get out of here fast.
"-Don't run away, Brock."
"Mr. McCurtin could get you off, couldn't he;"
"Oh, sure, easy."
Jury wouldn't even leave its box.
-Then face it like Papa wants you to.
"-Ever been to a trial, Sarah Beth;"
Lots of things come out of trials.
Whole mess comes out.
Salt Fork would eat this up with a spoon.
And he's had enough.
"Go on, Sarah Beth, sit down and play a tune by yourself."
You'll have to get used to it.
And tell the colonel nothing.
Jeff said McCurtin was here.
What'd he want;
-Nothing.
-Where you going;
-First lap on my trip to Denver.
"-Get down off that horse, Brock."
Get out of my way.
"Well, Sarah Beth, I'll try to understand why he had to go."
I didn't try with someone else a long time ago.
I've always been sorry.
"Well, colonel, then if Brock ain't here, we just gotta find him and take him in."
-Why;
-l thought McCurtin told you.
I wallow in the mud.
You're a construction worker?
Isn't that the photographer?
Everything alright?
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
We'll take you back.
Shall I tell you about the development of labor movements during the industrial age  just to pass away the time?
Some other time.
- There they are.
Good evening everyone.
- Here you are.
- I was worried.
I know I shouldn't be taking walks anymore.
Can I help you?
"I'm fine, thank you."
I have to leave.
Why?
Now you can tell me about what you're working on.
Who'd want to know?
Oh I'm interested in it.
- But you'll be sure to spoil it any moment now.
How old are you?
I'm not saying.
"Variety, you know what I'm saying?"
"Sure, my mother worked in a variety theater."
As a dancer?
As a cloak room attendant.
"Nora, we're making you an offer."
You'll sing for us on the weekend and work as a waitress.
Both?
Not at the same time.
I know that.
"When you think what might happen to the one you love, of course it's a downer."
Or did Kiefer say something to you before our dispatch?
You dying scares me the most.
"Hey, c'mon!"
What?
!
"Welp, I'm off to fetch water."
We're off to the woods to gather some firewood.
What about the tents?
"Take care of it while we're out, okay?"
"Ah, it's so nice and clear out today, huh?"
"Good luck, Ryner!"
Then I guess I'll get an afternoon nap.
Ryner...
"Ryner, would you run away with me?"
"Come on, come with me."
Not with Sion.
With me...
What are you talking about?
"I care for you, Ryner."
I've always cared for you.
"Even though it was hopeless, I couldn't help falling for you."
"Ryner, you don't like me, do you?"
"Oh, come off it, Kiefer."
Joking around at a time like this?
"Yeah, you're right."
I guess I can't have anything.
"- No, I didn't mean..."
"- Even so, I didn't want you to die."
"I'm sorry, Ryner."
I couldn't protect you.
I offer up this contract to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps within the atmosphere!
Everybody move back!
"What do you mean, evacuate?"
My daughter is in that building!
This is an emergency.
Move back now!
Please!
Clear the area now!
Move back now!
I said move back now!
Okay.
"Oh, there I am."
That's not a bad picture.
How'd they find out I did that one?
Buhbye.
"Whatever happened to ""the pen is mightier than the sword""?"
"Martin, as the president of the United States.."
"this comes with the full weight, power and authority of my office:"
Fuck you.
You okay?
Can we get down to business now?
I'm gonna need you to open this for me.
What is that?
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"This is the nuclear football, sweetie."
It is keyed to the blood type and heartbeat of the president.
What the hell is this?
This is the deal.
There's a dozen reasons why that's not gonna work.
Such as?
"Even if I open it, my codes are useless."
They switched them out once you took over the building.
You let me worry about that.
"I was watching him, disgraceful."
Fancy a man of that class daring to put his hand on a lady's knee!
"- Ah, well done, Barnes."
- Thank you.
"Thank you, Barnes."
I'll give you one.
I'll give you one.
'Twas a dirty night and a dirty trick
When a ship turned over in the Atlantic...
They'll be here all night at this rate.
(Chuckles) It's the toffs entertaining the workers.
What about us?
We're workers.
Pearls before swine.
They were guzzling that fine wine as if it were beer.
"It's a topsy-turvy world, James."
Have a glass of port.
(Laughter and applause)
"All right, I will."
Pass the cigars.
Can I 'ave some raspberryade?
* So I pulled her into bed and I covered up her head
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew"
* Now I am a bachelor I live with my son
* And we work at the weaver's trade
"* And every, every time I look into his eyes"
* He reminds me of that fair young maid
* He reminds me of the summertime
* And of the winter too
"* And the many, many times that I held her in my arms"
"* Just to save her from the foggy, foggy dew *"
"Bravo, Charles!"
"♪ I can't go for that, no, no can do ♪"
I was already on edge.
"The day before, I was with my mom at the park when some guy on a bike swiped her phone."
He must have been a criminal mastermind.
He struck the one second she wasn't taking pictures of Joe.
"The worst part is, I saw him grab it."
"I had a chance to do something and be a hero to my mom, but I froze."
"What would you have done, made him the subject of a satirical cartoon?"
Hey!
"Uh, they've taken down presidents."
"Now, can you just support me here?"
There are only so many moments a son has a chance to...
"- Blah, blah, blah, blah."
- Very mature.
Pick a fight then tune me out?
- It's not bothering me.
- Stop it!
"Dad, turn down that song!"
♪ No can do ♪
"You sure, Manny?"
Positive.
I-I'll walk home.
- We almost died.
- Yeah.
White.
"Yes, I'm sure."
Why is it so hard for you to imagine that a criminal can be white when most of the...
"Ah, the bicycle."
"Yes, yes, it was white."
I thought your phone got stolen?
This is Joe's phone.
This is why the terrorists hate us.
"Uh, celery's all right, isn't it?"
"Oh, it's fine."
There's only one problem.
"It's in the refrigerator, in the back... and you're gonna have to work your way through a lot of other stuff to get to it."
"Emily, I wasn't even thinking about the banana cream pie."
"Honey, why don't you just come to bed and don't worry about it?"
"Yeah, you're right."
I'll... worry about it tomorrow.
- Good night.
"- Good night, honey."
Let's see.
An eighth of a pound...
in five hours.
That's more than a half a pound a day.
"In a year, I'll weigh..."
a little over 400 pounds.
"Well, this is it, Bob."
"You're really gonna love this place, and these noon classes are really the best... because all the greatest-looking chicks are here."
"We got... models, dancers, secretaries."
"Jerry, you didn't tell me there'd be girls here."
- Sure.
What do you think I'm doing here?
"- Well, I don't care, Jerry..."
- as long as I lose eight pounds.
"- Exercise is the key, Bob."
More important than dieting.
I don't diet and look at me.
That's Olga.
She is in charge here.
- Guess how old she is.
"- Uh, 65?"
That's right.
"Lack of education, that's the problem."
That's why we're doing this demonstration :
For your education.
A beer.
A soda.
Thank you.
"That's Nora, she works for us now."
"I hope you pick up a lot from her,  Angela."
"Am I fired now, or what?"
"Angie, how can you pick up anything from Nora if your fired?"
"Won't work, right?"
I wanted to excuse myself for my faux pas.
- Faux pas.
"You have a problem with women, my dear, as large as this building."
"And you're resentful, stubborn, and complicated."
I don't even want to get into your problem with men.
Again with another attack against me.
You can go ahead and excuse yourself again.
- I wouldn't do that.
Fine then!
I'm a kind-hearted person.
Me too.
I'll be glad to get out of here.
I can imagine.
You'll give me a ride?
Of course.
Lie down next to me.
Get some sleep.
All these people are driving me crazy.
I don't understand what they are talking about.
I don't know what they want from me.
No discussion.
What?
With the money from this.
My girlfriend needs bigger boobs.
It's the first thing I'm buyin'.
What about you?
I like my boobs.
"So your girlfriend just straight up said, honey, buy me boobs?"
"Naw, she didn't know about it, but she's mad at me, so,"
I'm gonna surprise her.
"Hey, turn around for a sec."
Where'd you get your boobs?
"Yours are real, huh?"
Nice.
"Riley, if you don't stop looking at my boobs,"
"I will uppercut your dick,"
I swear to God.
That would hurt.
Is everything okay?
"Yeah, Riley's just telling me about how he's buying new boobs for his girlfriend."
"What, is she mad at you or something, Riley?"
Yeah.
She mad at me 'cause I wanna go to Mars.
This just keeps gettin' better and better.
Wait.
You were serious?
"Yeah, and I signed up on a program, where you can win a one-way trip to Mars."
I think it's like a nine-month ride in space.
"And she don't understand why I wanna do it, but I'm like, come on, man."
It's Mars.
"Like, I could be the Magellan of space."
"I mean, I might not actually be Magellan."
I'm sure I'd be like his first mate or somethin'.
"Flynn, are you all right?"
"Yeah, I'm great."
- What are you doing here?
- My counselor brought me.
Your boss said you had an accident.
Yeah.
Your story checks out.
"Well, I'm sorry for the security measures."
Are you comfortable?
Give me what I want and I don't give a damn where you hold me.
"You fought against the Hunters, but now you want to join them?"
The humans took me away from my mother.
They took my baby.
"They used me, made me fight against the Hunters."
I want to be with my own kind.
I think I believe that.
So Liana's coming for me?
Not quite yet.
"First time I shot up, I was 16."
I was a punky-ass kid on a skateboard.
"In the parking lot of a 7-11 in Davenport, Texas,"
I bought a dime bag from a dealer named Shotgun Vallardo.
One taste and I was hooked.
So you were a junkie.
Is that supposed to impress me?
"Oh, I wasn't hooked on the junk."
I was hooked on the deal.
Next day I was running for Shotgun.
"And six months later,"
Shotgun's wife was a widow and I had every last one of his buyers in my pocket.
"See, we're the same under the skin, you, me, all us Hunters."
We have the same animal urges.
He's really fun to be with.
"Maybe ""fun"" isn't the word."
He's interesting.
- How many men can you say that about?
- Not many.
Is a tie too personal a birthday gift?
Are you using it on something other than his neck?
Does he look good in vests?
Why do you want him to meet your mother?
"I kept saying I was a great cook, so I offered him a birthday dinner."
Now I need something nice.
"After meeting her, I won't see him again."
"- Hi, girls."
Rose!
"- Hi, Claire."
- I'm starving.
Can we eat?
"- I can't, I have a date with a post-grad."
Help her find a gift for Dr. Strangelove.
Who?
We should get you some blush.
"- I'm hungry, Claire."
"- No, fruit."
Why are you so grumpy today?
"If he wasn't gorgeous, rich and straight, I wouldn't have bothered."
"I'm sick to death of the man I am bound to for eternity, that's all."
Why are you saying that?
"No matter where I go, what I do, there he is."
"In the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the phone, on my finger."
I was asleep the other night.
"When I wake up, he's staring at me."
- I think that's sweet.
"He's kind of weird, but he's quiet and always comes through with his half of the rent."
"But now, where were we?"
"Ah, yes, cloning."
Wait a second.
What do you want with me if it's the Tick you're after?
Don't you know anything?
You're the sidekick.
"I clone you, then send the evil clone to procure a tissue sample of the Tick, so I can clone a million of him."
"And speaking of tissue samples,"
I need to get one from you.
[Whimpers] You don't want to do that.
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, I do."
Now hold still.
"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"
Cloning is a precise science.
That's why I use the Clonerizer.
"It costs more, but you get what you pay for."
My own recipe includes a generous portion of Dr. Flack's secret cloning sauce.
"A pinch of oregano, 'cause, you know, a little goes a long way."
"And last, but not least, your toenail."
"Mix well, and... voilà."
"Arthur the Sidekick, prepare to meet Arthur the Evil Clone."
I Arthur.
I Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur, I Arthur."
"I Arthur, I Arth-ur."
I-I-I Arthur-Arthur.
"I Arthur, I Arthur."
"[Chuckles] He's an eager little bunny, isn't he?"
They're a bit excitable at first.
[Gasps] No!
I'm gonna have some coffee.
"What do you want, some, uh, milk, or what?"
Milk?
Coffee's fine.
- Yeah.
I drink it.
I'm hip.
- (CLICKS FINGERS)
I don't know.
"This is espresso, you know?"
It's like coffee-zilla.
"I said, I'm hip."
So she moved me up a grade because I wasn't fitting in.
"So, now I'm even more not fitting in."
I was getting good grades.
"You know, like all A's."
"So, my mom says, ""You need stimulation."""
"And I go, ""No, I'm stimulated enough right now."""
- That's for sure.
"- She goes,"
"""Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge."
"""You need a challenge."" So, now I'm challenged, all right."
"I'm challenged to hold on to my lunch money, because of all the big mooses who wanna pound me because I'm a shrimpy dork who thinks he's smarter than them."
"But I don't think I am smarter, I just do the stupid homework."
If everyone else just did the stupid homework they could move up a grade and get pounded too.
Is there anymore coffee?
"Look, it's really none of my business, kid, but, um, who cares what these creeps think, you know?"
They don't decide who you are.
You do.
You are who you choose to be.
(CLATTERING)
Did you hear that?
You can never get to grips with that.
"The asshole who killed him, is still walking around free."
If he's still alive.
He'd be way over 60 now.
You're so quiet.
I've nothing else to report.
I had to be in the area for work.
Insurance.
"Because I read about Ben in the newspaper, I wanted to see you."
Just for sentimental reasons.
We'll have to believe you came for me.
And not to sell me an insurance policy.
"-No, for you."
But I have to go now or I'll be late for my appointment.
Want my arm?
Come by when Bram's home.
He'd like that.
I sure will.
"Well, by then."
Well done.
How did you know?
-The sun didn't bother you.
You didn't blink.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Was it an accident?
-No.
My retina suddenly started to come off.
It happened within 2 hours.
Irreparable.
The specialist said it was a reaction to the war.
Stress and anxiety.
That those bastards are still ruining your life after all these years.

This place is really extraordinary.
How could there be such a place like this?
It's pretty enough to make me faint.
Then come again.
"People of Urk believe that if they take the pebbles from this beach, they will be able to come back here for sure."
Here.
"You just lied, didn't you."
"If what you said were true, you think there will still be pebbles left here?"
They would have been all gone.
The people who came back must have put the pebbles back to their rightful place.
Thanks for coming.
I asked you to come because of something important.
Claire had to... deal with something... absolutely extraordinary.
She told me about it.
And I thank her for that.
we want to share that news with you. and because we need your help. and changes our take on the world as we know it.
You'll have to accept.
We now share a common destiny.
Camille?
It can't be.
It's the truth.
you would know it's her.
Camille is back with us.
And we should all welcome her.
Does it mean... that other kids will come back?
She's giving us hope that others might come back.
You are safe.
I am so glad.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Doug:
Thanks a lot.
Ferrara:
"Have a good night, pal."
"All right, man."
I'll see you.
[ Car beeping ]
Let's say some guy drives you home because you were too drunk and you could kill yourself or somebody else.
What do you think that's worth?
Nothing!
Nothing!
"Don't give him a dime, and one day, you, too, will be driving a Bentley."
[ Sighs ]
You have no choice.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
"I don't care, tell them."
'Cause I'm not even going to be here.
I'm going to run away and no one will ever see me again.
"Good, go."
And who's even going to miss you?
You're just a little thief.
"Where you going, Chris?"
Who are you going to turn to?
You don't even have any friends.
(doorbell rings)
Hi.
I ran away from home.
Do you mind if I live with you?
Live with me?
"My goodness, I feel like"
I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming.
"Hot dog, it's real."
"Mr. Herbert, it's 6:00, I'm-I'm not really tired yet."
"Well, you had those three cups of Nyquil."
You'll be down soon enough.
"Okay, good night, Mr. Herbert."
"Sweet dreams, Chris."
"Mr. Herbert, what's life really all about?"
"Well, I suppose it's about trying new things;"
sampling the sweet and the savory;
not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
Wow.
I never looked at it like that before.
"Thanks, Mr. Herbert."
But don't you think it's scary to try new things?
"It's purple, bitch!"""
"Let me tell you, and they used to smoke all the time when I was in school, and I ain't never partake."
I was an outcast in school.
"A lot of folks are always like,"
"""Jay Pharoah, how you learn to come up with so many voices?"""
"I be like, ""Because I had no fucking friends."""
"I had to make people up."""
"That's why I get mad when people talk about bullying, like it's such a bad thing."
"You hear the, ""Stop the bullying!"""
Shut your dumb ass up!
"If I wouldn't have got bullied the way I got bullied,"
I wouldn't be on national television right now.
So all the time it's not a bad thing.
All right?
"Shoot, 'cause these little kids are punk asses nowadays."
They are punk asses.
"They be coming home bitching,"
"""Ehh!"
"He's bullying me."""
"""Well, bully him."""
"""Ehh!"
"He's talking about me."""
"""Talk about his ass."""
"""Ehh!"
"He hit me with a car."""
"""Then, bitch, shoot him."
How 'bout that?
"You know what I'm saying?"" Okay, all right."
I know.
I shouldn't talk about guns.
We've had terrible things happen.
"To the people in the Boston bombing, my heart goes out to them."
But it really doesn't matter because I like me.
"Well, I don't like you."
Whatever.
I love you.
I can't stand picking out tiles.
It drives me nuts to try to redo the fricking house.
I know it does.
"But, you know, the one thing that we can and should always do is just kind of have fun with each other."
"And truthfully, sweetheart, that should be the easiest thing to do because before there was the kids or the house or the job or any of it, there was just you."
"And I love you, Ronnie."
"I love you, too, Dave."
"Hey, now, all you naughty boys and girls, gather 'round, gather 'round."
The hell's she doing here?
Who?
That's my wife.
She must be looking for me.
I don't think so.
She looks fine.
You should just relax.
Son of a...
Excuse me!
Hey!
Peacock!
"Please, I don't want to hurt you."
"""Encouragement!"" Joey!"
"Baby, remember when we first met and I told you that you were the only man I'd ever been with?"
You lied?
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was...
"I was completely inexperienced, and, honey, I didn't know what I had in you."
I've been cheating on you!
I've been cheating on you every chance I got!
He is sticking to me like a leech and torturing me.
What sort of background work have you done?
He is in love with me.
You have easily dealt many men before this.
This guy doesn't even stand a chance.
You are being a bit restless.
Fetch me some water.
Deal with him with some patience.
If it doesn't work out... we'll change the plan.
Thomas.
"Get me my handbag from the backseat, please."
There is a pen inside.
This one?
- Open the cap.
Thanks.
Vasundhara!
- I can sense that you both involved in something.
What's it?
Vasundhara...
"- Tell me, what is it?"
It will not take any time for me to poke this into your throat!
(stuttering)
Ravi drafted the plan.
We went to Chennai to meet Varun...
Ravi sold all the jewels... we looted from Varun.
Ravi... has all the money.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
If uncle has taken such a step...
I'm the one to be blamed.
"I thought that if you had too much money, you will spend it all on alcohol and other such nonsense."
I have saved a share separately for you.
"Be careful who you trust, robinson crusoe."
Do you need anything?
"I happened to lay eyes on you earlier this morning, miss."
"I've been at sea over a year now, but I ain't forgotten what makes a woman a woman."
Come here!
Please!
I beg you!
Begging's good.
"You alert the whole camp, then I'll be everyone's property."
"But if you keep my secret, you'll also keep exclusive rights."
You're a sly one.
And no mistake.
Do we have a deal?
Nolan!
"Where are ya, ya gutless dog?"
We have a deal.
I'll be back soon.
You can rely on it.
Did you find the lad?
Yes and no.
The lad's a lady.
A bearded lady?
The beard's an old stage performance trick.
Your mating rituals are complicated enough as they are.
And that kind of thing will not help.
"She may be brave, but I would never normally put a woman's life in danger."
I need a different plan.
Where have you been?
The sacrificial burial ground.
"You're not the only one who has a plan, crusoe."
Those are human remains.
It would not be a burial ground if they were not.
We don't have time.
HENRY:
We should take the time.
"If we're going to be in a relationship, we want to get off to a good start."
You know what?
Why don't we just hang out here?
Do you like board games?
"Henry, I really want to see the movie."
The 7:30 movie.
"What you want, Dylan, is very important to me."
But what your parents want is just as important.
Good man.
Nice to get some respect.
You sleep on the bed.
Let the girls sleep on these.
"Okay, I'm sure they won't mind."
Thank you so much for letting them come over.
Letting them?
"Honey, this is your house, too, and your friends are always welcome here."
I'm so happy you made some friends.
I know how lonely you've been.
"Yeah, my old friends kind of abandoned me."
"Ah, who needs them?"
You're a darling girl.
You're smart and you're a lot of fun.
You girls have a good time tonight.
"Now, I've got pizzas and salad, there's some fruit, popcorn, cookies."
There's some leftover chicken.
I can make some flautas and guacamole.
Whatever you want.
I think the pizza and the salad will be enough.
Thank you so much.
"Before that, I was living here in Trnje for 30 years."
I know every house and street.
I kept knocking at the doors around to ask.
I'm sentimentally attached to this area.
So I decided to try my luck in Paromlinska street.
"So, this is how you came to me?"
People decide to rent their room after they've been suggested to do so.
I thought you were the one.
I don't know.
You have confused me.
Maybe I should tell you something about myself?
I'm retired for disability.
I was a land surveyor.
I could pay as much as you want.
I can make money in another way.
"Leave it, that's not..."
"I'm peaceful, too."
I don't play cards or bring women home.
I don't even drink or smoke.
"I'm mostly out, I even eat there."
"- That's ok, but I don't know..."
It is so suddenly.
"Understand me, I can't just do it right away."
You don't have to decide immediately.
I'll come in a day or two.
You think about it.
Ok?
- I don't know...
"Well, day or two, that would be fine."
Good.
"So, there is a chance, eh?"
"See you in a couple of days, then."
"You know, I think"
Henry and I should have the same last name.
"Yeah, I'm cool with that."
Henry Chase.
No.
Henry Krawchuck.
What do you mean?
"Well, what I mean is, I know I took a couple months to get back to you on your marriage proposal."
"The offer's still valid, right?"
Four more minutes.
"Well, the answer is yes."
So we're engaged.
Yeah.
"Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you, but how long do you want to wait before we have kids?"
Stay back!
What's going on?
What just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
"Oh, my God!"
Total 911!
Goblins have stormed our kitchen and they are eating all our sugar pops.
Tell them the milk has gone bad.
Was someone kept up late by a doggy-style celebration of love?
A little...all night long?
"I want all the hairy details, okay?"
"Okay, no."
"No details, hairy or otherwise."
I feel like crap.
Didn't you see Dyson last night?
- Yes.
"- Okay, well did you tell him you wanted him to be your boyfriend?"
Nothin.
I said I can't find anything wrong with her.
Mr. Smallwood.
I just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night.
Are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
"Listen, mister."
Connie called me.
"She told me that you check out, and that's good enough for me."
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
Never mind the issue of proof...
I will never allow his wrongdoing to succeed!
-How do you see the outcome of this race?
-How confident do you feel?
Thanks to the absence of Mac...
I now have great hopes of winning the title.
What about Black Eagle?
I've never even heard of him.
So it may safely be said that I will be the one to win the championship.
What's that?
Mac!
So you are going to participate in the race after all?
"Yes, this is the prototype of my missing engine."
"I had kept it at a friend's place, so it wasn't destroyed in the fire."
"It may be not as powerful as the other one, but I'll race with it."
"Good luck to you, Mac."
I'll do what little I can.
You're right.
Let's do our best.
Am I in time?
"It's really a fine day for flying, isn't it?"
Has Moriarty appeared?
"No, not yet."
Please take care of Mrs. Hudson.
I'll fly with Mac.
Right.
"Finally, the moment has come for me to show the world... that my ""Crow"" is Number One!"
Here!
Here!
I can't wait to see who's going to win the championship.
"Are you ready, Mrs. Hudson?"
Yes.
It's alright uncle.
How many people are so duty conscious like your son?
Feel proud of him.
"Sir, you're really great."
You will catch that thief.
"Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare."
You are his perfect partner.
You will catch him for sure.
He won't.
He will catch him.
He won't.
"He will catch him, you shorty."
You won't catch him.
You stupid.
"I'm telling you, he will catch him."
Why are talking nonsense?
Why are you interfering in our matters?
I am talking to my brother-in-law.
You can't catch him even if he stands in front of you.
You won't catch him.
No way.
Day after tomorrow is very auspicious.
Lets fix the engagement on that day.
No.
I've an urgent meeting on that day.
Ministers are coming from India.
Actually...
Sorry.
Don't mistake me.
This meeting was fixed a month back.
Important business deal.
We will have it next week.
There are other people interested.
You thinking about selling to the Vietnamese?
I'm not gonna say who.
"I gotta do what's best, right?"
"You want my money in your bank, I want that Eastern territory."
"I'm not saying we won't make a deal, but there are other people interested and I wanna listen to what they have to say."
"You sell me the East, I make sure you make a lot of money."
- Keep talking.
- It's all I'm asking.
I got a meeting with this guy in 10 minutes.
- Where is this gonna be?
"- 400 block, Powell."
I'm in my car.
Let's go.
Julianna Vejzna?
Immigration.
"Would you come along with me, please."
- Am I being arrested?
"- Yes, you are."
Why?
Why are you arresting me?
"I'm sorry, I don't know the details."
Watch your head.
The Chickadee club's laid out like this.
"Two exit doors at the back, Ronnie's office, then you got the stage."
"These exits doors are open, or locked up?"
I don't know.
Can I get out that way is what I need to know.
Have they got chains?
I'll see if I can find out.
"This is the club here, all this."
"This is the lounge and your front doors, here and here."
Not that she was drinking or anything.
I think it was a bad trip fajitas.
Yes?
I'll be right there.
Excuse me!
What are you doing?
Pretty naughty!
What do you think about us going on a real date?
"I mean don't get me wrong, secret sex is awesome."
"Really awesome, but I think that you and I actually dating awesom... er."
On that thought.
We have a situation up here.
What sort of situation?
I'm kinda busy in here.
Code red.
I'll be right back.
"Someone drop the dime, called the coppers."
"Someone on the Greek task force phoned Bowman to say, claiming there's booze."
- Come on.
- Chambers.
Execute plan B.
- But there's not time.
- I wouldn't be so sure
There's always time for plan B.
You fellas and spread out.
"Hey, boys!"
Care to join me for a drink?
What the hell are you doing?
"Taking your cruise out on the open road, see if I can hit a few miles an hour."
"You wanna join me, I'd love to have company!"
"Let him go, we always know where to find him."
- Not with my squad car.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Men fighting against bulls?
"Yes, yes, yes."
What did he say?
-That they would love to go.
I couldn't have translated it better.
(MAN) (COUGHING)
The fortune cookie was right.
Love and a cough can't be hidden.
"Get going, Luis."
And leave you here alone?
"No, don't even think it."
"Whatever way, you're coming with me."
-Don't be an idiot.
They won't let me board in this state.
I can't leave you alone with this fever.
You're burning up.
"On your way out, tell the guy that owns the guesthouse to call a doctor."
"But go now, you're going to miss your plane."
I'll leave you this so you can get by when you get better.
Hang in there.
(Door closes)
Is what you have to tell me very important?
It could be.
Tell me.
"Sit down, woman."
One of our internal agents called.
An hour ago someone checked into a hospital.
He was delirious and talking about a time door.
Couldn't he just be crazy or a science fiction fan?
Look.
"This is his picture in the hospital, taken this very morning."
Perkins!
Get this old goat moving!
"Look alive, boy!"
Sir.
"Move, you bastards!"
Get up!
"Saved you for the firing squad, Harper."
"Perkins tells me that you were once a common soldier, a sergeant."
- So I was.
- Strange.
"In Spain, an officer must be ""of the blood""."
Un caballero.
righteous but charming A gentleman
"Sorry, wrong house, Miss."
Is that why you have trouble with your men?
"Perkins told you that, did he?"
Yes.
He said you were a proper bastard.
He's right.
You may as well know the rest.
My mother was a whore.
I was born in a brothel.
Grew up in an orphanage and hope to die in the army.
Right?
But the boy Perkins says you saved the life of General Wellesley.
"And the Irishman, Harper, he says that when the English wish to honour a man of courage, they call him a proper bastard."
"You listen to soldiers' gossip, ma'am."
"Yes, I do."
"You see, we have two ears but only one mouth."
So a good leader will listen twice as much as he shouts.
"I beg your pardon, Mr Sharpe."
But she's as dry as a bone.
"Jo, you must play terribly quietly so that the man upstairs can sleep."
He won't hear anything.
"- Mummy, why..."
"- David, who do you suppose he is?"
A damn fool to be out in this weather.
He's not a working sailor.
- He's not a working sailor?
- No.
I noticed his hands are terribly soft.
His hands?
He's wearing a suit for God's sake.
"You're very observant all of a sudden, aren't you?"
I'm going over to Tom's.
David.
Suppose he wakes up?
"Who's that man in my room, Mummy?"
"I don't know, darling."
..a girl with long blonde hair with diamonds in it.
- Do you know what diamonds are?
"- Sort of treasures, aren't they?"
I must cut your hair soon.
"If you didn't, would it grow and grow and grow?"
Yes.
It would grow down to your ears.
Then it would go down to your chin.
Then it would grow down past here.
Then it would curl up here.
"Then it would start tickling your feet, and we'd all have to get out of the bath."
Why?
"Because if people don't get out of their baths, they melt."
But I haven't.
Mummy...
I knew you could do it!
Mr. Fuzzles!
"Thank you, Francis."
You can go now.
What?
What is it?
We've got something for you.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.
"-Here, put this on first."
-Roman candles?
"Well, that's how they started off."
We decided to give 'em a little more... oomph.
Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?
"-Hell, no!"
"Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds."
"You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump."
The rockets should kick in around there.
"They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that."
"Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool."
We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.
If the roof doesn't collapse.
Or ignite.
And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.
This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.
Nobody deserves it more than you.
Should I get the hose?
Not yet.
He would've wanted us to wait.
Good boy.
You finished all your peas!
"Hey, slugger."
Guess what.
Carter?
Ben went into the storm drains at first and pierce.
The city doesn't have any cameras down there.
And there are literally thousands of exit points.
"Yeah, Ben knows that."
He's been doing this a while.
This is him.
I'm gonna join you in.
"Listen, Ben barely trusts me so he can't know you're on, okay?"
Understood.
Andy will run a trace.
"Ben, talk to me, man."
I want $2 million.
"Not enough for what I've been through, but it's the most I can carry."
"Ben, you know I can't ask the government for that kind of money."
This is not an official operation.
It's not my problem.
You get me the money or I call bin-Khalid's men.
I took one of their phones at the construction site.
"Please, man, listen, you're strung out"
And you're not thinking straight.
"Eric, I've never been more clear in my life."
Show up at the 7th street metro station with my money in one hour.
An hour?
"Ben, you got to give me more time."
For the government to find me?
"No, you show up on time with the money,"
You get the list.
"If any of those things don't happen, Eric,"
I will sell the list to bin-Khalid's people.
Period.
Ben!
What's the last thing we want?
No panic.
Right.
"Okay, is the tutorial over?"
Let's get in there.
Out of here.
"Beers, is that you?"
"It's Janet Lewis, Beers."
You haven't been answering your phone.
Everything all right?
Beers?
"Oh, my God."
"You're right, that's not Beers."
But it sure looks like him.
He's not anybody anymore.
Looks like a stab wound.
"All right, it's time to shut down the airport."
Not a problem.
We've been unofficially shut down for the last 20 minutes.
No vehicles in or out until this storm ends.
"His gun's gone, Tony."
Great.
"We're snowed in here with an airport full of cranky passengers, a dead fake air marshal, and his killer somewhere on the loose, with a knife and a gun."
"Anybody else feel like they're playing ""Clue""?"
Unbelievable.
"These shots will be coming to you from Jake's phone, McGee."
"We'll send them to Ducky, too."
I think he's gonna be busy for a while.
"""And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast."""
"Yet I'm the one who had to get out and push the van, Shakespeare."
"That was W.C. Fields, Mr. Palmer, in The Fatal Glass of Beer."
And I predict you will be pushing it again on the way back.
"""with the $12.95."
"And I got away with it."""
I had a gangster situation happen to me where I had to be gangster in the situation.
You just had to be.
"Sometimes you just gotta, you know, buck up and do what you gotta do."
I was trying to get a cab in February.
"The cabdriver saw me, looked at me, and then sped the hell off."
But he got caught at the red light that was right in front of me.
"So I was like, ""Oh, snap!"" So you know what I did?"
I went Denzel Washington Training Day on his ass right there.
I was like...
"""Okay, all right."""
"""Yeah, my nigga, my nigga."""
"""Yeah, so you're telling me"
"""you were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""That's what you're saying, right, huh?"
"""You were just gonna drive--"
"""That's what you saying."
Huh?
"""You were just gonna drive off, huh?"
"""It's negative 20 degrees out here."
"""My fingers are about to fall off my hand,"
"""but you was about to drive the fuck off."
"""That's what you telling me, right?"
"""Okay, well, let me tell you something, Abu."
"""That's right."
"I said it, Abu."
"""You just live here."
I run shit here!
"King Kong ain't got shit on me!"""
He just ran the light.
He ain't want nothing to do with it.
Then leave the rest of the world for me.
"What, Muraaki?"
Can you only fight?
Only the one who can fight can love.
Can fight for love.
Can die for love.
What is going to happen tonight?
Is the sky going crazy?
Don't question nature.
This is happening..
..because you are about to belong to me forever and forever.
Such a ferocious storm happens only once in a thousand years.
There will be only one Saiba and Jilaan in a thousand years.
The moon shall yield a sword.
You are the moon and I am a dark night.
How did I get so attached to you?
Trust your heart.
Does your heart beat to my name?
How would it?
Muraakis don't possess a heart.
Saiba belongs to me.
And she shall always belong to me.
I had said so.
You shall die in Paathar's waters.
So Muraakis don't possess a heart?
We gave you a heart and then stabbed it.
We killed you with deceit.
Saiba did.
"No trust, no love."
"Don't commit this sin, Kaabir."
Don't.
It is no sin to kill for love.
"- Yuck, Steso, why do you get those?"
- The pills are best when injected.
The physical and psychological agents are fluid.
"They add corn starch, parafin and calcium to solidify it."
- That's what gives you boils.
- You're gross!
- What are the dogs called?
- Chill and Ace.
- For chillum and acid?
- Right.
"- Very ingenious, Asger."
- Right.
- And yet so sad.
- Why?
- Are your dogs ill?
- I don't know.
Maybe it's the pig.
"They're in the bedroom or outside, till I've finished this."
"The dogs are used to the hash fumes, and suddenly you kick them out."
So they feel bad.
"Withdrawal symptoms, you know."
- What are you talking about?
- They're junkie dogs.
They are not junkie dogs!
They have a pedigree...
- Like you.
Your dogs are like you.
- I'm not a fucking junkie.
- You don't know what you are.
Stop it now!
- I have to go now.
- My dogs aren't junkie dogs!
The Association sent him up to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
"You don't understand what's going on, do you?"
"No, I can't say as I do."
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
"Whiskey, George."
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
"- It's all right, Charles."
- Let's get started.
"- What'll I need, Joe?"
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
"Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?"
"- You mean, will he kill you?"
- Yes.
"I'm not going to let that happen, Charles."
A man like that you don't want to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest... and a German automatic over there in the drawer... one of the new ones.
- Say some things you don't like.
- Shut up.
- I'm bored!
"- Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill.
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
Makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
"That's the undercover's wife, Caroline Risdale."
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her but there's only thing that comes before a lady.
Me dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
"I'll get us something to eat, then we can work in shifts."
- Why?
- Because I may garrotte you myself.
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
- What kind of bag?
- I dunno.
A bag bag.
"- A suitcase, an overnight bag...?"
- That's it.
An overnight bag.
He goes out for a jog like you said and... he comes back out with a bag.
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
- Did he see you?
The bastards who did this should be shot.
"No, I tried to get away and I lost control."
You did everything you could.
"Don't worry, the cops will get these guys."
- Have you seen Grace?
- She looks good.
- They think she's gonna be okay.
- Really?
We still have to run a few tests.
"Everything looks good, but as soon as I can, I'll bring her down so you can be with her."
"Okay, thanks."
I'm gonna go back and stay with Grace until they're ready to bring her in here.
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Your husband seems like a great guy.
"It's okay, Judy."
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.
"Okay, well, the Venus flytrap is nontoxic, so it's not lethal if ingested."
"However, the larger ones are extremely dangerous, and have been known to devour pets and small children."
"No, no, no, I made that last part up."
Uh...
I'm sorry.
"Ma'am, I..."
You're absolutely right.
This is not a venue for humor.
I...
I understand.
I-I apologize.
"You, too."
Do you need any help with the snakes?
So gossip girl most likely goes to or went to constance.
Yeah exactly. why else the focus?
"Well,i would also assume that she is our age."
The blasts all started when we were in the ninth grade.
An upperclassman simply wouldn't care.
"So you're saying gossip girl's a senior,like us?"
"Well,if she's a senior"
Then--then that means she's in the room right now.
So who could it be?
Rebecca sherman?
no her head's always in a book.
- She's not paying enough attention.
- Okay.
Not her either.
Then i submit nelly yuki.
Low profile
Good with computers...
Many grudges mostly against me.
No i have been with her way too many times
When gossip girl has sent out a blast.
There's no way it's her. i'm gonna speed this up.
What are you doing?
sending a tip to gossip girl.
"- Chuck,get the room quiet for me. - i'm way ahead of you."
If i could have everyone's attention please.
We'd like to thank you all for being here today.
Jonathan?
what?
Gossip girl is... a guy?
It's him. look.
What just happened?
What's going on?
Go for it.
Jeremy.
Jenna.
"Hey, what's, uh?"
- What's up?
- Regret.
Make sure you lock that up.
Did I just pass their driveway?
"Uh, I think it's up there."
This is an amazing car.
Did I pass?
- Um...
- The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
I don't know.
"You were reminiscing about the Elena years all night, so..."
"Caroline, that stuff came before, okay?"
It's not just gonna go away.
"- I know that, okay?"
- No.
"No, you don't."
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
"Look, it's my fault."
"I, you know..."
I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me.
"But all that talk, it was just two old friends and some memories."
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
I was there because I wanted to be with you.
And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you're the only person I want to be in this car with right now.
I don't even know if this makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself...
"No, no."
I think you're doing just fine.
Ow!
Hold this.
"If you find life so valuable, why not give a murderer what he deserves?"
For whom?
Who asked for this?
Arie.
-Arie hasn't asked anything.
It's us who wanted revenge.
-You owe it to your children.
They're 6 and 8 years old.
How does it benefit them if we kill a 60 year old man?
To warn them.
"When they'll be 30, they'll make their own stupid mistakes."
Because we set a bad example.
We have to get the ones who weren't caught.
And who will we bring back to life again by doing that?
Arie?
If we don't tell them that murder never pays... they won't learn anything from our war.
They don't want to learn from our war.
The only thing history teaches us is that we don't learn from it.
I want that!
"-No, me!"
Let me introduce my wife.
This is an old friend of mine.
Ab Spoelstra.
He suddenly dropped in.
I'm Tine.
-I'm Ab.
So sweet that you've already prepared everything.
They love a game of bite the cake.
"You'll stay here, won't you, Cees?"
They're counting on you.
He's so good with the children.
I expect to be able to see the sea.
You can see the sea.
It's over there between the land and the sky.
I need a telescope to see that.
"Well, may I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea?"
Or preferably in it?
Right.
"Now, listen to me."
"I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here."
"However, I shall expect a reduction."
"Why, because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?"
"Because the room is cold, the bath is too small, the view is invisible, and the radio doesn't work."
"No, the radio works."
You don't.
What?
"I'll see if I can fix it, you scabby old bat."
- I think we got something then.
- What?
I think we got something then!
What are you doing?
Qué?
"Madam, don't think me rude, but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?"
A what?
A hearing aid!
"Yes, I do have a hearing aid."
Would you like me to get it mended?
!
Mended?
It's working perfectly all right.
"No, it isn't!"
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.
- Why not?
What's up?
I don't know.
Sounds kind of phony to me.
"Hello, is that you, Sam?"
Thompson.
"Say, uh, Sam, I just had a long-distance from Gargan."
"Yeah, he sounded kind of funny."
Is there anything wrong?
Is there anything wrong?
"Oh, not very much."
Only Gargan put a bullet into one of his monkeys.
What?
Sure.
"And from the dope I get, he's hiding out."
And they're trying to keep it quiet.
"But if the guy dies, you'll never see that deputy again."
Out of the state on business.
A conference with the governor.
Giving me orders.
"Why, that dirty, little crook."
"When I go to the penitentiary, I'll throw peanuts at him."
- What did he do?
- Nothing.
"He just put a bullet in somebody, that's all."
And he has the gall to--
Let me look at those accounts for the last two months.
We're going to make up for lost time.
You ain't on the level about me going back to that hospital again.
"- Yeah, get back there."
- But I've been there 40 times.
Forty more.
"After two weeks, they don't know if the guy will live or not."
"I was wearing a brown tie last night, not a red one."
This was a red one with a little figure on it.
I don't own such a--
Wait a minute.
- Was the figure sort of gray?
- That's right.
I think that's one of the ones I left at the office.
"Sure, that's it."
"You know, in case-- in case I lined up something kind of special."
"At the office, where anyone might have taken it?"
Yeah.
I mean no.
"A couple of months ago,"
Sandy spilled some soup and-- that's it.
That's the tie I loaned to Sandy.
"Beth, I have to see him."
Everything points in one direction.
Now if you want me to help your husband before the police get here--
"Perry, I don't know what I want-- just time to think, please."
"Beth, stop that sniveling."
You don't have to pretend to be loyal.
"Mr. Sandover, you went out to Lita Krail's cottage last night, didn't you?"
She lied to me.
She was up to something;
trying to get you into trouble.
She said she'd meet me in Phoenix.
She lied to me.
I bought a new sport coat.
I told her things-- things I never told anyone.
You thought she cared for you.
"What did she do, laugh at you?"
I didn't give her the chance.
"Is there some new event, some change?"
No.
No.
I just thought...
"You've just been drinking to calm your nerves, huh?"
"It is your nerves, isn't it?"
Perhaps you should see a doctor.
No.
"No, I don't need a doctor."
"Would you like to have some wine, sir?"
I'll get you another glass.
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
"Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll."
- Is he?
- Yes.
Yes.
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.
Yes.
Yes.
"""A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir wouldn't be knowing such a person."" No."
"""I ain't such a bad looker, sir, when I'm more myself. "" Yes."
"He's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he?"
"A sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe."
"He's a smug, hypocritical coward, that's what he is!"
- You couldn't know him!
- I know him intimately.
And I detest him intimately from his lofty brain to the soles of his virtuous feet!
"And you, you..."
"""I'll do anything you ask, sir."""
"Well, you saw him, didn't you?"
You saw the respectable fool.
Do you know anything about this?
Yes.
I know all about it.
"You could say I killed him, I suppose."
"If he'd never met me, he might still be alive."
He was the most hated man on earth.
But he could have been one of the great men of the world.
He had a big mind.
When they talk about him they'll be talking about a giant.
A genius.
Some people called him an evil genius.
Go on.
He lifted me out of the gutter.
He made me somebody.
He was the only man I ever loved.
I was only really happy when I was with him.
Could you tell us anything about his activities?
Well...
He started his career only a few years ago in Europe.
It doesn't seem possible.
He could have accomplished so much... in such a short time.
Clementi.
"Well, aren't you going to ask me in?"
What are you staring at?
Is this the way a man greets his own brother?
They told me you had died in that concentration camp.
Who told you that?
Everyone who came back.
So I came back from the dead.
Where's mother?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
"If my guess is right, his next victim is here amongst us."
- Who?
- You only!
"You gave an interview to TV9 channel, right?"
Is there any rule that your guess will come true?
He took charge and shot him.
Check thoroughly and kill without missing him.
"All your search is in vain, because I'm his next target."
He'll definitely come for me.
"I shot a bullet into him, right?"
He likes challenge.
He'll definitely counter attack me.
"Somebody gave this for you, sir."
"I'm going to rob Rs.20 crores from him in an hour, be ware!"
"We have an hour only, we must find who is he."
Inform all TV channels.
Fast!
Who is he?
Doctor?
Politician?
Who are you man?
I'm a peon in Revenue office.
Remember that while doing your duty.
It seems you refused to do household work.
Why are you so proud?
"Sir, madam..."
"Don't talk, go get me a tea."
Rs.20 crores?
!
Who is the mad man to say that?
"We don't have time, tell us the truth."
"I beg you sir, please leave me."
He was so worried about losing more hair with chemo treatments I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease?
- You did that?
- Yeah!
"- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy."
- Wait!
You can't say anything.
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.
"Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for nothing."
So because you're getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer?
Yeah.
"Well, I don't like it."
I don't like it one bit.
And I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
Maintain the same disposition.
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!
Gary?
What do you think?
Check it out.
- Is that from my gift certificate?
"- Yeah, buddy."
You came through.
You've been so nice.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage."
Yeah.
"Hey, know what I'm thinking of doing?"
I'm getting rid of all my fillings because that mercury's toxic.
And second of all?
"Oh, I didn't have a second of all."
"I was hoping ""second of all"" would make me feel better."
Second of all I can't stop thinking about you either.
[ANNA LAUGHS]
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
We hardly know each other.
I don't know.
"I mean, look at Becca."
"You know, my sister's friend."
"One guy waits on her at Bennigan's and by the end of the meal, they both knew they had found the one."
You're right.
You're totally right.
"I mean, it could happen, right?"
Not for me.
What about texter?
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.
"I mean, this guy could've had surgery, leaving him without a voice box breathing through a stoma and I would never know because I've never actually heard his voice."
"Well, I doubt he has a stoma."
MARY:
That's not the point.
I can't text.
"You know, I'm not charming via text."
ANNA:
Maybe you should just stop texting.
"But it's not just texting, it's e-mail."
It's voicemail.
It's snail mail.
That's regular mail.
Whatever.
How'd you know?
Wait a minute.
Freeze it.
And run that guy.
What are you lookin' at?
Nothin'.
"I need the, um, name and address of anyone... that's been fired or quit our chip manufacturer in the last 30 days."
Acme?
"Yeah, that would be the name."
Do it.
Why did you tell the Indian girl to delay the revenue report?
Her name is Sarasvati.
And unfortunately we had to fix a glitch... in our asset management ratio analysis program.
Or it would have put our activity-based costing system off by three or four percent.
"Well, we wouldn't want that to happen, now would we?"
"Next time, check with me first."
"Okay, Eddie?"
"""Eddie."""
Unbelievable.
What?
This is a betting slip that guy used to pay me.
It's a winner.
It's a five-team parlay.
"- My man, you just won 2,000 bucks."
- Two thousand bucks!
Two thousand bucks!
- Nice.
- That'll teach that guy to go light on me.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Wait.
Whoa.
You think I should cash this in?
"Far as I could tell, you just keep your goddamn mouth shut unless you're opening it to pour booze in."
And you cheat on your wife.
"That's all i knew about after, you asshole."
You goddamn son of a bitch.
"Goddamn teddy, vietnam."
"Goddamn million gooks dead, 50,000 americans."
Goddamn won the war.
What did he do when he came home?
After?
"Drink, fight, cheat on his wife."
I ain't no goddamn coward.
"I got goddamn medals out the ass, asshole."
Proves I'm a hero.
"God, bombs going off, buildings coming down."
I know exactly what to do.
"If it happened right now, if this bar blew up, I'd know exactly what to do."
"Kids, marriage."
That's where--that's where I suck.
That's where I really suck.
That shit... that scares the balls off of me.
"Here I am after, surrounded by booze and dead assholes."
Thanks.
Get up slow.
Ok.
This is how it's gonna go.
You're gonna take that bag of cash I saw earlier.
Yeah.
You're gonna hand it over to me.
"And if you so much as twitch a muscle while you're doing it,"
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.
- Capiche?
- Ok.
But you've got an off switch.
Do you have any idea how terrible that is?
"I know, i didn't say i was proud."
"You wanted to know, so i'm telling you."
Why did i stay?
What did you do to me?
"You just kept wanting to find dylan, look for dylan."
"I couldn't get past it, couldn't make any progress,"
"And then one day, it occurs to me."
"What if... instead of trying to fight your memories,"
"I make you someone else,"
Let the core al work against itself.
"The nightmares... my core al, trying to reconcile conflicting data."
It's a subconscious do-Loop.
We've all got them.
"It's a stroke of genius, really."
It makes you more human.
But you have no right to turn me into something-
Someone i'm not.
I know.
I just... i just wanted rommie back.
I just wanted my old life back.
"Well, argent knows whereandromedais,"
And i want to go there.
He says dylan is there.
"No way, uh-Uh."
"You, dylan, and theandromedatogether?"
Bad idea.
"But you'd like that, yes?"
"To see your old ship, your friends."
Do i sound like i'd like it?
"Tempting, but no thanks."
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.
"Let me back in there so I can bash him on the nose, that's all!"
"Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?"
Always ready to flare up.
"Oh, I like that."
"Here, here."
This is just to prove that I want to help you.
"The rainbow is wide and long, lvy."
"- Oh, now wait."
I better get home.
"- No, no, no."
"Ivy, my darling, you belong with the immortals."
Come with me to Mount Olympus.
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.
And put Athena and Diana to shame.
"Oh, you aren't half of one with the words, aren't you?"
"And don't be frightened of me, will you, lvy?"
"When a botanist finds a rare flower, he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?"
Are you one of them?
"You like a man who sees a girl and makes up his mind, don't you?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, she doesn't know what I'm talking about."
"- Please, sir."
"- But you'll find out, won't you?"
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.
"Please, sir."
"The London Post, Sir Charles."
"Oh, thank you."
"And one for you, mademoiselle."
"This band not only wants to re-invent the wheel, but wants to pound spikes into it, as well."
- She's awfull.
- Yeah monkey face.
"It would be disastrous, and would cause irrecoverable damages to"
Utah's women and children.
"Hi, we're at Nine Inch Nails !"
Fuck you.
- He's tellin' me there's no god !
"- There's no heaven, there's no hell."
All you are is fucking worm food.
Might as well face that shit right now.
"The only reason human beings created god, god did not create man, man created god."
I just scored front row tickets.
- Really?
"- Hello, my life is good."
Woo !
He keeps saying :
"""I'm gonna be in Trent's jock strap."""
"""I'm gonna be in his underwear."""
You know what my dream is?
"I'm gonna lick trent when he comes down into the audience, and he will."
- I'm not a big nine inch nails fan.
- That's ok.
But i wouldn't mind licking him.
"Keep him, away."
"Hey God,"
Why are you doing this to me?
"Am i not living up, to what i'm supposed to be?"
Why am i seething with this animosity?
"Hey God, i think you owe me a great big apology."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Yep.
"They'd find the magnet, you'd be the first and only suspect, so you framed us."
Do you have any idea what you did to this man?
This man has nothing.
His...
His wife left him.
His girlfriend is in jail.
And he's been living in a ratty little condo.
"Thank you, Randy."
He's been looking at a sad little picture of a boat on a wall for 11 years...
Randy.
"...and you gave him hope, and then, you ripped his heart out."
Randy.
"For that, you're going to burn in hell."
That and the homicide.
"Actually, two homicides."
Don't forget the lottery fanatic who had a picture of them both together.
I think we're done here.
You two are under arrest.
Stand up.
"Let me see your hands, hotshot."
Thank you.
"Glad you like numbers, Billy."
You're going to be wearing some numbers on your shirt.
Is that right?
They won't be lottery numbers.
I get it.
Because you're going to prison.
"Yeah, I get it."
You have the right to remain silent.
I will if you will.
"You miss it, don't you?"
"It just wants something to eat, and then it's going to leave."
"Let's just make a path of chips to the window so it can get out, but we can't feed it anything too nice or else we will never be able to get rid of it."
"Okay, well, that was my mistake with you."
"Well, hello there."
"Mr. Squirrel, I know exactly how you feel."
I hate people too.
Come on.
Come on.
I've been in the same situation.
"Stuck in a strange guy's bedroom, just looking for some nuts."
Come on.
Come on.
Dude.
Bam.
"Oh, my God, that was awesome."
How did you know how to do that?
I was raised on a lot of cartoons.
"Who was the guys, the, um..."
The...
"Chucky, and Bucky."
Bucky?
Who?
"Chuck... no, Chuck, and the guy with the, the, the..."
Are you talking about rocky and Bullwinkle?
Yes.
Do you know them?
They were basically my parents.
"Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting you were raised in the wild."
"Well, not actually that you were raised in the wild, but more that you were, just, kind of not raised at all."
"But, uh, hey, this is the first time it came in handy."
I don't know what to tell you.
You fell in love with a hood rat.
I'll lock it up in my safe.
Give me the pen.
"Now, get out and leave a man to work."
"No, Lucas."
You get out.
- You get out of Peyton Place before dark.
"- Doc, I signed it for you!"
"If you do, I'll keep this in my safe."
"But if you don't, I'll use it against you."
I signed it!
Don't you ever try to come back here.
"Not next week, not next year, not ever."
"If you do, I'll kill you myself."
Why you little... .
Mary.
"Unofficially, this was a miscarriage but officially, for the records, it's an appendectomy."
- That's a lie.
- I removed her appendix.
Understand?
You want to ruin a girl's life for one word?
"- No, but falsifying records... ."
- I'll make them out personally and if you tell anybody this wasn't an appendectomy I'll tell the whole town about you and that drug salesman.
"Doc, that's blackmail."
It sure is.
"Nellie, she's all right now."
She's just fine.
Thank God.
"What a disgrace, disgrace!"
- Disgrace!
- Nellie.
Don't talk that way.
Nobody's ever gonna know but the three of us.
- Yes.
My goodness.
I hope you have friends here.
"Well, there's Tom who takes care of the lighthouse and the ferry comes every other Monday with our supplies."
- That's all?
- Yes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What do you do if there's an emergency?
"There's a radio transmitter at Tom's cottage, but that's really more to do with the lighthouse."
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.
"Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married."
That's how he lost his legs.
He was training to be a fighter pilot.
And then after the accident he...
"Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here."
It seemed like a good idea.
It might have been a mistake.
You can't blame him for wanting to run away.
"No, I don't."
It's terribly sad.
"No, it was our fault completely."
We'd had a bit to drink and we were driving much too fast...
- Suddenly there was this lorry...
"No, no."
Haven't the leisure.
"Oh, dear me."
And here I thought...
- I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
"- But I am, doctor."
- Really.
- Maybe I better send you to the hospital?
I will not go down that way.
I choose to fight back!
"I choose to rise, not fall."
"I choose to live, not die."
And I know I know that what's within me is also within you.
That's why I ask you now to join me.
Join me.
Rise up with me.
Rise up on the wings of this slain angel.
We'll rebuild on the soul of this little warrior.
We will pick up his standard and raise it high.
Carry it forward until this city your city our city his city is a palace again!
Is a palace again!
"I am with you, little James."
I am you.
Thank you very much.
Terrible thing to bury a child.
Your trip to Washington.
The stuff for the Convention Committee.
History of New York City for Senator Marquand.
Reservation at the Willard Hotel.
"Lincoln stayed there, by the way."
Enough about me.
Enough about me.
What are you going do tonight after I'm gone?
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.
You're going to get yourself a good meal.
You're going to pass up that double cheeseburger from Roy Rogers.
"You're going to go to Dominic's and get take-out, on me."
Get a decent meal.
"But before you go to Dominic's, go to Macy's and get a chair with legs and arms."
And you to me.
You are.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"The more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
If the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while,"
So...
I thought that...
"So you neglect him most of his life, I'm out of the house a week, and there you are?"
"He surprised me, Dan."
"You know, Nathan's a good kid."
You got him so screwed up he doesn't know what he wants.
"Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?"
Deb's the best thing Nathan's got going for him right now.
- She's trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I'm trying to do?
"I've been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny."
"I don't mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring, but leave the good one alone, would you?"
Hey Peyton.
Missing these?
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with.
She was shaking them like a pom pom.
Maybe she'll be a cheerleader.
Or President.
You gotta think big.
"Alright, you never know."
Whatever makes her happy.
"You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are."
"Well, its really not that hard."
"I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked."
She's just so cute.
And I think about watching her grow up.
I couldn't imagine not being there.
"You know, I bet you're a really great dad."
I don't know.
Some days I wonder.
Hey Nathan.
Hey.
Missed you at practice.
"You know, I have a friend he's been an honest man all his life but it didn't get him anywhere."
So he decided to join forces with the devil.
He said that the devil would watch over him and protect him.
And what happened to him?
"Oh, he's very rich, very prosperous now."
But is he happy?
Supremely.
The race just isn't even when we're born.
Some people a head start.
All you have to do is run a little faster than the next fellow.
With the devil at your side.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Oh, ""S"" is over there."
I didn't get your name.
Clementi Sabourin.
Have my card.
I'm Wilson of Wilson Oil of Canada.
Thank you.
Look me up.
I'll do that.
Please have your luggage ready for customs inspection.
"Check, please, sir."
"Uh, officer."
"Yes, sir?"
I seem to have lost my wallet.
When did you last have it?
I'm sure I had it when I was standing here in line.
Was there anyone near you?
There was a man standing there?
Which direction did he go?
"I think he went out that way, but..."
I'm not sure that he took it.
Her dad will give them both a lift in I imagine.
"Now, I've actually got some herbal tea here, if you prefer."
-Lemon and ginger?
"-Actually, yes, I will."
Thanks.
And... that was all very lovely tonight.
"Thank you, very much."
It's no problem.
This morning's teacup.
You must be feeling better.
And a whole basket of laundry still waiting to go in.
-You'll be running out of sheets.
-Do you mind?
Thanks.
Yeah.
And I know that Julie's really appreciated you being around these last couple of weeks.
"-I think there's quite a lot of you in her, actually."
"-Oh, dear."
The poor girl.
"No, it's...."
"What I was trying to say earlier on that... now I feel, I suppose, released in a way."
From Phillipa.
It's....
"This is gonna sound so callous, calculated, it's not meant to be."
I know.
It's very hard sometimes.
"You know, when you just wake up one day... and suddenly find you have feelings for someone you never even knew were there."
"You don't plan it or legislate for it, it's just...."
"-Oh, God."
-Do you know what I mean?
I think I do.
"You do, don't you, Alice?"
"You and your partner were having a beer, trying to unwind, and this jackass..."
"Uh, Joe Penn comes over and starts mouthing off."
"Maybe it was about the Cubs, maybe it was about Chicago's new mayor, I don't know."
"But this Joe Penn crossed a line somehow, and you felt you needed to step in and deal with it."
Or not.
"If I'm anywhere close, just grunt."
Read my report.
"Lee says he and Taggot had been there about an hour, had a couple of beers, were about to leave when this Joe Penn got into a fight with another patron."
He and Taggot stepped in to break it up.
How'd you do?
"Yeah, that's pretty much what Taggot said."
"Hey, Sis."
I'll just be a minute.
"Donny, Steve."
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be out busting bad guys?
The shift doesn't start till 11:00.
"Yeah, but this isn't your station."
Why are you acting weirder than usual?
- I'm not.
"- Yes, you are."
"- Yeah, you really are."
- Way beyond your normal weird.
"Well, I'm just surprised to see you guys here, that's all."
So why are you here?
To wish Sean Dunn good luck.
We talked about this last night.
It's his last day.
He's moving to Tampa.
Is any of this ringing a bell for you?
Right.
I'm working now!
You keep yelling at me day and night
And to think you're my dad?
"Look at you, are you a thief at night?"
Thief?
"If so, need I stay here... and work like a horse?"
What are you mumbling about?
What did you say?
Nothing!
If you don't like it here... you're free to leave
"Boss, look at your restaurant"
It's as big as a market.
I'm the only staff here
It wouldn't hurt to hire one more helper
What did you say?
Who's gonna pay for that?
You're so ungrateful!
If it wasn't me who pitied you last year...
"And keep you here, you'd have starved to death"
"Y es, oh yes!"
Thanks Mr. Boss!
Work fast!
"Can't take any criticism, even talks back to me"
Did you light the stove yet?
Light the stove?
You lazy bum!
I woke you up... to have you light the stove!
You're so forgetful!
I'll beat you up!
"You good-for-nothing, how dare you run!"
"I'll beat you up, you can't remember a thing!"
Where is he?
"Everyone has someone except for me, you know?"
"Okay, well, I thought you weren't ready for that."
"Well, I wasn't, but I..."
I don't know.
- Maybe I am.
"- Well, if we had to verbally abuse some game night guests for you to figure that out, then that is totally okay."
"And, just so you know, if you wanna get out there, all I have to do is put out an APB."
- Let me handle this one.
- I'll probably get involved.
Why don't you get involved with Mark's peen.
"No, 'cause guess what?"
"This is 40, okay?"
"Do you really think, when you take your clothes off, that he's gonna run the other way?"
"No, he's gonna jump on you like an old hound dog."
What if I just wear Spanx during sex?
What do you think?
"Mark, I wanna rock your body all night long in so many different ways."
"Not right now, we're watching ""Happy Feet."""
"- Dave, hit the road."
"- Dave, you gotta go."
- Really?
- You gotta go.
"Ugh, I wish I had somebody to rock my body."
"You will again, man."
You will again.
See you later.
"- Mark, I am so sorry."
"- No, I'm sorry, right?"
The warm banana?
What is that?
"- No, I loved that."
"- And then I snuck into your house, ""Dawson's Creek"" style."
Okay.
Sure.
Thanks.
See that?
"What do you got to say now, huh?"
I'm just glad everyone's away during all of this.
- What if she wins?
- She won't.
What if...
You saw that report.
It's claiming you're an absentee parent.
"I know, I know."
It's gonna make it worse if you and I...
If we don't figure things out.
"Yeah, uh..."
"I think, just for now, we have to put our personal issues aside and just create a united front."
"You know, for Georgie's sake."
Just for Georgie's sake?
"No... for us, too."
Kind of a weird day.
"I guess it's becoming a habit for you, this getting arrested thing."
Come on...
I wasn't arrested after that bar episode.
You and Caleb were such a mess.
Ty... why didn't you call?
"You know, after..."
I picked you up and everything?
"I wanted to, but I decided to give you some time to figure out what it is that you want."
"What I wanted was to talk, but..."
you made it pretty clear that you didn't.
"You kept giving me the cold shoulder, and then, this morning, you do a complete 180."
"You kissed me, Ty."
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please.
So the guy was choked to death.
"You sure, Doc?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Not only that, it appears it was done with one hand... someone"
With a very strong right hand.
So you're saying that he was choked
By a guy using just one hand?
Yeah.
"There was severe damage to the larynx, the esophagus."
There's no doubt it was strangulation.
That doesn't make sense.
"Broad daylight, no robbery."
"And if there was an assault, why didn't the dog bark?"
I can't solve the case.
I can only tell you how the young man died.
"Not a single person heard a damn thing,"
And yet there were people all around.
"Hey, Doc."
Is it possible that... that a girl could have strangled him?
"On, the top my head I'd say no."
The hand print on his throat was too large for most women.
And I doubt if any woman would have that much strength.
Why do you ask?
"Oh, hell, I'm grasping at anything, Doc."
"I mean, he was with a girl."
It was her dog.
I think they should reduce the working hours.
"Eight hours a day, instead of the current ten."
They only pay us 7000 FM a month.
"The people that work eight hours a day are paid better... than us, that's the real problem."
So what do you want us to do?
I think people are spoiled here.
Did you hear?
"After the first month, everyone's in debt."
You have to claim your rights.
"Besides, there's tattletales among us."
"They keep quiet now, and talk later."
"Instead of insulting each other, let's reach an agreement."
"In any case, we need to earn more."
- Speak up!
"- Traoré, a call for you."
- I'm at a meeting.
- It's very urgent.
- What do you want?
- It's not my problem.
"Instead of talking, let's act."
How?
- Let's go and see the boss!
- We've already seen him.
Let's go once more.
"And if he doesn't see us, we stop working."
"Traoré, the boss is calling."
"Doumbia, carry on with the meeting, I'll be right back."
You know what we have to do.
Traoré will be back.
Wait for him.
Let me go!
Where were you when my fur order arrived?
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia Among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say,"
"But I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
"He's the only one I can leave my Uh, my bankruptcy to."
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
- [car rattling] - what...
What's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to..."
He's still sleeping.
What?
He's still here?
"All right,look,I did something really stupid."
"If you did something bad to Augie,don't tell me."
"I love you,but he's been my best friend for 15 years."
"No,it's not that, but thank you,by the way."
There's a hierarchy.
I'm sorry.
"Alright,look,this is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life."
Really?
'Cause...
Oh!
What is that?
"Bella,I swear to God,if you laugh..."
"Ser... seriously,what the hell is that?"
- It's a merkin.
- Is it alive?
How do you not know what a merkin is?
It's like a toupee for down there.
How would I know that?
"Is it the next link in the chain of crazy, wax-it-all-off-and-stick- something-else on?"
"It's from,like,a zillion years ago when prostitutes would have to shave everything off so they wouldn't get lice."
"That one's a reproduction,right?"
Are you gonna help me or not?
"What do you want me to do,braid it?"
I can't get it off.
"Oh,sweetie..."
"I accidentally put it on sideways, and,and now I can't get it off, and I have a Ted Koppel."
"Oh,sweetie,come here."
Don't worry.
We'll take care of you.
"- I'm going to stand up for our rights, at least, in the matter of the fence."
Wouldn't it be easier just to mend it?
"I mean-- no, I'm making a stand on principle, James."
"You will back me up, won't you?"
- Leave me out of it.
"For one thing, I'm not up to it."
For another-- all right.
Be like that.
Wallow in defeatism.
What is that disgusting smell?
Helen swears it's a sovereign remedy for flu.
It smells like old socks.
"- Don't insult old socks, this stuff's in a class of its own."
"- What is, darling?"
I was just praising the remarkable qualities of your flu remedy.
"Oh, were you?"
"Come along, drink it up while it's hot."
Got to get you fit again.
"'Night, tris."
"Next, please!"
"Come on, digger."
"- Andrew, come on in."
"James, you don't sound too good."
"No, I'm fine."
"Spot of flu, but Helen's specific knocked it on the head."
"Let's have a look at him, shall we?"
Come on.
"Come, digger."
Mr. herriot just wants to look.
When did you first notice this problem?
"He's had eye trouble on and off since he was a pup, really."
"Could you hold his head, please?"
- That was you!
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"To-To hook up with a girl, I have to connect with her at least a little."
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings... or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me... with the subject line ""Food for Thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
Now turn off the lights and go.
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
- Guys?
"- Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be.
- What is going on with you guys?
- It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction... and a beat-up van I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Now, Stu's over at the Bullfrog."
What's he doin'?
"Well, you know what he's doing."
Is he looking for gold?
"Well, wouldn't be too far off."
No gold over there.
"Okay, tell people that."
"That's a good story, you keep telling people that."
Hasn't been any gold over there for 60 years.
"I watched your dad work that worthless hole for 50 years, and all he come out of there with was a sore back."
There's no gold over there.
"Okay, that's-- that's a good story, Perry."
Tell 'em forget about the gold and go for clip and save.
Do you use clip and save?
No.
"You don't use this stuff because you're on the county payroll, right?"
You don't need to.
But some of us are finding it a little hard to get by these days.
This is a good one.
You can get 75 cents off on a six-pack.
You spend much time around Greenwater Gulley?
No.
Not since I was a kid.
"You know, Earl and I pulled an RV out of there this afternoon."
mm-hmm?
"Three people in it, cut up."
Just like them others we found over the years.
[sighs]
I don't understand.
Some lunatic running around here.
It makes me sick.
"Look at these prices-- 35, 20, 35."
I mean literally I could just kill her.
Okay.
You know how I'd do it?
Rip out her tongue and I'd wrap her own tongue around her freaking neck until she was dead.
Do you know what?
That would be funny.
That would be funny.
You know why?
Because then she couldn't shoot her flipping mouth off and she'd be dead.
And I would win because she's dead!
I added echo for effect.
I like sound.
Now look at the timecode.
"It's the time of the murder, damn!"
This is the first time that someone saying they want to kill someone was their alibi.
Grrr!
Shaye.
"You know,"
"I do what I do, check one two."
Check one two.
"Well, this is the big day."
I'll be witness for the prosecution.
Somebody's ears are going to be burning
"Because I'll be talking about you, testifying about you."
Some say I'll even be lying about you.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want me to tell the truth no matter what?
Then everyone'll know our personal business.
They'll never understand.
What?
I...
I suppose I could do it just for us.
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
DAVID:
"Fuck. lf anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air... (david panting) I couldn't take the shot."
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
katherine:
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"-No, he couldn't."
"-What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
I'm the sheriff.
It's my business to know such things.
"Besides, this road only goes to one place."
"Now, you folks have a good time down there, you hear?"
- Thank you.
- This'll be cleared up in no time.
Great.
"Thanks, sheriff."
[Mike] Thanks a lot.
"Come on, Bills."
"He's back at it again, Perry."
That girl's cut the same way as those two last year.
"Earl, why don't you just haul this stuff to town and stop playing coroner?"
You know it's the same.
You ain't no closer to catching him now than you was then.
I know.
But your blabbing about it ain't going to do nothing except maybe scare folks around town half to death.
"Now, will you get that stuff out of there?"
I got something I got to do.
"You're too old for this job, Sheriff."
"[chattering, laughing]"
"Hey, Billy, how about it, huh?"
"Sure, Mom."
Hold it.
"Draw, sidewinder, or I'll kill you where you stand."
You got your iron there.
"You better pull it, or I'm going to blow you apart."
[cap pistol fires]
[laughs]
Got to watch out for these varmints.
"Thanks, Sheriff."
"Hey, that's great."
"Some celebration, or what?"
"It's my lucky day today, dear witch."
Let's hope it's not the last.
Now nothing can prevent her from making the right choice
Me!
Me!
Me...!
"That's fine, but your star is waning!"
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
Tomorrow is the third full moon.
I can talk and talk and nobody listens to me.
- Nobody believes me.
- Nor me.
But he brought the kerchief that I gave Henry.
How else would he have got it?
"I don't know yet, but we'll find out."
"It's not working, or something."
D'you know why?
Because you're a muddle-pate!
Let go or I'll hit you.
So how did she do it?
I don't know!
"So tell your girl-friend to show you and fast, or Elisa'll die of woe."
We want Elise to see Henry alive and stop dripping tears into the dough.
"Here you are, and make it quick."
"I went to her three times, you know what she said?"
Patience brings roses.
What would I do with roses?
Johann.
Looks nice.
"Is it noon already, Johann?"
"Not yet, but I can't wait."
"Snap your fingers, you're dead."
We see that every day.
And those people never have time to untangle the knots.
They never have time to prepare themselves.
And so?
And so... the role of the Messengers is to give those people too a chance to be reconciled.
"- ""The Messengers?"""
- Yes.
I don't understand.
There are people out there who know in advance that someone is going to die.
Let's say they...
"""got the message."""
"And in those cases, their job is to help that person depart in peace... reconcile."
"- And you're one of these ""Messengers?"""
"- Yes, I am."
- You know who's going to die?
- Yes.
- You see it?
"- Yes, I see it."
And you help them depart in peace.
"Nathan, I realize it may be hard to believe..."
But Dennis didn't depart in peace.
- No.
- Why?
We don't always succeed.
Sometimes we get there too late.
No one has power over the hour of death.
No one.
I don't believe you.
"Have it your way, Nathan."
But these things can still exist whether you believe in them or not.
I know when someone's going to die...
Your dad is a police officer...
You shouldn't say that.
Then why are you running away?
- Come here.
- Let go of me.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry that I'm a day late.
This... is that watch that high school students like these days.
Tell me now.
Did you kill someone or not?
I didn't.
Soo Bin...
"Your father is... is trying to catch a really bad guy, and that's why he's hiding right now."
"If you were five years younger, that's how I would have explained it."
Um...
I still don't know how I should explain it.
But you'll still...
"believe in me, won't you?"
I told you... that I want to make this a better world for you.
Then are you saying that I was the one who was wrong?
I'm not saying that.
"I'm telling you to believe in me, Soo Bin."
I'm asking you to believe in me.
We're family.
We know each other better than anybody knows anybody.
You shouldn't have run away if you did nothing wrong!
Okay.
That was... my mistake.
"Well, I have to go now."
There were times when...
I... didn't believe in you.
So I'm reflecting on that.
"Growing up in the kellys' House,"
"You know, we had good times And we had bad times."
But what makes a family.
Is if they stick together Through thick and thin.
"You know, my brother's Always been with me."
"We're a great team, Great combination."
- Whoo!
- Batman and robin.
"You know, he's robin, of Course."
"Whoo, yeah!"
"You know, my dad Doesn't expect me to succeed."
"And I just need to prove There's money here,"
And this is all gonna work out.
They just need To trust me a little bit.
Maybe that's not a path.
There's the path.
Get on that.
"Hey, Stop for a second."
- Right here?
- Yeah.
"Okay, this is it."
"All the what up there, A couple of miles."
"And all the way down there, One or two miles."
"J.J., I really love Your adventures, man,"
But you know this one's In the middle of nowhere.
"Even when you're at the bottom, There's only way place to go."
And that's up.
So I can't do any worse Than from right here.
It's only gonna get better.
"I kind of, you know, Expecting to show up here,"
"We drive the bank, And we jump right in the water."
We're gonna make this River mining thing work.
Vanderbilt is a sporting gentleman.
I'll bet right now he'd be willing to settle for half of those millions of his you got tucked away in that safe.
That's a righteous thought!
I ain't greedy.
I'm willing to go over to new york and bargain with cornele if you'll give me a guard.
I'll give you a guard to keep you here.
Huh!
"If you and vanderbilt ever set down to those millions, there'll be mighty slim pickin's for nick and me."
Front wheel!
Back wheel!
1486
Right dress!
"Uh, undress!"
"No, no!"
Dress!
Left by right!
Right by left!
Fix bayonets!
Charge!
Army... help!
"I got 'em stopped, colonel, but they just don't look quite right."
"Well, just tell 'em to fall out."
They'll know what to do.
Fall out.
Fall down!
What good is $10 million if i can't see josie's show open next week?
"Oh, josie will be all right."
"Besides, a trip to europe wouldn't do us any harm."
There'd be plenty of girls over there glad to see us.
Yeah.
And there'll be plenty of fellas in new york glad to see josie.
And i'm not turning my preferred stock over to anybody-you know that.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I...
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
* You got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
* you got the epic mother... *
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
"I'll take the key now, friend."
You are a liar and a cheat and a coward.
Just the key.
Not in the back.
"You can turn around, if you want to."
"I'm just trying to save your life, that's all."
"You kill me, you're gonna protect this half girl, half woman?"
and that boy?
One thing is clear.
"The world has lost a brave, a valiant heart."
"An humble man, a man of small pretensions,"
Boise Peabody's last dying wish was...
Boise Peabody?
"I come to see my brother buried, not the little snake that killed him."
Fill it up.
Wait a minute.
"After the ceremony, all right?"
Fill it up.
Stop!
"Stop, stop!"
The proudest moment of my life.
The whole mining camp turned out to pay their last respects.
You ain't gonna spoil it for me.
"Boise, ain't you dead?"
He is now.
Boise Peabody killed your brother in a fair fight.
"Uh-huh, and now I'm gonna kill him."
He's not armed.
"That's a mistake that you ain't likely to make again now, are you, Boise?"
"Fontana, I won't stand here and watch you murder him."
Just do whatever you like.
Now then.
"- See, I don't get that."
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.
"You kill people, but I see something human in you."
"But with her, there was..."
There was nothing.
You can turn it off.
It's like a button you can press.
"I mean, Stefan's different."
He wants the human experience.
He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother so he shuts his feelings out.
"The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel."
Isobel chose the easier road.
"No guilt, no shame."
No regret.
"I mean, come on."
"If you could turn it off, wouldn't you?"
- You haven't.
"- Of course I have, Ric."
That's why I'm so fun to be around.
Why did you wanna meet me?
It can't be to just catch up.
Because I'm curious about you.
But the real reason is I want what your uncle wants:
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you know my uncle?
I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger.
John had a crush on me for years.
He was the first one that told me about vampires.
"So, what made you wanna be one?"
"It's a very long list of reasons, Elena all of which I'm sure you've thought about."
The earring.
Eric was with a girl alone in this house.
"Oh, boy."
"OK, sweetheart, I will go have a talk with him."
"No, no, no."
I will talk to him.
I don't want to have any of that father-son winking thing going on.
- What father-son winking?
"- No, I-I don't want to see you go,"
"""Son, what you did was wrong,"" and then, ""Attaboy."" I don't want to see that."
- You think I'd do that?
- I think you'd do that.
"Well, I wouldn't do that."
That just goes to show you don't know me at all.
We'll both just go have a talk with my son.
- My son.
- Ugh!
- Hello.
- You want to tell us anything?
Uh... not yet.
Now I got something to tell you.
We found this in our bed.
What was it you wanted to tell us?
"I just wanted to say, ""Happy Birthday, Mom."""
The other one's on layaway.
"Nothing happened between me and Rebecca, if that's what you're thinking."
Why should we believe that nothing happened?
Look at my face.
Do I look happy?
Nothing happened.
"Well, I'd like to know what you were doing bringing a girl into our room."
"And don't give us some lame-o excuse like, ""She wanted a tour of the house."""
"Get it over to Aaron,"
- see what we get.
"- Okay, good."
Ma'am...
When were you going to tell me ?
Excuse me.
Tell you what ?
Last week you were looking at Ray's old case files.
"And now today, a man I thought was locked up for the rest of his life, the man that killed my husband, was murdered."
I'm still working on that.
"You see the way I have this is that if Bob Keaton got out of prison, that tells me he wasn't Ray's killer."
"Horatio, don't lie."
Do you trust me ?
I thought I could.
I need you to trust me until I have something real to tell you.
Okay ?
You promise me ?
Promise ?
Of course.
Hey.
"Alexx, what is that ?"
The shooter left a calling card our competitor missed.
Muzzle stamp.
It was under the mess.
They didn't know to look for it.
"But we did, didn't we ?"
The killer got close for the second shot.
The heat softened Bob's skin.
And then the muzzle smashed into it.
"The muzzle with an imperfection, Alexx."
This demarcation is unique only to the killer's gun.
"So we find that gun, we match it to this imperfection, we have our killer."
Gives you height.
"Say, what all did you buy, Lottie?"
Nothing really.
[sighs] [exclaims]
"Jane, it's for you."
"On second thought, it's too young for you."
Size 10?
I don't get it.
"Well, you will."
"With this, I'm gonna lose pounds like water."
"Wait, I'll show you."
"All this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain gentleman... whose initials are ""Charles Nash""?"
Where do you get your ideas?
[grunts]
"Now, look, this is what you're supposed to do."
"You're supposed to kind of, like, lasso your feet."
Lasso your feet.
"Like that, see."
And then you pull yourself up.
You're bending your knees.
Shut up.
[snickering]
"Well, I'm glad to see you're feeling better, Mrs. Slocum."
How do you do?
May I help you up?
"Well, I'm not feeling better, I'm not well at all."
I just keep trying.
"That's why I'm here, Mrs. Slocum."
I'm gonna ask you to try to remember if there are any details that you overlooked.
"Like what, for instance?"
"Well, supposing we go through the whole thing again."
Right from the start.
It's over.
I got mine.
"Of course, tomorrow you'll have to make up the deliveries you missed today and do your regular route."
Oh.
"Right, sure."
"Well, either way, it'll be nice to have a day with the kids and Frank."
"Well, that's a positive outlook."
Who's Frank?
- He's my...
- Don't care.
Do you have to fucking chew so loud?
Excuse me for having a resonant skull.
Good news!
I don't have to work after all!
We've been handed a gift!
A snow day we can spend together as a family.
"Don't you ""agh"" me."
We are all gonna have fun together at the sled hill!
- Yeah!
- Sledding!
You guys have a good time.
I'm gonna curl up in an afghan and slowly cry myself into a nap.
"No, no."
Uh-uh.
You are going to leave this house and enjoy the day with your family.
I can't.
Pogo might call.
"Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader, but it's been three weeks and Bob Pogo has not called yet."
- And I doubt he'll call today.
"- Your cheerleading needs work, Sue."
"And, if by some miracle he does call, we have an answering machine."
"Come on, you've been a ghost around here since Christmas."
You got an ash tray?
Was she heavy?
Was it hard for them to get her into the dumpster?
"One guy lifted her, the other guy held the top open."
- You see his face?
- Whose face?
You told the other officer you saw the killers face.
I did?
"No, I didn't."
You calling this officer a liar?
I didn't see faces.
I seen the license plate.
"258, right?"
287.
I didn't see the rest of it.
What's the last line on that poster?
"I, I..."
I don't have my glasses.
I was wearing my glasses.
"Y'know, a doctor says to me that I gotta wear my glasses all the time, and, I have to admit, I am sorta vain."
"Well, put your glasses on... and read the bottom line on that poster."
I don't have 'em with me.
"Tell me about the gloves, what were they like?"
"They're white, cotton."
"They got stitching on the back of the hand, along the knuckle."
They're proper ladies gloves.
You can see that kinda detail from your car without your glasses?
I had my glasses.
"When the two guys went away, I got out and took a closer look."
"Frank, your wife's on the phone."
"Stan just radioed in from Pamela's apartment, only the name on the lease is JMJ Wilgis."
"JMJ, a brother, sister?"
For 30 years I work to build up trademark.
Just because we sign contract does not mean that I do not care what goes on.
"The only thing that concerns you, Norstaad, is that I have a further payment of $200,000 to meet in four months, and after that a continuing royalty of 5% on any furniture I sell under your trademark."
I will not let you cheat people under my name.
"That is my design on top, but not underneath."
This is not my chair.
This is not a piece of furniture.
This is toothpicks.
This is trash.
Parker!
Parker!
All right.
"If you want to play rough, I'll show you I can play a lot rougher."
Now go on.
Get out of here.
Get out of here before I bash in your thick skull!
All right.
I go.
But don't think that you bluff me for one minute.
Miss Morrow called about the certified check.
Never mind that.
Get me Reed on the phone right away.
- Who?
- Latham Reed!
And hurry it up.
Would you please tell Miss Morrow that Axel Norstaad is here?
"Sorry, but she isn't in."
Would you care to leave a message?
"No, I've got to talk to her."
I've got to see her right away.
"Well, she just this moment left."
When she will be back?
"I mean, you can go back to college if you want."
You can take classes.
"Writing, photography."
You can travel if you want.
"The point is, we have options."
Why can't you be happy?
I would be happier if we had coffee.
OK.
No.
"We swore for the sake of our sisterhood that we would never, ever ask each other to double date again."
"Oh, come on, Sarah."
We were 19 years old.
"That is ancient history and besides,"
I already told Robert that you would come.
"It's ""Robert"" now."
"I have seen the birthmark on his butt, so we're on a first name basis."
Would you just come on?
Lt'll be fun.
One thing Joe and I are not at the moment is fun.
I'd say we're downright gloomy.
"Well, shake it up."
Get out.
"Yeah, right."
Um...
"Intensive couples counseling didn't work, but a good dinner out, that'll fix everything."
I know you and Joe have been having a hard time.
"If I honestly believed staying home was going to help,"
- I'd drop it.
- There's a problem.
"OK, listen."
Fine.
"But if it's a complete disaster, don't say I didn't tell you."
"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, it's- It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, that's"
- That's bad.
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, look at"
- Look at this.
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
"I mean, just drink all your water you can get inside yourself."
"You know, just lots and lots of water."
"That way it'll fill up your stomach, and you won't get hungry."
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was.
Once.
- I got donuts.
They got jelly.
- (CHUCKLES)
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix at this high-end jewelry place.
"The manager was a drunk, and he would forget to lock the case with the expensive watches."
Neal...
I resisted.
Twice.
"Third time, this guy's just asking to get took."
"So, I grabbed a couple of cases of watches, and I hopped on a train to Portland."
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed them in a locker at the train station."
"They're still there, so that's hardly stealing."
"Well, so you got away clean?"
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras were stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
"I have never been one to believe that there's gonna be some knight in shining armor, and he pulls up into my driveway and sweeps me off my feet."
"But, you know, I really..."
I really never thought that it was gonna be this hard either.
"Oh, I..."
I have to go.
"So, thank you for not being a complete jerk about this."
Anytime.
Oh.
"And, uh... wish me luck."
"Then I said, ""You know, I know I'm supposed to be humble, but I'm better than that show."
"I mean, I can do more than play a Mafioso's son."
"At least give me a disease or a multiple personality or something."""
I can see how that'd be frustrating.
"And then finally I just said to him, ""Look, I'm not renewing my contract."""
"So, Kev, you got a boyfriend or something?"
"Uh, no."
"No, I don't."
"And, uh, h... how..."
how did you know I was gay?
I got a lot of gay friends.
"It's so much easier hanging out, you know?"
None of that alpha male weirdness.
- So you're not...?
- Gay?
- Yeah.
- No.
My girlfriend's got a theory we're all a little bit gay.
Right.
"Well, right."
"Well, I'm..."
"I'm pretty much fully gay, so..."
- So you have a girlfriend?
- Right.
"Okay, well, I'm gonna go."
This is long distance.
"Yeah, it is long distance."
"So, see you."
Yeah.
See you.
Mom?
What's wrong?
I'm experiencing frustration.
At the general state of things in the world or something in particular?
What do you wear to a graduation?
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress... so I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium.
"But if I don't have enough on and it's cold, I'll freeze."
"It is complicated, especially if you over think it."
I need a helpful comment.
Take light layers.
Wear your turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.
It's cool and it will look good without your gown on.
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress... and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium.
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited.
It's a big day.
What time will you get there?
"Are you fooling me, Brother Foon?"
"Master, if she bites me, what'll I do then?"
"If you switch her on by your tongue, she won't bit you, right?"
"Master, you are so nice to me."
"I am so nice to you, right?"
Yes.
Brother Yan.
Master.
Come here...
Ask her to stay in this room and don't leave.
"Later, water will come through this hole and aim at your face."
Stuff this pig's tongue into this hole.
Understand?
Yes.
Repeat once please.
Damn it!
"Later, a water-column will flush in through this hole."
"When you are damn wet, you stuff this damn pig's tongue into... this bloody hole."
You should have said in this way.
What a creep!
Let me have a second thought.
When Foon is kissing the pig's tongue which Yan's holding.
I'll be here to kiss Lotus.
"If she accused us,"
Foon will admit all the blames!
"Lotus will slap Foon severely, again and again and I'll go forward and kick him severely too."
"Lotus will lean on my chest, and I'll comfort her."
"I'll make her drunk, then I will..."
Who else can be the King of Brain-truster in this world except me?
No one else!
Why are you carrying luggage?
Moving?
Yes.
The joke.
"So, um..."
So there's this man.
"He rushes to the hospital, gets there, the doctor comes out, and he says, I'm so sorry."
"Wait, why is he rushing to the hospital?"
"Oh, his wife was in an accident."
Wait.
I thought I just said that.
So where was I?
Um...
"Oh right, she was in an accident, and the doctor says, uh..."
What kind of accident?
"Again, so, worst shape possible."
"She basically lost all of her limbs, so, the doctor says, you know, and she may not be able to recognize you ever, ever again, and the husband says, oh my gosh, this is terrible news."
"And the doctor says, by the way, she's dead."
"She's, she's dead."
"So a man hears that his wife's in a horrible accident, he rushes to the hospital."
"When he gets there, the doctor says, I'm so sorry, but the accident has left your wife blind, deaf, and mute, and she'll never be able to recognize you again."
"The guy's like, oh my God this is terrible news, and that's when the doctor says,"
I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
It's funnier.
30 seconds.
"Man, it's really our last one."
Ssh.
"Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up."
Shit.
"We gotta go, we can't go this way."
Okay.
You ready?
- Yeah.
You're always taking them away so you can wear them yourself.
Merle!
"All I want for my birthday is Danny, and I'm going with him."
Now you stop this.
I hate you.
I hate you!
"If you try to stop me, Aunt Olivia, I'll kill you."
"You know, she just might do it."
"Hey, not bad."
What name did you register under?
Lenore Adams.
I hope that meets with your approval.
"Hey, now come on, come on."
This is the big night.
This is what we've been waiting for.
"21 candles, remember?"
I still think it's a dirty trick.
"That poor little nitwit has fallen in love with you, hasn't she?"
Next I suppose you'll say you want to marry her.
"If I married every girl that had eyes for me,"
I'd have them strung out from here to...
Anywhereland.
"Oh, yeah, you're quite a rocket."
"All right, how much do you think you're gonna get for the diamonds?"
"$50,000, easy."
Merle's worth a quarter of a million-- or she will be as soon as Uncle Howard decides she's old enough to handle it.
That's the way her trust is set up.
Did you know that?
"No, I didn't know that."
"And, uh...how do you know that?"
"I keep my ears open, too."
[whistles] A quarter of a million dollars.
Krishna.
"Hey smarty, what if it has your name on it?"
If you write your name of this colony..
..then will this colony belong to you?
"Look mister, you dont.."
- Move on!
"Yobbo, quickly get out of here.."
..or I shall break your bones.
Hey but that trunk belongs to me.
"Look mister, this trunk is mine.."
..please give it back to me.
It contains a very precious thing which belongs to me.
I beg of you.
- Look I have gone crazy..
"But mister, listen to me.."
"Mister, give me my trunk back."
"Look, give me my trunk back."
"Hey ruffian, get the trunk."
"Come on let me see, pick up the trunk."
"I swear on God, dont worry, brother."
You have landed in the right hands.
"Hey boss, what are you doing!"
Do you wish to kill this person by hitting him so hard?
"And brother, even you should leave this place."
This fellow is a very crazy man.
But he took my trunk..
- Let the trunk go to hell.
And you get lost from here.
"Brother, this blood is more expensive than yourtrunk."
Go.
"Look mister, I have requested you a Iot."
I have even begged to you.
It all boils down to the old question.
Is there a life after marriage?
She just didn't wanna hurt my pride.
Wants me to think that I'm the breadwinner.
Pretty soon the romance goes.
"And, as the song says women get weary wearing the same shabby dress."
"Well, then, that's the time to go out and buy her another shabby dress."
That's why she's doing it this way.
Instead of just wapping up a million dollars.
"I guess I have been selfish forcing her to give up her witchhood, live on my salary."
- Poor little witch.
"- You see, the thing to do is to try to keep the magic in your marriage."
I guess I'll just have to go along with her.
She's been a great wife.
Be my way of saying thanks.
"Oh, listen, you're welcome."
"Anytime, Darrin, old boy."
Anytime.
"Oh, Darrin!"
"Oh, it's..."
It's beautiful.
"Well, you shouldn't have."
"Oh, but I'm glad you did."
"Well, I can afford it."
Because you got the Waterhouse account?
"You guessed I would, huh?"
"Well, you deserve it."
It's beautiful.
"You like my gift, huh?"
"Well, Darrin, you know what they say."
"It isn't the gift, it's the thought that counts."
"Oh, yes, of course I like it."
Do you know why I gave them?
So that he could photocopy them.
"And, do you know why I gave them to Kaan?"
Because I trust him.
If you ever ask me how I know that... because the animal didn't even look at questions once.
Come in!
Give them to me.
Go to your seat.
Did you ever check the questions?
Don't talk nonsense!
Of course I didn't.
Are you crazy?
And he says he didn't check them with no shame at all.
"Don't tell me, ""Don't you feel ashamed?"""
- What happened to you?
"- I am answering, (e) gone crazy"
You drove me crazy.
"It's enough, enough."
Did you get that?
It's enough!
Don't shout.
She's studying.
Did your daughter's success just occur to you now?
I'll get her married to a man and it will be over.
Do you understand that?
"You'll get her married, huh?"
Whose daughter are you forcing to marry?
My daughter will finish her studies.
Then she'll marry the man she loves.
"So, she'll marry the man she loves and live a miserable life like I do?"
I am going to divorce you!
Divorce me!
"Well, we had a nice, long talk"
"- this afternoon, didn't we?"
- Yeah.
"Oh, my God, this is an intervention!"
"Yeah, you could kind of call it that."
"Listen, Gray, you're meant for more than sitting around answering trivia questions about history."
"Me, you, Firestorm."
We're made for changing history.
- This is my life.
- And your life will be waiting for you when you get back.
You really want me to do this?
"I could never forgive myself if I kept you from it, my husband the superhero."
Why are you looking at me like that?
Wasn't sure you'd make it.
"You left me a message, I came."
What of it?
I just wanted to talk.
"You and I, we've done a lot of thieving, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun."
"Anyway, I, uh..."
I just wanted to make sure
I said something important that wasn't left unsaid.
"Mick, I don't do touchy-feely."
"If you got something to say, say it."
This wasn't a good idea.
You're the best guy I ever knew.
"You may not think you're a hero, but you're a hero to me."
You got that?
"Yeah, I got it."
See you around.
You okay?
Fine.
- So did you tell him?
I will threaten to go to the cops.
"She'll lose her license, her business, maybe does some time."
Or she signs the farm over to me.
"If Audrey signs the farm over to you, the other grandchildren will all have grounds for suit once the value of the land is discovered."
We'll fight them.
And you'd be tied up in legal battles for years.
"Legally, the better play would be to sign the quick claim over to the only surviving child."
- What?
- Your mother.
Maybe we can make a deal with her.
"Although shit, no."
[sigh] Julia told me she's somewhere on the West Coast.
No.
She's not.
She's here in Bridgeport.
She came back a few years ago.
She's just never contacted anybody.
I think she's just waiting for Otto and Audrey to... to die.
"Well, call her up."
I...
She doesn't have a phone.
I...
"If it's a long story, then let's go see her."
I don't know where she is.
"I have to look for her, okay?"
Okay.
Call me when you've found her.
Cheers for the drink.
That went well.
We didn't have time to prep for a rollover.
What did you always tell me?
Work the problem.
"You see you don't understand, you're not a hobbyist."
Where is Nick?
I need to talk to him.
I myself wouldn't mind knowing where he's hiding.
But is he home?
Because I've got news.
"I know he is your husband, but my god!"
"What's your news, love?"
"I wanted to tell Nick first, but uhm..."
I'm pregnant.
"Jenny, love, that's fantastic!"
"Oh, my sweet, that's wonderful."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, the doctor found out while he was checking my urine for... for no reason."
I'm going to be a great-grandmother!
No!
"No, Mum, you're going to be a grandmother, you're still going to be a grandmother."
"Oh, even better."
Was it a surprise?
"Well, I have been feeling quite queasy in the mornings but..."
I put that down to other factors.
"Oh, that boy."
"I'll give him credit, hat's off, you know?"
He gets the job done.
Although you know with the extra mouth to feed and everything...
"Oh, its little mouth."
"We might not be able to move out straight away, we might need to stay a little bit longer if that's okay."
That's lovely.
"It's better than okay, poppet."
"It's better than okay, better than okay."
"I need to tell Nick, I can't wait any longer."
"Hi, hi Nick, it's me."
"If you get picked up now, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the Hole."
"Yeah, I thought of that."
I don't blame you guys for laying down on me.
"But do something for me, will ya?"
Sure.
"Yeah, what?"
Get out of here.
I don't like the way ya smell.
"Go on, all of ya."
"Come on, beat it."
"I guess I'm a sucker, but I just can't get it out of my nut."
Ross doing all those months in the Hole just to cover up for me.
"But still, he didn't have to, did he?"
"No, he didn't have to."
Remember what Ross' dame said that day about...?
"About Ross and me wanting the same thing all our lives, and he was doing something about it--?"
"Yep, I remember."
What about it?
"I think she had something there, so--"
So what?
So maybe I better do something about it.
Don't be a fool.
If you're picked up--
Shut up!
Where did you ever get the idea I was a fool?
"I broke out of that pen once, didn't I?"
And I can do it again.
"Now, listen, Stacey, you can't-- You heard me, shut up."
"You do the listening, I'll do the talking."
And pay attention.
"Because if there's any slip-up on your part of this, you'll answer to the boys for it."
"Now, here's the gag."
We should celebrate.
"I have no champagne, so here... this will have to do."
Here you go.
"Drink away, man!"
When is the big day?
All right.
"You know that I like... there's this bowling tournament in Las Vegas, I wanted to go to, so I figure..."
I'll just take care of everything at once.
"Like, I got a thousand dollars saved up already, all I need is like... 4,000 more dollars."
"Please, don't ask me for money, bro'."
"- Not from you, from the store."
"- I can't do it, man."
You told me the other day how much you're taking in a week.
- You don't understand.
- I'll pay you back.
- It's not that.
"- Then, what?"
- There's some shit you don't know.
- What?
What I don't know?
"Right now, for all intents and purposes, your father owns la bodega."
- Get the fuck out of here!
"- Mickey, I ain't fucking around."
Why do you think I took over the store?
- You think I want to run this?
"- No, but your papá..."
"Yo, listen man."
"Your father told me I had no choice,"
Eddie's into him for 25 fucking grand.
"How is he gonna give your father 25 grand, and he's not gonna give me nothing?"
What the fuck!
"Look, chill, man."
"Minor shaker, Dr. Stegman."
We have them from time to time.
It will stop shortly.
"You can let go now, Elmer."
It's over.
I would have said he was totally gorked.
"Oh, he was."
What happened here?
In medical terms?
A miracle.
But there's a price to be paid for the miraculous.
And Blue Cross doesn't cover it.
This is Kingdom Hospital... where the ground is uneasy... and old secrets have begun to rise to the surface.
"Please, come again."
Thank God you stopped.
"Okay, um, I'm not even gonna get into what's wrong with the actual choreography."
"I'm gonna start with your shoes, okay?"
I told you to get Capezio jazz oxfords.
I will get those shoes today.
"You'll get the shoes, but you'll also get the steps."
"So we'll break it down one more time, and just watch only my feet."
I've been doing this since I was seven.
My sounds are a little off 'cause I don't really practice that much.
"Uh, you know what?"
"I can do that, but not the way you're doing it."
I can go...
Why can't I just do that?
Because that's not the choreography!
- There you go.
"- Okay, I'm gonna think about this."
You move your feet.
"I'll be honest with you, I did not like him."
Is something wrong with chubby and nerdy?
- I like chubby and nerdy.
- No.
That has nothing to do with it.
I was on scholars' bowl in 8th grade.
[ Laughter ] Wood:
Things were looking up.
"If these girls liked nerdy, I was in business."
This is where I'm a little bit of a Honda nerd.
"You notice, you guys, the floor back there is flat?"
It is flat.
"That was a big design point, 'cause normally, cars have the little hump."
"Yeah, there's no hump so when you're riding bitch, you're not really riding bitch."
"Oh, my gosh."
I actually never noticed that.
"So, Clark, this is your truck?"
"Yeah, this is my truck."
How did you arrive at buying a truck like this?
"I mean, I like it."
It's a Hemi.
What's a Hemi?
Hemi is the top of the...
It's a hemispherical.
The top of the valve is...
It's not flat.
"Wait, show me that again?"
The top of the...
[ Laughter ]
Let me just point out why chunky guys are great for hot girls...
"We'll always appreciate you, not like skinny dudes."
It's true.
I sure wish your mother was here.
She's coming.
Yeah.
She'll be here.
Tell your mother I love her.
I was... hard on you.
I pushed you... away.
I'm glad you... came... home.
I'm proud of you.
He's gone.
Okay...
The big toast.
"Before I start, is there anyone who hasn't written me a speech?"
"I mean, it really makes me wonder how screwed up you think I am that I can't be trusted to say a few things about my brother."
"The thing is, uh,"
"Oh, yeah, the thing is these are all pretty lame."
Not one of them mentions my brother's musical theater phase when we all thought he was gay.
Seriously.
"I mean you have not heard disturbing until you've heard him singing ""One Hand, One Heart"" in the shower every morning."
"I tease my brother a lot, but the truth is the truth is I'm very proud of him."
"I'm, uh..."
I'm proud of how kind he is...
"I'm, uh, I'm proud of how giving he is, and, uh... he's a very lucky man."
Really.
My father's dead.
We'll get through.
Get Gray back to town.
What?
W-Wait a minute...
"Come tomorrow, what's left of us will need a leader."
I think we've lost enough in that department for one day.
We're gonna need every set of hands we can get.
How did he manage to hide a twin brother from us?
"Sir, Mikhail never communicated with him."
"If he had, we'd have known."
All right.
"Well, in less than 56 hours that bank in Nice opens the safe deposit box... and we all read about ourselves in the ""New York Times""."
If that happens... we'll be spending the rest of our lives wondering how we screwed up so badly.
Washington doesn't like federal agents... working for the Russian mob.
Our names are on that list.
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.
We don't have any options.
We'll get him.
"And, guys, keep this one alive."
I doubt if they were triplets.
Triplets.
"Alex, what are you doing?"
Look at this mess.
"Maybe if you told me what you're looking for, I could help you find it."
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.
What'd you find?
He knew about me.
What'd you do in the war?
Sniper.
Why wait five years to find me?
Jimmy!
You in there?
"Open up, you shithead!"
This stuff's hot!
This is not your lucky day.
Tell your boss to leave me the fuck alone!
"Lvan, you look like your parrot died."
"Come on, Trevor, wake up."
Preston set that up.
"Crime waves hit, property value drops."
Then Preston moves in and buys it all up for cheap.
Shut up!
"Trevor, listen to me."
He doesn't give a damn about black or white.
The only color that son of a bitch cares about is green.
"Come on, kid, you gotta believe me."
Drop the gun.
"You let her go, we can work it out."
He told me you would try to turn me.
There are no traitors!
Voicemail messages?
That's ludicrous.
That boy is mentally unstable.
He always has been.
"Clark Preston, you have the right to remain silent."
I'm innocent.
And please feel free to exercise that right.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
"If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you."
"""I'm for truth, no matter who tells it."
"I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against."""
Malcolm X.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
Emily...
I'm so sorry.
"""Out there in the field, sorry doesn't bring people back."""
Ohh.
That was.
-.
That was...
There's nothing to move.
I...
I was...
I had a sunburn.
"Good night, sir."
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!
See and take in with your eyes all the beauty the ocean has to offer!
"As these new things come at you, you may not have seen them before, but be open to them and find the beauty within."
"Hey, buddy."
Yep.
Thanks a lot for bringing me to Problem Island.
What are we gonna do for an encore?
Talk about all the people that we slept with before we were married and really stir shit up?
What the hell are you talking about?
The therapist is trying to create a problem in my marriage that doesn't exist!
"Maybe he's not creating them, maybe he's just noticing them."
"Okay, you know what?"
Don't start with me.
I'm serious.
I don't need it.
"These are the best in the world at what they do, all right?"
"If Jeff Gordon told you that your oil was low, you might want to think about changing it."
"From the bucket, feed them!"
My therapist is kind of pushy.
Really?
Yeah.
"God, I like ours."
"Yeah, he said that Dave and I take each other for granted."
"That, you know, our relationship has become more like a job."
I don't know what you're doing.
"Whatever it is, I don't want to talk about it."
"For a little magazine, we have very good sources."
You want to know why?
I am relentless and driven.
I make it easier for them to tell than to resist me.
I know about the grand jury.
I know about Rick's indictment.
lndictment?
He hasn't even appeared.
- That's just what I hear.
- From who?
And you're going to print this?
I thought I should let you know.
"You're going to print an article that says Rick is going to be indicted when you haven't interviewed him, and you are not naming any sources?"
I can't.
The testimony's sealed.
You are not going to print this.
Because it's a lie.
- You know it's a lie?
- lt's a lie.
- How?
- How do you think?
He told me.
"He has done nothing wrong, and I will not be party to anything that might hurt him, not to mention protecting you in a libel suit."
Whoa.
Lily.
Ferocious in defense of her man.
I'm serious.
- And what if you're wrong about him?
- l'm not.
I'm just not.
"Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast."
"I gotta get back, gotta find my wife, you know?"
What do you got?
You see her?
That's my wife.
Jennifer?
Shane?
"God, Shane, there you are!"
I've been looking all over for you.
"Jennifer, what are you doing here?"
"Look, I heard at the salon that you were coming to this crazy singles' island, so I just felt a strong sense of urgency that you and I needed to talk before it was too late."
"Jennifer, you left me, remember?"
"I know, I know."
But then I was hoping that you would come after me.
It wasn't like you walked out of a bar!
It was a divorce.
And why are you even at this place?
Do you know this place is insane?
I'm getting called names.
"I've been called a cougar, a black panther, a puma!"
I had to smack this one kid.
That's the last time he'll walk up to a woman talking about cougar!
Yeah.
I've been looking all over the place for you.
And where have you been?
"Well, actually, I'm staying on the other side, the couples' side, with my girlfriend."
What?
Who?
Her name is Trudy and she's aspiring to be a manager.
Put it in my mouth!
"Go, go, go!"
Trudy?
That's what I meant.
it's crazy but I like it.
Bull.
I know you're a little upset about this poem thing. but--
"He said I could make $10,000 a night."
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand American dollars?
"Well, Bull, you're not serious about this?"
"You know, you people always assume you know what's best for me."
"Well, I'll tell you something, you don't."
Maybe it's time to shake up my life.
"Bull, you don't just become a wrestler overnight."
It takes a lot of time and training.
"If you decide to take up wrestling, you're gonna have to quit your job here."
"Now, I want you to take some time and really think about this."
okay-
I quit.
Oh.
He's not serious.
"Well, I mean, he'll cool down and then he'll change his mind."
I hope he's wearing boxer shorts.
[WOMAN SCREAMSI
Briefs.
This is ridiculous.
Bail reports don't just vanish into thin air.
Bull has been gone a week and this place has already turned upside down.
"Yeah, and it doesn't just stop with the paperwork."
It's open season on us in the courtroom.
"Well, word's out on the street Bull's gone."
Somebody's gotta keep order around here.
"Well, that's Dirk's job."
Hi. everybody.
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, well, it's-- it's a mess."
Would you like to grab some coffee?
That's a spectacularly bad idea.
You're right.
I grabbed the wrong file.
"I meant to grab the file of ""reasonably bad ideas,"""
"but I grabbed the ""spectacularly bad ones"" instead."
Been that kind of day.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Just one.
"This is dumb, hanging out here waiting for him."
"Well, do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a $2 movie theater?"
Or he could be hiking in Griffith Park for all we know.
"I know, I know."
We should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em.
Don't be snippy with me.
I'm not on your damn TV show.
"God, I hate this day."
"Well, I'm not exactly over the moon about it, either."
I know what Jonathan would do.
"He would call some friend in Washington, and there'd be some really fancy, expensive detective here with Justin in about four hours."
"Well, why don't you call him?"
"You know, you really can tell me the problem with him."
I swear I won't judge.
The problem... doesn't feel like you and Dad.
I guess they don't make 'em like that anymore.
Oh.
Look.
"Oh, yeah..."
- We've just had too many damn blessings.
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic and low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape to the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say, but I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
No.
"I've just come from work, actually!"
I just thought I'd...
I'm trying to make my hair and coat sort of join.
So we don't know where one ends and one begins?
Like a sort of Camden owl.
LAUGHTER
"Now then, where does your style come from?"
Em...
"And this sounds rude, but were you always like this?"
I guess so.
My mum's quite stylish.
Yeah.
My dad used to be.
"In the '70s, he'd wear mental clothes."
"Like yellow flares and tops with stars on them, then he went quite straight in the '80s."
You had young parents.
Your mum was 18?
"Yeah, really young."
So they were really cool and dressed like they were in Black Sabbath.
Then all of a sudden in the '80s my dad got quite square.
"""That's enough of yellow flares."
"I'll just wear a shirt and some leisure trousers."""
"He just stopped, but my mum carried on."
Where was this?
In South London.
What was hilarious was they had this three-wheeler car called a Bomb Bug.
An orange thing and the roof went up like that.
So not only did they wear yellow flares and had a three-wheeled orange triangle car...
I was just a laughing stock!
"It sounds like you grew up in a cartoon, didn't you?"
"It was a bit like Roobarb and Custard, yeah."
Your wife told me to ask if you could help me.
She's in bad trouble.
Her neighbors complained to the landlord about her dog.
He told her to get rid of the animal.
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.
"When the landlord found out, he got mad and told her to leave."
Now she can't stay even if she gets rid of it.
I'm so ashamed!
He said he'd get the police to throw us out on the street.
"I'm sorry, but..."
I could give you a couple dollars to help you move.
I can't move!
I want you to talk to him!
Tell him I want to stay here!
What's your landlord's name?
His name is Signor Roberto.
"He lives on Fourth Street, near here."
"They break the windows, they dirty the floors..."
"A real pig-sty, eh?"
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.
She says she's been evicted for no good reason.
"She's a poor widow, she has nobody to take care of her."
"She has no relatives, no money."
All she has is this neighborhood.
I already rented the place to another family.
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.
She got rid of the animal that caused all the trouble.
So let her stay.
Impossible.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
"- l'm telling you, I hope he does."
"- No, don't be stupid."
You know it's weird.
I always think of you as Rayanne's friend.
"I mean like, you just think of me as..."
"as someone who's just, you know, around."
It's weird how something has to happen sometimes... to see how you actually feel about something.
"Sit down, Mr. Krakow, we're just waiting for our friends..."
from law enforcement.
It won't happen again.
You're damn right it won't!
Next time something like that happens the little girl is coming out of the window with a bullet in her head.
ERIC:
Mary.
"Oh, what the hell, Ray?"
Leave the little girl alone.
You stay right there.
You sad little man.
Who do you think you are?
God?
You shut up.
"He's not God, Dorothy."
He's just a poor excuse for a man.
A man without any faith.
Faith?
You're gonna talk to me about faith?
"God comes down and, pluck, there goes your son, no more Luke."
Bye-bye.
Why?
"Dale, why?"
Because He's up in His Heaven and all's right with the world?
Or because we live in a stinking sewer where nothing makes one bit of sense?
RAY:
But you have faith.
"Your son dies for no reason, but you have faith."
"You get taken and tortured, but you have faith."
( Ray laughs )
"If I didn't, then I wouldn't have any reason to go on living."
"Then you crawl away and you die, because this right here-- this is as much sense as the world will ever make."
What are you doing?
I told you I didn't want anyone killed.
I told them I was on sabbatical.
"Uh, where was I?"
When did I get back?
What the hell is a sabbatical?
"Relax, they're not coming to see you."
"They're going straight to school, say hi to Ritchie and be out of there before their beers get warm."
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now, so leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hey, it's me, just thought I'd true you again."
"Get that, I'll wait."
I'm at the door.
She's coming.
"I didn't want to just stop by, but it was either this or drop leaflets on your lawn from a plane, so, here I am."
I was going to return your calls but I've been super-duper busy.
"Yeah, since Witch Detective took off, we hardly see her anymore."
Get out.
Come on in.
"What-what, um, what are you doing here?"
"Well, I can't stop thinking about our date."
I thought it... it was great.
"But then, when you didn't call me back, I thought maybe it wasn't great."
"And then I started thinking about the other things I thought were great, and maybe they weren't great either."
I-Is baseball great?
Is democracy great?
I-I don't know anymore.
"No, it was;"
it was a great date.
So let's go on another one.
"Oh, I don't know."
I'm gonna marry her one day.
cool.
"Man, this place is huge."
"-Imposing, is what it is."
-It's big.
Just looking at the size of the place just gives that extra edge to the nerve in a way because there's like double the people to impress.
How's it going?
"Hey, man."
"Wow, this is big."
Let's have a look.
This is mad.
Bad idea.
Nice day.
"Oh, my God."
This place is huge.
This is mad.
Sick.
his is absolutely mad.
can't wait to get out here and play.
I just wanna get on with it.
hello.
t was the most exciting thing in the world.
"I really wish my parents were here, actually, to see it because they don't get to see a Iot of us and to see us doing something like this and see what it's all about...."
"But it's good we're getting it in the film, so they'II get to see anyway."
So everyone's a winner.
You know if we'd got ask ed  two years ago what we thought would happen we never would've said this.
hen think about how lucky we actually are to be in this position....
"It's, Iike, probably one in a million chance to be where I am."
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"f one of us just didn't happen to go to our audition then you know, it could be so different."
e are definitely the five Iuckiest dudes.
Her and my grandpa own a bunch of them.
"This is supposed to be the model home, but it never got finished."
Why?
"Did someone die here, and now it's haunted?"
"Yes, that's exactly what happened."
What did happen?
I don't know.
How do contractors just disappear?
"If we don't have a model home, we don't have a new development."
It's been a month.
I'm not waiting for you guys anymore.
You know where to reach me.
No luck with the contractors?
Vanished.
My father's never gonna let me hear the end of this.
Did you talk to Seth?
I think so.
But don't blame yourself.
I'm not blaming myself.
But how can I allow a strange boy to live in this house?
Seth needs to know it's what any mother would do.
I was talking about the contractors.
So you want him to stay here?
"Well, I mean, I know the place needs some sprucing up, but..."
"God, did I just say ""sprucing""?"
"So, Ryan, what do you think?"
I haven't really had time to think.
But how much better is this place than some group home?
And wait till you see the best part.
It's an empty pool.
To some people.
"So, your mom."
"We're still pulling what's left of him from the truck wreckage,"
But we were able to lift some prints
From the passports that I found.
We had a vodka bottle.
"Plus, we got this beauty."
Don't touch.
What did the lab rats say?
They think it's some kind of long-range transmitter.
How long?
Moscow-long?
Run his picture by your embassy friend.
I'm on it.
"Hey, passport guy's mine."
You got any friends in moscow?
Or anywhere else?
Don't be that guy.
Ran the license plate we pulled from the roxxon debris.
Belongs to howard stark.
I found that.
Where's the rest of the car?
"Uh, we just got a plate and a bumper."
"Boss, stark was on the lam when roxxon went down."
Do we really think he would risk his freedom to blow it up?
Or in...
whatever the hell happened.
Somebody was driving that car.
I want to know who.
"Edwin, leave the dishes."
I can take care of it.
"Anna, darling, I'm going to take you up on that offer."
The day beckons.
"I'll, uh, be in the garden."
Good!
Your minds has also sharpened up along with your body.
"So partner, why did you want to see me?"
I need a house.
Are you looking to buy one?
"No, want to rent one."
So what is the problem?
- Nobody wants to give it to a bachelor.
And I can't call my sister here until I have a house.
Don't worry!
Call your sisters!
How can I call them till I have a house!
Don't worry about that!
I have a lady friend too!
What family were you talking about?
He is a bachelor!
Why?
I am there!
These days even two men can start a family!
"Stay within your limits, Johnny!"
Just kidding!
He has got two lovely sisters.
They will come and stay with him.
You can lord over them!
They will help you in your housework too!
How much is the rent?
"3,000 rupees, no security because Johnny has brought you here."
But I will take three months advance.
My tenants will vacate the room in 15 days.
But you need to pay the advance now.
His sisters will be here in 15 days.
He will give you the advance then and you hand us the keys at the same time.
Not anymore.
What do you mean?
"- Well, neither of us has a husband now."
- Wh-What did you say?
"Well, Danny, about ten minutes before I left to come down here, my husband called, and he wants a divorce."
"Aw, come..."
Come on.
You don't have to worry about that.
"I mean, that's just talk."
It's not gonna happen.
[Louise] You're right.
"It's not going to happen, without one hell of a fight."
"Why isn't it gonna happen, Danny?"
"- Hey, come on."
We're talking.
"- Eh, what am I supposed to do, dig a hole?"
[Laughs] He got you there.
"They said that I should talk, you know, to give an expression to myself."
"Okay, maybe I'm a little bit pushy."
But I can't keep talking if he's gonna keep shutting' me up!
"Doctor, l-I don't even want this guy in here."
"I mean, after all, we had the perfect family without him."
"""We had a family."" Tell me about it."
No.
The family and the group are the same.
"Now, when I lost my son three months ago, these people were wonderful."
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that, Mr. Seymour."
"We've already been through that, Mr. Theodopilus."
Don't take us backwards.
"Besides, it's... it's all right about your family now, isn't it?"
"No, it's not all right!"
It'll never be all right.
Right.
"Maybe I didn't have a fluorescent suntan, but I'd spent my share of time in pool halls as a kid."
"Of course, that was a long time ago."
- Straight pool?
- Mm-hmm.
"Gee, I haven't played since I learned for Roger."
"In Bayonne, girls in their late 20s, or early 30s, still do that for their men."
Roger and I met playing pool.
I felt this... attraction to him and asked him to teach me.
"When someone's showing you the game, there's a lot of... touching and being close."
"Well, by the end of the evening, he'd asked me out."
It was just like in the movies.
You know what I mean?
I think I can guess.
Excuse me.
"Well, just when I know he's about ready to pop the question, he disappears."
- Ah.
"- Almost a year later, I get this postcard from him... with this P.O. box postmark, you know?"
"Once the writing started again, we burned up the post office."
"I mean torrid, you know?"
"And then, bam!"
A marriage proposal.
Excuse me.
"Well, I was so excited I couldn't sleep for two nights."
And then I telegraphed.
"""Yes. '."""
"And then yesterday, when I got off the plane..."
No Roger.
That's 24 hours you owe me.
Rack 'em up.
Well?
"Well, we do what we have to do."
We know that you were his dealer.
Okay.
I think we're done here.
I don't know anything about drugs.
"And just so we're super clear on that,"
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.
Thanks.
"Okay, you do that."
"You call your lawyer, and he'll get you out in no time."
But that's when I get started.
What is that supposed to mean?
I'll be all over you.
"Whatever you do, buy, sell, I'll be watching you."
That's actually called harassment.
It is.
It's called harassment.
"You really want to do that to your business, Jake?"
"Look, we're just after whoever actually killed Aldo Clemens."
My hunch is killing isn't exactly your thing.
"Answer some questions, I'll be out of your life."
I might have known this guy.
"If I did,"
I would have dropped him as a client months ago.
He run out of money?
No.
They always find the money.
Aldo... had become a risk.
"Some guy was following him, so I cut him off."
Who was following Aldo?
You got a name?
I can't even tell you what he looked like.
He was some guy in a crappy car.
We're not going to sleep.
We're not?
Mmm-mmm.
What we gonna do in there?
For real?
So how was your night?
My husband found himself in a very traumatic shark situation.
Here we go.
"As we were planning to go to the waterfall and have a romantic evening, because, as you know, we don't do that very often because of the kids and work..."
"But somehow, this crazy, traumatic shark experience was enough to make him neglect his wife."
"Ronnie, nice to meet you."
Well said.
"David, how did that make you feel?"
I know my truth.
Excuse me?
I know my truth.
"Did you say, ""l know my truth',?"
"Oh, boy."
"Listen, I'm telling you, you getting on my last nerve!"
"Yo, I didn't sign up for this!"
"Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing."
You said we was gonna be partying.
You said we was gonna be doing what we do.
"You made promises, Daddy."
"Boo-Boo, look, they got me doing a lot of activities."
What do you expect from me?
I'm tired.
You tired?
"Yo, I'm tired."
"Plain and simple, I ain't having it."
"Sometimes we forget how to do the easiest thing in the world, which is just to talk to each other."
"Okay, let's start here."
No exit.
It's like the bullet went in... and vanished.
"Look at this, Al."
Someone dragged her onto that dock.
"Oh, come on."
Lots of women have scuffed-up heels on their shoes.
"No, not Hilla."
Her friend told me that Hilla always kept her clothes perfect.
"Whoever killed her, dragged her to the end of the dock."
"I hate to tell you this, Sherlock, but she could have shot herself."
Where's the gun?
Maybe it fell into the lake.
"No, I don't think so."
Why not?
"If Hilla committed suicide, I wouldn't be here."
The only thing that makes sense is that I'm here to find out who murdered her.
"[ Sam Narrating ] Whenever I quantum leap, I get to see what it's like to walk in another man's shoes."
And sometimes what it's like to drive in his car.
"I knew very little about Hilla, except that she survived a war when everyone else in her family died."
She was either lucky or had a strong will to live.
One of these had run out on her.
I had to find out which one.
Greg.
Ah.
Melvin.
How you doin'?
Fine.
Fine.
"Uh, we're just wrapping up for winter here."
Uh-
"- Um, could you tell me which room was Hilla's?"
The key doesn't have a number on it.
- These were all his decisions?
- Yeah.
We just gave him the stage and he ran with it.
- I hope we got his business number.
- So good.
"Project Jenny, Project Jan is this band here."
- This guy was so good.
"- By the way Jeremy who plays Randy, when we made out in the first club scene and we made out for a while, and he was getting married the next day."
It was like a really funny thing.
It felt like I was his bachelor party.
I didn't find that out until the end of the day.
I felt guilty that I asked him to do that when he's getting married the next morning.
It's a hell of a bachelor party.
- It's all acting.
- Yeah.
- He was in character.
- He's a cool guy.
- Look at his guy.
Look at his guy.
"- This guy, I mean..."
"- Look, he's shameless."
- Somebody get this guy a show.
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
"And then all of a sudden, ""Hey, I'll blow their minds real quick."""
The shot looks like it was orchestrated to highlight the backflip.
- But it wasn't.
It was just in there.
- It was the master of the scene there.
This was the coldest I've ever been in my life.
Ever.
Ever.
Ever.
Goodnight.
So you can move your cloud?
You can control it.
"No, no-one can control clouds, that would be silly."
"The wind, a little bit."
She's following us!
That's the idea.
Keep her away from the snow.
So.
"Barmaid or governess, which is it?"
"That thing is after us, and you want a chat?"
"Well, we can't chat after we've been horribly killed, can we?"
How did we get up so high so quick?
"Clever staircase, it's taller on the inside!"
"What am I standing on, what's this made of?"
Super-dense water vapour.
"Should keep her trapped, for the moment."
So you actually live up here?
"On a cloud, in a box?"
"I have done, for a long time."
"Blimey, you really know how to sulk."
I'm not sulking!
You live in a box!
That's no more a box than you are a governess.
"Oh, spoken like a man!"
You're the same as all the rest.
"Sweet little Clara, works at the Rose And Crown, ideas above her station!"
"For your information,"
"I'm not sweet on the inside, and I'm certainly not... little."
It's called the TARDIS.
It can travel anywhere in time and space.
And it's mine.
"I made commitments,"
"I told her you would behave like an adult, and you do exactly the opposite."
"Wait, you're starting to piss me off."
- I'm telling you it's not my fault.
"- Right, you're a victim."
"If you want to be helped, you need to change your tune!"
What is this fucking lecture?
"You pretend to be nice, but you're an arsehole like the rest of them!"
Take back what you just said.
It's not my fault trouble follows me around!
My life sucks and it won't change.
Only my mother understood me.
Even when she was wasted she understood me.
"You know, Dylan is one of these helpless teenagers."
"He's nice, and the next minute he messes up."
"It's true, I misjudged him."
I heard he came to talk to me.
The other two went after him when he meant no harm.
See if the judge can move him to another home.
No one can stand him here.
That's the paradox for these kids.
They need attention and all they get is hate.
I'll call the judge.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
Mr Zeppini.
"I was freed an hour ago, so I came to thank you."
May I?
- Please.
A client who thanks me is a rare thing.
That how I am.
When I'm happy I let people know.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy, with a hook, and he lived in a mirror."
"And if you even looked at him, you'd wake up in a bathtub full of ice, with your kidneys gone."
Whoa.
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- What?
"- You name the terms, I name the place."
"OK, fine!"
Where we gonna do this?
Castle Duloc?
"Ha, ha, very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived.
Ja!
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost.
"If you're all too scared to put on big boy pants and go in,"
I'll just claim my winnings and be on my way.
"Now, wait a minute!"
We can last in there just as long as you can.
Fine.
Come on then.
"Hold up, Shrek."
"You can't just go barging into some creepy, spookyjoint like you own the place."
And why not?
It's not like there's anyone here to stop us.
"I still don't know about this, man."
I'm getting a whole creepy House of wax vibe going on in here.
"Look, it's that little thingy you love so much, remember?"
Welcome to Duloc
It's a creepy town
What was once pristine Now is all rundown
Full ammo loads.
- They're coming from the north.
- We're gonna setup a rescue party ?
No.
We don't have the manpower.
We have to defend the position.
"- Lee, she could be dying out there."
"- Yeah, I know that, Sam."
"But we are thin on the ground here, and the cylons are on the march."
We can't help her.
We have to hold our positions.
Are you out of your frakkin' mind ?
"We just picked up 6 heavy Raiders falling away from the cylon fleet, definitely heading toward the planet."
I don't get it.
- They'd have to know we see them.
- They're testing us.
Want to know if we're bluffing about nuking the planet.
"Unfortunately, we are bluffing."
Are we ?
- Mr. Hoshi.
"- Aye, sir."
Order nuclear ground-strike missiles in the launch tubes four through ten.
"Aye, sir."
This is a nuclear mission order.
The major's right.
We don't have any troops to spare if we're gonna hold this position.
Screw this position !
We can take those hills.
Use guerilla tactics.
That's I've been talking about.
"No, that is not the mission."
We have our orders.
It's not too easy for me either.
"You're probably wondering, who's this funny guy in cowboy boots that's taking you on a vacation."
You're not sure what... is happening.
I want us to be friends.
I know your mother's divorced.
You're not sure what happened.
I'm very fond of your mother.
I want her to be happy.
I want you to be happy.
I'd like to be happy.
"See, I know your father's real smart and he's a professor and, uh, that's real good."
I'm not trying to replace your father.
"But, uh, you know, I'm pretty smart too."
I sell property around here.
I sell desert land to Arabs.
That's pretty hard.
I'm trying to make this all work out between us.
"If you give me a chance, maybe it will."
"Well, what do you say?"
"Yeah, well, you should think it over, okay?"
"Okay, now, let me warn you, he's going to try to get away with murder."
I've seen him reduce really experienced babysitters to mush in one night.
I've got a little brother like that.
[mother] you do?
How do you handle him?
Either I ignore him or I sock him.
"- [laughs] - [""'The Sunset Trail""' playing on TV]"
"Hey, look, he likes ice cream, so later on, if the two of you want some, here's some money."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"- Hey, are you decent?"
- [men singing on TV]
When has that every stopped you?
I need to connect more with Lucas.
I thought you guys were already doing that.
"I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far."
Can you help a girl out?
Yeah.
You know what?
Give him this.
Travis.
"Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him."
Great.
"Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?"
Just friends.
"I know, sorry."
You're a goddess.
Did you finish 'The Little Prince'?
"No, I just rented the movie."
This book is stupid.
"Nathan, you're not going to pass French if you keep renting movies."
"Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read."
"So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?"
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.
"Wow, what did you say?"
I didn't know what to say.
Nobody's ever asked me that question.
"Wow, that's really big."
"This last couple of weeks without it,"
I mean if I didn't play I might actually have a life.
- What would you do?
- I don't know.
At least I'd have some time to figure it out though.
"Besides, I'm sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?"
NICK:
You want me to go undercover as what?
A member of the 12-step program.
"Aw, come on, captain."
"It makes sense, Nick."
"You weren't at the crime scene, and..."
Nobody knows you're a cop.
"There's a bit of a catch-22 here, captain."
I know.
Your vacation.
"Look, I wouldn't have called you in if I didn't need you."
Tell him.
"They're stonewalling, Nick."
Nobody wants to say diddly about the victim because it's part of their code or something.
It's a dead end.
Unless I become one of them.
Got any bad habits?
Maybe it'd do you some good.
"Nat, what do you think of 12-step programs?"
I think they can be very helpful for some mortal addictions.
How about the more exotic ones?
You know my theory about that.
It's the blood that keeps you from coming over.
"I try, Nat."
"I really do, I really try."
Do you think a 12-step can make me give it up?
"No one can answer that for you, Nick, but it wouldn't hurt you to give it a shot."
When I came here three years ago...
"I was on my knees, almost literally."
I felt like a complete and total failure as a human being.
I hated myself.
I couldn't see any way out of my addiction.
Maybe they're pack animals and they're marking me for later.
I don't know.
"Dave, I was in a car accident once, okay?"
"And it was really scary, I had nightmares."
But when...
"I've been in a car accident, too."
Have you ever been bit by a shark?
I was never bit by a shark.
I'm just saying that I understand.
My...
Say it again.
I was in a car accident.
"No, say the last part."
I was never bit by a shark.
That's it!
Then you shouldn't talk about it.
And I'm not gonna sit here and try to explain myself to a bunch of black and white suburban trash who don't know a damn thing about the ocean.
"And you understand the ocean, honey?"
"I have some real field experience, honey, yeah."
I had a shark attack.
I'm part of a very elite group.
Like people who have been struck by lightning.
Not everyone can say that they've had that and maybe that's what's going on here today.
You know what?
I don't want to get in an argument with it.
I really don't.
You know what?
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.
I'm gonna go back to the room.
You want to come with me?
"Baby, I thought we were gonna go to the waterfall tonight and have a little alone time."
"I want a little bit, i want a piece of it, i think he's losing it, i want to watch it come down."
"Don't like the look of it, on't like the taste of it, don't like the smell of it."
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better ?
"Shove it up inside, surprise !"
Lies.
Stains like the blood on your teeth.
"Bite, chew, suck."
"I want to break it up, i want to smash it up, i want to fuck it up."
I want to watch it come down.
"Maybe afraid of it, let's discredit it, let's pick away at it."
I want to watch it come down.
Come fucking down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better ?
The pigs have won tonight.
Now they can all sleep soundly.
And everything is all right.
"Come here, motherfucker motherfucker"
All the pigs are all lined up
All the pigs
All the pigs are all lined up.
All the pigs
All the pigs are all lined up.
All the pigs
"No, no"
All the pigs are all lined up.
"You know, Horace, it's time."
It's time for you to claim a fucking life.
"You sat out the first half, now it's time of you to make something of whatever time you fucking have left."
- I didn't sit out my life.
"- No, no, you most certainly did."
"You and fucking Pete, both you guys."
"You guys together, like, you were half a guy each."
"Together, you didn't didn't even add up to a whole."
"Now, he is gone."
You have a chance to be a person.
"To live a fucking life, I don't care, Horace, Iâm saying all of it."
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
"I don't know, Iâm sorry."
"- Okay, well, there's something you need to know, brother."
Iâm leaving.
- You are?
"- Yes, Iâm going."
Iâm getting the fuck out of here.
"You can do what you want, but Harold and I are leaving town on Monday and that's it."
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
- Where?
- Where-- I don't know where.
"See the country or whatever, just-- Just not here, though."
- You're telling me that now?
"- Yes, now."
"Yes, now, Horace."
This is all you fucking have is right now.
Do you understand?
"I almost died and I got my fucking life back, and Iâm not spending it here, there's no fucking way."
"I hope you don't either, Horace."
Why should I wanna rise above it?
Because its standards are low.
Its people spend their time trying to drag each other down.
I don't want to be perfect.
I don't want to live in a test tube.
"I just want to be me, and have some fun, and have some friends."
I'd rather be liked than be perfect.
"By liked, you mean being pawed by an animal with one thing on his mind."
Don't make it sound like that.
"Everything has to be learned, even kissing."
And sex?
Is that what you're going to practice at your next party?
You keep trying to accuse me of things I'm not even thinking about.
I don't want you to get a reputation for a half-hour's carelessness.
I already have one.
The wrong kind.
"I want you to fall in love and at the proper time, to marry a man who respects you."
I want you to have a good name.
I want...
You want!
You want!
You want!
Is that all you can say?
"Well, if any man would ask me, I'd run away and become his mistress."
Don't you ever let me hear you say a thing like that again!
I don't know why I said it.
I don't know why I said it.
Allison.
"Hello, Trudy."
"- Hello, Allison."
"- Hello, Joey."
- Selena'll be out in a couple minutes.
So you have to look for the open spaces.
"It's really dangerous, but basically, you have to, like..."
"You have to just get, like, aggressive in there."
You know how it is.
"You know, you're like, ""oh, this guy's gonna lag back?"""
"I'm like, ""I will totally get in there."
"You're taunting me."""
"You know, it's like all this stuff."
Do you watch to see who's on the phone
- 'cause you know you can totally jump in front of them?
"- Oh, yeah."
I take photos of license plates when I see people on the phone.
"I'm like, ""amateur hour!"
"Get the [Bleep] Out of my way!"""
That's what I would have said.
You can edit that out.
"Now, as a woman with style, I feel like you probably can tell a lot about a guy by his car."
Right.
What would you think about a guy in a Corvette?
What kind?
What year?
"Let's say a Corvette Convertible, yellow, 2010."
It's not gonna be for me.
That's okay.
[ Laughter ]
"A little older, and then it's sort of ironic and funny."
"And then I'm like, ""this guy's got a great sense of humor."""
Is he wearing...
[ Laughter ]
"""He's got a great sense of humor."
""" Yeah."
Is he wearing a chain?
"- No, I didn't."
"- Yes, you did."
"Shit, did I really?"
That's so weird.
I don't understand why people wanna get married.
[SIGHS]
They don't.
- They don't?
- No.
"No, no guy actually wants to get married."
"And if they do, all they're really thinking about?"
All the women they're gonna miss out on.
"I don't wanna be with anybody else, just Beth."
"I don't know, man, I..."
Why'd you get married?
I love Janine.
You're a happily married guy.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'd say so."
"Now, I know I don't need to tell any of you that my cousin Paige is hot."
[ALL LAUGHING]
"In high school, if I told the popular guys that Paige was my cousin it'd keep me from getting my ass kicked because no one wanted to blow their chances with her."
[ALL LAUGHING]
And when she gets up there and says those marriage vows to Devon there will be hearts breaking all over the world.
MAN:
"Hear, hear."
WOMAN:
That's sweet.
"But, you know, keep in mind that her sister Beth is still on the market."
"Yeah, sure, she may be an older model but she got a lot of good miles left in that tank."
But don't stay on the lot too long or next year's models are gonna slip in there and steal all...
"Okay, that's enough of the speeches."
The refinery is a bit further down there.
"- Come on, let's get away from here!"
- Come on!
Go back or the whole depot will blow up!
The train has to get away from here.
Go back!
"First, we have to get out of here."
- We must get away as fast as possible.
- Yes.
"Out of the way, damn it!"
We must get away from the fuel depot as quickly as possible.
Hurry!
See if you can find something to force it open.
We can get out through there.
"It's really incredible that you got out, Padre."
"Come on, let's go."
Almost a miracle.
"Come on, hurry up, everybody!"
Gómez has the situation in the north under control.
This time the bastard won't slip through our fingers.
This time I'll get him.
"This is where he was last seen, and this is where we will wait for him."
Are you listening?
What's the matter?
Carrasco's trapped.
He doesn't stand a chance now.
He made a mistake.
He is forced to cross the Cañonda Sierra.
He's finished.
"Luck will be with you, as long as I'm with you."
I shall leave no stone unturned to try and keep you in power.
Everything's quiet here.
is this what we were missing?
What were we missing?
Why do you bang that bottle down on the piano?
That's my livelihood!
You shouldn't put it there!
I paid for it.
Isn't it undignified to take the bottle with you?
It's not undignified.
You ordered Martell.
"You left it there, you acted like noble ladies."
Miss didn't want to dance...
For heaven's sake!
For heaven's sake!
I only spoke to those boys on her behalf.
You only spoke on her behalf!
Why did you need to do that?
Why did you have to say that?
What good is that to us?
And what does the Martell matter!
Here we lost thousands...
"Heavens, you made such a fuss there, until now we haven't been anywhere, and when we do go, all you care about is one Martell... all you care about is one Martell..."
People were paying thousands!
But I have to watch the budget.
It's always only you!
Your budget!
Always only you!
We've had this for years.
"Years, and now you even... I told her I didn't need to go there."
She even made an expensive dress.
This is an expensive dress?
"The dressmaker laughed, she called it a rag."
So what kind of modern dress does she want?
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
It means I could shoot you from Texas.
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
"I know, I know."
"It's always a tough lesson to learn, to realize that you don't have the stomach to do what's needed."
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with meat gravy and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames put on some string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
"So, I was home for about an hour."
My plan was to start the dinner early so Karen and I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta for her trip later that night.
"I kept looking out the window, and I saw that the helicopter was gone."
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your uncle Michael.
So I asked my brother to watch the sauce.
and Karen and I started out.
"Oh, God."
I see it.
- I see it.
"Look, it's right there."
- Damn!
- That's it.
- There it is.
We got to get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.
"Go inside, tell your mother not to touch anything outside the house."
Nothing.
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
Let's go shopping.
"I'm not nuts, it's been following me all morning."
I'm telling you.
Fine.
"Things didn't work out with Mark's dad, so, that was the end of that."
- Why didn't it work?
- Is there any more soup?
You were together and you got pregnant.
I didn't love him.
There was someone else before who...
"I also left him, even though he was the one who..."
"Well, it wasn't to be."
That's all right now.
I need to take this.
You can stay as long as you like.
And I'd also be happy to have a picture of...
"- Yes, what's up?"
- Why did you stop me?
Your Special Branch guy deserved to die.
You've seen what he's covered up.
Where is Emilie Zeuthen?
"I need your help, Luna'."
We know you didn't take her to Jutland.
Is she alive?
The book lists 12 black cars that day.
One of them picked up a little girl.
I need names and social security numbers on the 12.
I'll take care of the rest.
"No, give yourself up and give me Emilie, then I promise to solve the case."
I'll call tomorrow night to get the names and social security numbers.
I can't give you that.
Doesn't your daughter deserve for the case to be solved?
Your blood matches hers.
"I promise that her killer will be punished, but you need to give me Emilie."
I 'll get a copy of the car numbers in the morning and then I 'll start'.
OK?
"When the exchange opens, i'll be down there buying, buying, buying!"
All right.
I warned you.
"Thank you, commodore."
Ha ha!
"Luke, get my carriage."
It's time for me to charge the enemy.
No.
"I'm not gonna let you budge from this office, jim."
It's worth your life.
You think i'm going to back down now because of those hot-air threats?
You think i'm scared?
You could fight just as hard back of that ticker as you can down in the gold room.
That's a great idea.
I'll stay here behind the barricades.
"Before the exchange opens, you go down there and tell my brokers to keep on buying."
"When gold reaches 200, i'll march down there in glory."
"After this is all over, you can do all the parading you want to, but you don't have to go down there today!"
"Oh, yes, i do."
"When gold reaches 200, i got to be there to collect a bet."
"Are you going for me now, or must i spoil a good idea by going myself?"
"I'm going, boss."
Buy and keep on buying.
Buy!
"Buy, she is."
"You boys watch that door and don't let nobody get in there, you hear me?"
I want to see jim fisk!
Aah!
"I'll bid 25,000!"
I'll buy it.
Any more bids?
Who's got gold?
"Well, I only have the one, and right now, he's putting a tv in my bedroom."
It's cute.
"At my place, he sat next to my computer."
"Oh, well, here he'll live in the garage."
Do you like that?
He does like that.
The garage?
This guy is a hall of famer and won 20 games six years in a row.
This is not the actual guy.
Fine.
Sure seems like a lot of my stuff's being relegated to the garage.
"All right, I'll find a place for this little fella."
"Great, and since you're loosening the reins on the sports memorabilia, let's find a spot for this ebay treasure."
"Gosh, we're running tight on wall space."
"Uh, what about downstairs bathroom?"
Fergie Jenkins in the garage?
Gale Sayers in the crapper?
"I don't think you're really from Chicago, lady."
"Well, I know that this is tough, but come here."
But it's just temporary.
"Soon we'll have our own place that's not mine, not yours, but ours."
I guess.
"And we'll have so much room, you'll be able to have your own den."
Really?
"Oh, yeah."
You can put all your stuff in there.
"That'll be cool, right?"
Like a man cave.
Exactly.
Can I smoke cigars in my man cave?
I don't really see it having a window.
"Wait, it's not gonna be an actual cave, is it?"
"It's heading straight down, right for Kelso sitting in his convertible."
I'm done.
"I'm out of a job, right?"
Wrong.
"At that second, a hawk flies in, grabs the thing and flies off with it."
I know what you're thinking.
We're in a city.
What's a hawk doing there?
I can't believe you get a locker and I don't.
"Dr. Reid, I need to meet you in Radiology to go over some test results."
"Yeah, it's over, Ricky."
I know you're stealing trays.
Stop it.
Buzz off.
"Carla, the orderly lost my chart for Mr. Tyler in 406."
Would we have his dosages?
"You put him on penicillin, but he was allergic, so you put him on vancomycin."
Thank you.
Wish you put some of that crazy-nurse memory to use on our missing dude.
"Well, he was an older guy and he was on an IV, so he couldn't have gotten very far."
He was jittery and he had this weird circle tan line on his arm.
It was the nicotine patch.
He was trying to quit smoking.
Should I not be out here?
"There he is, Mr. Spot on His Lungs."
"Don't worry, we'll pop that lung out, get it to the dry cleaners and have it back to you after five."
We like to have fun.
I made up that whole hawk story.
Yeah.
I know you're not as weird as you want people to think you are.
[Clangs]
[# Tammany Hall NYC:
That's quite the Friday.
"Trick, a pint, please."
"The Ash, he's pissed, huh?"
"I told him you got there after and that we both arrived too late, so you're off the hook."
So you covered for me?
This Jenny thing's a serial killer case.
It's scored me some big points in the cop world for breaking it.
Let's just say it's returning the favour.
Cheers.
Yep.
- Still a douche.
"- Well, at least he's not a thief."
I seem to be missing a 300-year-old bottle of buckthorn mead.
You Fae and your funny words.
Look at the time.
I should be going.
Stay and let me tell you how that bottle came into my possession and why it meant so much to me.
So I was thinking.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
- No. it's good.
Listen as recent events have suggested mixing emotions and sex can get kind of messy.
- That is what I was trying to avoid.
"- Yeah, well, I get that now."
"My offer does still stand, though."
I'm here whenever you need me.
How about for more than just healing?
- How about for fun?
- For fun?
Yeah.
"There's this ""friends with benefits"" thing that I have heard so much about."
- You don't say.
"Yeah, and you're actually kind of perfect."
And what have you got?
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
- How could that possibly matter?
"- What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
- It means everything.
- What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
You think you're not a part of this?
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
- Safety's off.
It's good to go.
- I don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
It calms his angry soul.
"You want to ask me about Trina, don't you?"
"No, I just wanted to say sorry for..."
"You loved your wife, didn't you George?"
You were happy?
"Well, we had our moments, but..."
"But yes I did, and um..."
"Yes, we were..."
Yeah.
I loved Trina too.
I don't think she ever really loved me.
Not really.
Deep down inside I always hoped she'd come back.
Even after all this time.
"You were the one who sent the postcards to the kids, weren't you?"
"I know people, plumbers, from all over the world."
"We talk, plumbing, you know, online."
I'd get them to send blank postcards from their country.
I'd copy Trina's bit of scrawl as best I could.
"Christmas cards, birthday messages, love Mummy."
And then I would courier the cards back to my plumbing mates and they'd post them.
I didn't want the kids to think that she'd just left them.
Forgotten them.
"It's bloody stupid, really."
I probably just made things worse.
You were trying to do something good.
We try to make up the loss as best we can.
"Yeah, well sometimes it's just not enough, is it?"
"It gets better, Bill."
"Not every day, but... ..trust me it does."
You hung another one of my paintings.
Yes.
We could've picked them off easy.
"Jacoub, we're good, if we stay in this direction, yeah?"
"Yes, that way."
No point in rescuing Clare if we can't all get out again.
"You do want to get home, don't you?"
See your wife?
"That's a wedding ring, right?"
What about kids?
Got any of them?
"Okay, no kids."
Your marriage is shit.
That's starting to make more sense...
Don't fucking shrink me!
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
I know self-loathing when I see it.
How reckless that can make a man.
That's why I'm here.
"Only I want to rescue Clare, not die trying."
"Now, we're professional fucking soldiers."
We got a job to do...
You're not a fucking soldier.
"You're a scumbag arms dealer, selling mass murder."
"So, yes, you should fucking hate yourself."
"That's why Clare hates you too, right?"
"But that's your shit to work out, not mine."
I don't give a fuck if she forgives you or not.
I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
And that's to get that information on Latif.
No...
Which I'm starting to think is just some bullshit... story you're selling...
I'll keep my part of the deal.
"Really, Crawford?"
You are not going to destroy my family.
"I wouldn't let that cow, Jeanette, and I won't let you."
That's why I had to kill her.
"All right it's over, Mr. Barr."
I said it's over.
"She didn't care about James, about the family."
A money-grubbing tart.
"He'd given her shares in the company, in her name."
His shares.
Didn't tell me.
"Our American partners were ready to buy them strip our assets, junk us."
It was business trouble.
She was using that.
She wanted a million pounds to sell back the shares.
And so what if she broke us?
And the affair?
"There was no affair, just that day."
"I met her in the hotel, to try and persuade her to sell the shares for a more reasonable sum."
I thought she'd agreed to everything.
She was playing me.
I'd always had... she could look at you and make you feel... it was blackmail.
That's why she did it.
You see in the end
I didn't have a choice.
So it was a question of business.
What about your brother's first wife?
That wasn't business was it?
That was jealousy.
Because that was the one thing of your brother's that you couldn't make your own.
So you took it from him.
Hey George!
"Come on, wake up!"
That's not what I'm saying.
"Yeah,it is.That's exactly what he's saying."
"Go ahead,man,you kick his white ass."
Shut up!
I'd just like to come home once and not hear doors being slammed.
She's 12.
"I had a friend who got so tired of it, he actually took his daughter's door off the hinges."
It's like a battleground every night.
She's trying to manipulate the situation.
"She asks me if she can sleep at a friend's,I say no."
"She asks you,you say yes."
What's wrong with this picture?
I didn't know the parents weren't gonna be there.
But I did.All you had to do was ask me.
"Oh,so now I have to ask your permission to make a decision about my daughter?"
Come on.
That's not what I'm saying.
Ok.
"So,when are the depositions?"
Friday.
I get the pleasure of defending your ex.
Is that what this is about?
Wyatt did the right thing.So did you.
Yeah.
That's a great defense.
I'll remember that.
"Daniel,come on."
Don't walk away.We have to talk.
Don't make me stop this rig... sometimes this job just seems like a job.
"These depositions go wrong on friday, we'll all be looking for new ones."
"Hence,the bad mood."
"Lawyers expect you to lie, so you tell them the truth and throw 'em off their game."
Thank you.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
So are you gonna tell me why you're on the run?
You wouldn't believe me.
I'm not so sure I believe me anymore.
- Try me.
- Promise you won't laugh.
Why would I laugh?
"Okay, two years ago, I'm sittin' at home, watchin' a ball game."
- Dodgers are losing.
- I hate the Dodgers.
- You wanna hear this or not?
- I'm sorry.
"At the same time, on the other side of the city... there's some guy robbing a bank, dressed like a clown."
- A clown?
"- Yes, a clown."
It seems that some jerk had knocked off several banks... in a clown outfit.
"The media, in all of their originality, picked up on this... and labeled him the red-nosed robber."
So I'm coming out of Osco's a couple days later.
There's two cops waiting for me.
"Bang, they haul me in."
- Why would they haul you in?
- Let me get to that.
I was stuck in Sonoma.
The only job I could wrangle was playin' a clown at kids' birthday parties... which wasn't such a bad gig.
"Flexible hours, a lot of free cake."
"One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax, sees the story on the news."
She calls the cops.
"They get a search warrant, crash down the door, find the costume."
- It's all over.
- Did you have to wear those big shoes?
I knew you'd make fun of me.
I knew I'm an absolute phoney here.
And that is the closest I ever got to...
You went to school with the lead singer.
"And yeah, probably once took a punch for him or something."
But that's the closest my pro golf career ever got.
"That's what Take That's like now, though, isn't it?"
There's only three of them left now.
"Yeah, but it's the worst ones, isn't it?"
The worst ones are left.
I've a lot of respect for people who just leave at the...
"Like John Deacon was the bass player in Queen and I think after Freddie died, he went, ""Right, I'm out."
"""I'm done."
"We had a great band."""
"And that's it, whereas the others keep appearing at the top of Buckingham Palace."
"I love him, though."
Brian.
Do you love Brian?
I love him because...
I just love him.
I love how passionate he is about badgers.
"He's really good at the guitar, isn't he?"
"No, I don't care about that."
It's the badgers and the foxes and stuff.
I'm a big animal lover.
Is he into badgers?
Do you have badgers in America?
I'm sure we do.
We're killing the badgers over here.
We're killing them off because they're - what is it?
"Apparently, they've got TB."
"They've got TB and they're passing it on, so we're culling them."
People are against it.
Then do you want me to put some boiling water into the thermos?
You should wait for me.
How far away are you from the office to here?
Here.
Stamp it.
"You take the stamp, I'll keep the book."
"Everytime I run an errand, you stamp one."
It'll be completed after 200 stamps.
"You won't simply alter it, won't you?"
But what if you also have exact same stamp?
Then how about you hold onto the book as well?
I've already set up all the pages.
You got the stamp so you can't back out now.
"If that stamp is that important,"
Why didn't you just accept the check yesterday?
"I'm telling you, do you think money can solve everything?"
About the kiss... don't you think you should apologize for that?
The kiss?
"Hey, its only a hello."
"If an apology is not enough, you'll get rid of me, right?"
"You're just using me, aren't you?"
"Thanks to you, I wouldn't have to sit on the floor as well."
What's wrong?
It's not like it was your first kiss?
You.
Could it be...
Is it really like that?
Really?
Ah... please get it stamped quickly.
Really very unlucky.
Overarm throw.
From the side and below the armpit.
You think I killed that boy?
That question will never come up between us.
Why not?
It's going to come up in court.
When do I go to trial?
They're bringing in a judge and swearing in a jury right now.
I'd like to set up a time we could get together... and maybe make a preparation or two.
What for?
What are we going to talk about... if we don't talk about whether I killed that kid or not?
"Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom alone for a minute."
You ever see so many bars in your life?
I guess that's why they call it a jail.
"- I've been free all my life, John."
- I know that.
"Look, it's damn important you don't try to break out of here."
"I know you can do it, but it's just admitting your guilt if you try."
"Christ, I can see those hills over there, but I can't touch them."
Cowboys.
Schoolteachers.
You sure are good company.
"Yes, but do you care for me?"
That horse over there... is the only thing I've owned for a long time.
He thinks the whole world of me... and I've never even given him a name.
Was he good company?
Yeah.
- Do you care for him?
"- Yes, I do."
"Tom, you're an idiot."
"Yeah, I know."
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.
How'd you do that?
"Then I think I'd better be going, too."
Since my being here is useless.
"You don't mind, do you?"
"I must say, what a letdown."
"Really, all that trouble for nothing."
"It's your fault, sending a telegram like that."
That's enough!
Don't you blame Tateo.
I made him write that.
But...
I don't see what is wrong about writing the truth.
Stupid!
"They did drop the atom bomb, and they resent being reminded of it?"
"If they don't like it, they don't have to remember it."
But I can't have them pretending ignorance.
They claim they dropped the flash to stop war.
It's already been 45 years now.
But the flash hasn't stopped war.
They're still killing people!
But you know... war is to blame.
People do anything... just to win a war.
"Sooner or later, it will be the ruin of all of us."
"Now, let's go to the arrival lobby."
There's still time before he comes out.
But...
I feel sort of depressed.
If he came here because of what my mother said...
I don't want to meet Clark.
Shall we run away?
I feel really awkward about introducing Clark to Grandma.
So do I. But it can't be helped.
Don't you think what we are doing might not be the right thing to do to Clark?
- You're all right.
"Somebody's going to snap you up, wait and see."
You saw what happened in Boise.
What happened?
Didn't you see all the guys in the diner breaking their necks to look you over?
- I didn't see that.
- Sure.
How often does a girl like you come into a place like that anyway?
"Now, you see, in the morning we'll take the old elevator down... and we'll be on our way."
I wish it could have been you.
It would have been better.
You go to sleep.
I think you should go back.
Back where?
He wasn't even sure where he was.
- What if it was them?
- He wasn't sure.
You did the right thing.
Let the National Guard go look.
- It's what they're there for.
"- Ladies, would you mind holding it down?"
I'm trying to think.
- What if it was my brother that was down?
"- Now, quit!"
I don't even want to think about that.
- Edgar'd go after him.
- You don't know that for sure.
I think he would.
"You marry a mail-plane pilot, see how anxious you are to send him off in one."
"When the time comes, we all have to take care of each other."
Nobody else will.
You'd hold your breath every time he left and wouldn't let it out until he'd come home.
"Mystic Falls is our home, Damon."
They took that from us.
"Our land, our home."
It's time we rebuild.
"What, are you crazy?"
That was 1864.
"Wake up, woman."
The world has moved on.
"As a reward, I'm willing to give you what you want most."
- I want nothing...
- Katherine.
You wouldn't even know where she was.
You've been underground a century and a half.
Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls.
"I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her."
I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again.
There's no way I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
"I'm not asking for your help, Damon."
Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness.
The rest is nonnegotiable.
"I have 400 years on you, little boy."
"I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking, and you know it."
I'll be in touch.
You got me flowers.
"Well, I figured it's a date, why not do it right?"
"I would have driven too, but you're the one with the car."
"You know, you'd think that for someone who was around when the car was invented, that you'd have one."
"Oh, I have one."
I just never drive it.
"You know, it's not too late to cancel."
Why would we do that?
I don't know.
- Who the roses from?
- Amber.
"Damn, those are nice."
Must be her apology for yesterday's behavior.
"Nigga, you sent these to Amber to apologize to her."
She just sent them back.
- I did?
"- Yeah, you had me do it."
"Wait, you don't remember this?"
"Oh, yeah."
"It's still nice, though."
What kind of red is this?
Rose red?
I don't...
"""Are you an enemy of the league?"" What does that even mean?"
"Well, it's a threat, Joe."
"I mean, it's really fucking subtle, but it's still a threat."
"Well, they can't do shit to us."
"Actually, they could ass-fuck us multiple ways, starting with our registration."
"- No, they couldn't."
- They can and they will.
"- Well, that would suck."
- Yep.
"They could also take away that ASM box we have at the Dolphins' game, too."
"- Oh, I love that box."
"- Yeah, so do I."
It's also a matter of credibility.
"The league can go after that, too."
"Let me tell you something, for two guys who didn't start off with a lot of that, we don't have shit to spare."
What's their fucking problem with you anyway?
"It's an old boys' club, Joe, all right?"
"I ain't old enough, I ain't white enough, and I sure as fuck ain't clean enough, and neither are you."
I am thinking about my daughter.
"Tammy, we have some hard stuff... to talk about."
Your dad is in a coma.
From being stabbed?
He hit his head.
And Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
We're doing everything that we can.
"Look, I know this is really hard and I know you don't want to talk about it, and believe me, I know what that's like."
"But your mom's in trouble with the police, and I don't want her to be in more trouble."
"And this should not be your responsibility, but she says that it's all her fault, what happened, and... well, I don't believe her."
And... if you told the police what really happened... well...
I'm supposed to say it was an accident.
But it wasn't?
No.
No.
"Tammy, look, whatever your dad did... it wasn't him."
"I was cutting a cantaloupe, and my dad came in."
He started singing with the radio.
"He was being funny, but I got so mad."
I don't know.
It just cos over me.
My dad could see it was happening.
"He held me to calm me down, but I bit him."
"And he yelled for my mom, and they both tried to stop me."
"I had the knife in my hand, so I stabbed him."
And now he's gonna die.
I see you have a new rug.
Pete tells me you're afraid to leave the house.
"I said that you could come see the baby, not shrink my brain."
Your body language is telling me that you're uncomfortable.
My vocal language is telling you that I'm fine.
Really.
He wasn't?
He knew.
It was just one of those things that happens.
"He was growing up, and that was hard for you both."
"He loved you very, very much, Mr Watson."
And that's what he was thinking when he died.
I just wish I could see him one more time.
I wish I could tell him that I was sorry.
"He knows, Mr Watson."
He knows.
( cries )
"It's okay, Dad."
You can let go.
Now I can see why those people want you so badly.
"When it gets dark, we shoot for the windows again."
"At the same time, we bring two men through the hallway."
"He'll be down on the floor, won't be looking to the door."
We've got a man up in the heating ducts.
"He'll coordinate by earphone, drop down through at the same time the two men from the hall enter."
And then he turns and shoots the girl.
That room is covered by snipers.
These men know what they're doing.
"It all goes by the numbers, we take him out."
- And the others?
- Not a problem.
I don't want my father to see you do it.
You look like a college kid doing his homework.
- What are you working on?
"- Oh, just a little theory."
"Their craft was, I like to call it, thought-powered."
"Allie may be a stronger manifestation of that power, that energy."
How long have you been sleeping with my daughter?
What happened?
- Is she dead?
- She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that.
I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
More light and light it grows!
"More light and light, more dark and dark our woes."
- Madam!
- What is it?
Your mother is soon coming to your chamber.
The day is here.
Be careful and make haste.
I shall be gone.
Your parents cannot know that I have been part of this deceit.
"Farewell, my love."
"One more kiss, and I'll descend."
No.
Come this way.
I'll teach Benvolio to learn your news each day.
"No, more than that."
Each hour in each day.
Each minute in each hour is a day for pining lovers.
And amen to that.
Do you believe we'll ever meet again?
I do not doubt it.
Nor that we shall smile to think of all these troubles in the past.
If God would only free me of foreboding.
"I think I see you, now you are below, as dim and pale as dead men in their tombs."
"So are you dim, love, in dawn's drab light."
Our worries make us pale.
So adieu.
"Oh, fortune, fortune, all men call you fickle because no fortune ever constant be."
"If that is so, then change again, oh, fortune."
Be fickle now and send him back to me.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Please, Benvolio, be a guardian angel to my love."
Watch her firmly and gently as it would do the eye of God.
"- Yeah, we have a great blooper reel."
- My God.
I wanna see it so badly.
- Click on over.
- Stop this commentary immediately.
"- Hey, that was my hand."
- Kat Dennings does her own inserts.
Because nobody else can do it right.
"I don't think that my hand acting in the scene with the toilet ended up in there, right?"
That was cut?
"- No, your hand is..."
- When she looks in the hole and my hand goes over it.
"- No, that didn't make it."
- They cut that out.
- That didn't make it.
"- God, your fault, so hard."
If anyone's gonna get raped in that van...
And this is so...
This gets a huge laugh.
"Sorry, I told you I didn't think that rape line was gonna work."
Yeah.
"No, it's fine."
Did you tell me that night?
"Yeah, because you guys started bringing the scene in..."
You started to re-create the scene and it was going really well but then that rape line I thought was never gonna work.
It was never gonna play funny.
But it's one of the biggest laughs in the film.
I think that some people definitely won't like it.
So I think your instinct was...
- I was playing it safe.
"- Well, rape isn't a joke, Michael."
- What'd you say?
"Anything you can do for that, uh, for that little baby, please, do it."
"I'll get out of your hair right now, okay ?"
I'll come find you.
"I'll be right there, all right ?"
Okay.
Thank you.
"Yes, of course."
You feel that ?
Darryl ?
"Hey, Seth."
How's the earthquake treating you ?
"Uh, not too well."
I need to ask for your help.
"Sure, but how can I help you ?"
"Well, I'm guessing you don't have a, uh, like, a car or a walkie-talkie ?"
This shopping cart's my only worldly possession.
"Okay, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for it."
"Sorry, no way."
I'll give you my pants.
"No, no, they look better on you."
Listen.
"It has a flat tire and possibly a broken axle, but it's a $70,000 car and it's all yours in exchange for the cart."
Sweet.
"Stay here, I'll come back to draw you a map."
Because... it's a rabbit.
"It's a he, and I'm aware of his species."
but that doesn't mean that he doesn't feel pain and that he isn't hurt.
"Please, if you have a shred of humanity, or animality in your body, you won't deprive this poor, little, adorable bunny of quality medical care."
"Well, I did do a year of veterinarian school."
Really ?
"Maybe if there's an X-ray machine free, I'll..."
Thank you.
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your God."
What say you to Thursday?
"My Lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow."
"Thursday it is, then."
"Come, gentle night."
"Come loving, black-brewed night."
"Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars."
He will make the face of Heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.
My husband.
My wife.
Must you be gone?
It's nowhere near the dawn.
"You heard the nightingale and not a lark, I promise."
She sings each night sitting in yonder tree.
"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn."
No nightingale.
"Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east."
"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
I do not think the light is daylight yet.
I am content if you would have it so.
I have more heart to stay than will to go.
"Come, death, and welcome."
Juliet wills it so.
I will lie with you and say it is not day.
It is.
It is.
Go now.
Begone.
Away!
"Oh, it is the lark that sings so out of tune with horrid discords and unpleasant sharps."
"Oh, hurry now."
"And third of all, sex in public never goes according to plan."
That's true.
You always just realize how much gravel there is in the world.
"All right, nice and calm, hand over your wallet and your purse."
"Okay, man, look, just take it easy, okay, I..."
Wow.
"Oh, my God, thank God you're okay!"
Are you okay?
"I don't know, my girlfriend stood me up at a mugging."
I can't believe you just stayed with him.
I didn't just stay with him.
"He's not an injured bird, Whit."
He kind of made my attendance mandatory.
"Okay, why didn't you call me?"
"Ah, the mugger wouldn't let me borrow the phone that he mugged from me."
Why did you run?
That's what you're supposed to do.
That is not at all what you're supposed to do.
Even the mugger thought that was weird.
"Everybody knows that when a couple gets mugged, you're supposed to run in opposite directions."
He can't shoot both of you.
"No, just the guy still standing there next to him."
I thought you knew what to do.
I do.
You do whatever the guy with the gun is telling you to do.
"Give me the phone, I need to call the police."
Why?
We're fine.
I'm not fine!
I was mugged!
Because you didn't run.
It's like you have the brain of a deer.
"If they know me and I go to school with her, then she... I don't know who she goes to school with, I don't go there."
"You talk the most, but you haven't shown us anything yet."
Then I'll show you...
Those kinds of dances didn't exist when I was young.
What is this dance called?
- Are you going to start now?
"- No, we're finishing."
"Don't they teach you the polka, only those modern ones?"
"They do, but there's no room there for such things."
You can't dance the polka?
Where do you dance?
"The polka is almost like skipping around, and where can you... lt's a kind of rhythmical skipping to a polka..."
Don't you know some tune?
The polka melody's like this... lt'll survive three generations.
"I'll tell you about one polka you know, it's gone round the world."
You of all people know it!
"Wait, wait!"
I'll show you.
Roll out the Barrel.
That's it!
It held the whole world together throughout the war.
"That's music, the real thing."
Let's try it!
"Mummy, play one of those... I'm already playing."
"Better something else, the tango, for example."
Better the tango.
I'll show you how it should be danced.
"Slowly, just hold me."
We'll just move our bodies like...
people in love.
In love?
She's eighteen!
I have traveled to China on a merchant ship once.
Would you like to work as a navigator of our group?
"Yes, I will do my best if you'll hire me."
Same here.
I will build a brewery in Chunghae.
I need men to work at the brewery.
- Select the workers.
"- Yes, sir."
"If you work hard, you will be fed well and make money."
But I hate lazy men.
You will be fired the moment I catch you slacking off.
Hire the rest of them as our workers.
"Yes, sir."
We need to start trading in order to create more jobs.
And we need to wipe out the pirates in order to do that.
It will take more time to wipe out Yum Moon and the remaining pirates.
Grand Chief.
What is it?
The leader of the Palmi pirates has surrendered with his men.
My name is Pil-ryul.
We heard you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us into your care.
- You know Yum Moon?
- Yes.
Where is he?
I don't know where he is.
How could we trust them?
We can't show you our true mind.
We can't also make you trust us.
But we risked our lives to leave the base.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
Or you have to destroy someone else.
"If she hadn't busted her knee, I wouldn't be here."
You don't feel bad about taking her place?
"By the time she left, I think she was done."
"I mean, she didn't say that, but she started partying, not caring as much."
She was ready to go.
I have a friend who seems like he's doing the same thing.
Then maybe it's time for him to go.
"Look, I know it's harsh, but that's this world and this city."
It's kill or be killed.
And I don't just want to survive.
I wanna thrive.
That's very Darwinian.
That's right.
It's the most natural thing in the world.
So you can't feel bad about it.
Amelia was right.
"To make it in this city, you have to let your animal instincts take over."
"And in that moment,"
I knew I was going to write this piece and thrive.
So you don't mind if I ask you a couple more questions?
Of course.
And there's nothing you want me to take off the record?
Nah.
This world is so screwed up.
Let people see it.
Wow.
You got her to reveal so much.
Turns out we had a lot in common.
"Well, I'm terribly glad this ended up on your desk."
I don't think anyone else could have written this but you.
- Well done.
You want to sell that?
"It ain't for sale, and you ain't gonna crisscross me out of it!"
No?
Perhaps we can give the commodore a few ideas.
You're right.
"Tell you what- wait a minute, wait!"
You boys are gonna ride in my buggy.
I've been figuring a mighty while how to get even with cornele.
You are coming in with me on erie.
"Uncle daniel, we'll be in your office in the morning."
Our office.
"Oh, uh, nick- will you go in and talk to josie?"
Keep her company.
Lot of people in here i got to see.
What's the matter?
It's jammed.
That's my patented burglar alarm.
I wanted to be sure i'd catch you when you came out.
"You go over and sit down, and take it easy, old friend."
"Well, what's on the docket for today?"
Here's the usual hungry ones.
Take care of them.
"So... so you're the new member of our firm, huh?"
Do you approve?
"Well, i'll say this for jimmy- he certainly has an eye for beauty."
But i don't think that women and business mix any more than oil and water.
"We poor, helpless women certainly have to fight for our place in your man's world, don't we?"
Ambitious?
Very.
Do you think that necklace is going to make you a better actress?
"No, not a bit."
But i like wearing it and i'm tired of working in a dressing room.
No need to wait here any longer.
He hasn't got the plans.
- We'll see you later on.
- Splendid.!
"Splendid, old boy.!"
I look forward to it.
Might have a spot of lunch at the club one day.
And don't forget to give that message to your superiors.
I know they'll be relieved to hear that.
Good morning.
I tell you the girl must have them on her.
They weren't in her room and she didn't give them to Wooster.
Why not let us go up and get her?
There's no use in being diplomatic.
"From now on, you two keep away from her."
- I'll handle this in my own way.
- If that's the way you want it.
"- Remember, this girl is clever."
- That's why I propose to take care of her myself.
I'm going to meet her in the lobby and then take her to the private garage.
- What about that Wooster?
- You don't need worry about him.
We'll take care of Mr. Wooster after we've got the girl.
"And, remember, we can't afford to fumble this time."
I've wired the chief in Paris that I'll be with him tomorrow.
"Here, you'd better put these in the safe until we get the other half."
"I'll take that, Mr. Manville."
"And now, what have you done with McDermott?"
"- If you'll give me those plans, I'll tell you."
- Don't move.
Don't panic.
She can't hurt you with that.
"You mean, sir..."
"You mean, if she was dead, he couldn't get it off?"
"Well, she is, I believe, isn't she?"
"Well, yes, sir."
But he could have asked her for it first.
Before he shot her.
I remember Claire trying to get that ring off at a party once.
Some silly game people were playing.
She couldn't.
Not even with soap.
And you can check that out with her husband.
He was the one that asked her to take it off.
He was on the other team.
"Boy, when you say you studied, you aren't kidding, are you, sir?"
"Well, then, what about the alligator bag?"
An alligator bag that is six years old is apt to be worn-looking.
It doesn't look like it's won'th very much.
It probably isn't.
"How do you happen to know all that much about her bag, sir?"
I gave it to her.
"Well, that takes care of that, doesn't it?"
Right.
"Well, I guess, then there's only the credit cards, sir."
If the killer is an idiot.
"I beg your pardon, sir,"
I don't quite follow your meaning there.
"Well, you don't kill a woman and then sell the credit cards with her name on it."
"The police have been known to bribe fences before, you know."
"Well, of course."
"I'm sorry, sir."
I should've thought of that myself.
"Jeez, I guess you're right, aren't you?"
I tried to teach this little nigger dog but he just didn't get it. you know what that little fucker did?
He bit me.
You know what happened to that little dog?
My father shot it right in the fucking head.
But you know what I remember also about that day?
My father was still not satisfied.
So I'm not going to kill you.
I don't think I'm going to get the emotional closure I need out of that.
Instead I'm going to fuck pointy tits over here right in the mouth while you watch.
And then I'm going to have Carlo shoot you in the fucking head.
l might get some satisfaction knowing that you'll go to the great beyond wondering if I'm gonna keep her or kill her.
That depends on how good she is.
Fucking step over here now!
Nice doing business with you boys.
Thank you very much.
kid.
- You too.
Love to do it again sometime.
See you around.
don't you think?
That's because dipshit got us lost on the way over.
come on.
don't hang around here too long.
Take it easy.
You take care.
if you're ever in town---
You got it.
Can I drive?
You're lucky you're not walking.
That's a lot of money you got there.
Yeah.
Are you really gonna do this? I think so.
"Unfortunately, there is no time rest."
"Come on, dude."
We'll also have something to eat.
There are only 100 days left for the exam.
Do we even have time to eat?
If I have to calculate; we have 6 hours of school everyday that makes 18 days.
We have 82 days left.
"If we take an hour or an hour and a half lunch break... that makes 9 days, 73 days left."
"But hey, I thought we'd solve the problem we've been dissolving ourselves."
What is this dude?
"8 hours of courses on the weekends, makes 5 days."
We now have 68 days left.
We sleep for about 8 hours a day.
That makes 34.
We're left with 34 days.
Extra lessons for 3 days a week 3 hours each; adds up to 6 days. 28 days left.
We spend a lot of time on the road...
"We also have to shower, go to the bathroom, wash and iron clothes."
We should also count the homework and these meetings too; 5-6 hours a... day.
We have 3 days left.
"For your information, in 3 days, he'll say, ""Let's steal the questions."""
You can't imagine how happy you have made me.
"So, I'll be able to see you as a university student."
Of course you will mother.
Why shouldn't you?
Hey guys!
Hello man.
You look great.
You look just like one of us.
"Hey, you look really smart."
It's not enough to just get dressed in a smart way.
"Hi girl, you are back!"
"But the chief - the one with the white hat, not the ones with the yellow hats - the one with the white hat came over to me and said,"
"""Did you stop the traffic?"""
"And I said, ""I thought I ought to,"
"""because I was worried it was going to explode."""
"And he said, ""No, that was a really heroic thing to do."
"Well done."""
"So, I go, ""Yeah, well, you know."" LAUGHTER"
"""Who WAS that man?"""
And um...
"So, I go home and Jane said, ""What did he say?"""
"I said, ""Oh, you know, he called me a hero - fairly standard..."
"""It wasn't..."
Doesn't really matter.
"""We'll forget about it."
"The less said, the better."""
"But, yeah, he said that was an amazing thing to have done, and, um...he said that he wished he could be like me."
But I gotta get back in the game.
So...
I'm gonna have to borrow your trust fund.
Wait.
You came all the way here to ask me for my money?
"Well, that money is mine."
"See, I gave it to you, so I can take it back."
"Actually, legally, it's my money, which means I get to decide what happens to it."
"Look, it's just gonna be temporary."
All right?
Just to get the blood-sucking bankers off my back.
And what have they ever created?
"They're just living off of guys like me, and now they won't give me what I need to make it back."
Maybe they're worried you'll lose it again.
"What, you think this is easy for me... come here looking for help?"
It's not.
It's no sense feeling shitty about it...
What can i...?
You know... that doesn't change the truth to what the fuck happened.
So fuck it.
"On the Marquis outside on the first, they say the show has been cancelled."
"Then, let's get a straight story for the press so it's not turning to what it isn't."
Then I think it should be the truth.
Absolutely.
He's got the end of his fucking finger cut off...
"Yes, absolutely."
He tried to do the show and passed out backstage.
We can't do the show.
"Thank you, that's fine."
I just need to hear it one more time.
"Well, there's nothing like another stressful day."
It sucked.
Keep rolling.
We will leave.
If we don't have a show tonight in 4 hours...
Ok?
And it doesn't matter if we run it or not.
"Everyone is gonna be fired, ok?"
We run it manual or we cancel it?
A or B choice.
What does that mean?
"For the show we do this week, we have no lights at all"
"We have house lights, we'll have to do with house lights."
"Well, that's not good enough."
Why are we in this position ?
The production is always be aware of exactly where...
"Well, the 2 guys who make the decision are me and me."
I am not aware until right now that the lights are not ready to be performed.
WATCHlNG AN INNOCENT SUFFER?
"YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEN YOURSELF THAT WAY, HAVEN'T YOU?"
I AM INNOCENT!
"OH, I KNOW,"

"817 01:07:16,100 --&amp;gt; 01:07:19,300 - Today I bought my bag."
- Congratulations.
"818 01:07:19,351 --&amp;gt; 01:07:22,903 Guess what Orkun bought me?!"
"819 01:07:25,600 --&amp;gt; 01:07:28,116 I wish there was a problem because you didn't buy the bag."
"820 01:07:28,116 --&amp;gt; 01:07:30,669 So.."
I have two of them.
"821 01:07:30,669 --&amp;gt; 01:07:34,397 Let's put one in the fair, for the women who are victims of violence 822 01:07:34,397 --&amp;gt; 01:07:36,600 No, this would be violence against a girl 823 01:07:36,676 --&amp;gt; 01:07:38,560 Her heart would ache."
"824 01:07:40,929 --&amp;gt; 01:07:45,346 - Come with me Eylül and help me."
- Okey.
"825 01:07:54,000 --&amp;gt; 01:07:56,700 I called you so many times."
"826 01:07:56,746 --&amp;gt; 01:08:00,466 I know..."
But I'm still not over.
"827 01:08:01,600 --&amp;gt; 01:08:03,433 What happened?"
What?
"828 01:08:03,433 --&amp;gt; 01:08:07,900 You should tell me."
After me you were with him the whole night.
"829 01:08:08,000 --&amp;gt; 01:08:10,800 The house was on fire because of you two."
"830 01:08:12,200 --&amp;gt; 01:08:18,100 Look.."
I don't know what you are talking about..I do not know what you're facing...You're being ridiculous.
"831 01:08:18,100 --&amp;gt; 01:08:22,500 By the way you can't do this to me..."
"Because, I..."
"832 01:08:29,500 --&amp;gt; 01:08:34,100 Really..."
"Today, I don't wanna talk about this..."
Okey?
Please.
"833 01:08:34,200 --&amp;gt; 01:08:38,600 Okey."
It's better.
"834 01:08:38,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:43,200 Everything is okey..."
And that guy is back to his place where he belongs.
"835 01:08:48,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:50,900 Yaman is free."
"836 01:08:54,300 --&amp;gt; 01:08:56,600 He is by the Serez's."
"837 01:09:03,800 --&amp;gt; 01:09:07,900 It's obvious you become a mother very young, the same as me."
Do you miss me?
"1171 01:40:34,510 --&amp;gt; 01:40:36,471 I'm going to sleep."
"1172 01:41:43,600 --&amp;gt; 01:41:47,500 Dialling Hasan..."
@chastybelen
"1174 01:42:37,900 --&amp;gt; 01:42:39,800 Mom !.."
"1175 01:42:41,028 --&amp;gt; 01:42:43,348 Mom, where are you going?"
- Go back to sleep.
"1176 01:42:43,583 --&amp;gt; 01:42:46,017 MOM!"
"1177 01:42:47,074 --&amp;gt; 01:42:48,868 Why is that guy here?"
"1178 01:42:49,112 --&amp;gt; 01:42:50,991 I called him.. 1179 01:42:51,500 --&amp;gt; 01:42:54,000 What are you saying, mom?What did we talk about ,mom?"
"1180 01:42:54,618 --&amp;gt; 01:42:57,000 We don't need nobody else... 1181 01:42:57,019 --&amp;gt; 01:42:58,218 And especially this jerk."
"1182 01:42:58,243 --&amp;gt; 01:43:00,498 I called and apologized."
"1183 01:43:01,400 --&amp;gt; 01:43:04,800 No !"
"- That's how I am, 1184 01:43:05,100 --&amp;gt; 01:43:07,700 This is the way i am."
"1185 01:43:07,800 --&amp;gt; 01:43:10,700 I can't let Hassan go... 1186 01:43:10,800 --&amp;gt; 01:43:14,800 I love him.. 1187 01:43:15,200 --&amp;gt; 01:43:17,800 You are lying.. 1188 01:43:18,478 --&amp;gt; 01:43:21,676 My way is obvious."
My companion is obvious too.
"1189 01:43:22,290 --&amp;gt; 01:43:24,991 I will not let you mom.- No one asked you... 1190 01:43:25,300 --&amp;gt; 01:43:29,000 Look at this crazy boy."
"1191 01:43:31,600 --&amp;gt; 01:43:33,600 I don't deserve you."
"1192 01:43:34,500 --&amp;gt; 01:43:37,800 You deserve the best, my son."
"1193 01:43:42,465 --&amp;gt; 01:43:45,105 Mom.. - I love you."

"Overrated, right?"
I needed something really unique
Just then
I saw a strange woman
One more time?
She never smiled
Like she had a dark secret
I can't really explain it

I followed that mysterious woman
It felt so strange
How should I put it?

"Next one's about a three hour walk away, it's at point 17."
And that's if we don't get lost.
Connor:
Is there anywhere safe we can stop on the way?
Amy:
We need to let someone know we're down here!
James:
There's a mainframe computer room about half way round.
We can send a message from there.
Amy:
Ok.
(Electrical flickering)
Connor:
Which way now?
James:
We have to go that way.

"Oh, you're breaking up on me"
"Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy."
"K-kinda busy, K-kinda busy"
"Sorry, I'm ignoring you, I'm kinda busy."
"Just a second,"
It's my favorite game we gonna play
And I cannot text you when I am in my mercedes
"Why can't you just take a hint, I need some time for me"
"My dudes are at my place and we are kinda busy,"

He's TlNY!
"Even the mythical creature he's based on, the Tsuchinoko, is typically described as around 10 to 30 inches long- tops!"
"But in the official games, little Dunsparse is- er-"
WHAT?!
4 foot 11 inches???
But. . .uh
Why you make him so little?
I-I don't understand.
"Joining Dunsparce in the things-that-are-way-longer than-you'd-think club is Dratini, another serpant like Pokémon."
He's the first pokémon in his line so I've always thought of him to be the little guy.
WRONG!
5 foot 11 inches.
Longer than the average height of humanity.
"Also, this was always weird to me."
Dratini:
6ft long.
Dragonaire:
13ft long.
Dragonite:
7ft long.
Where?
Where does it all go???
Let's check out some spherical pokémon.
"I've always pictured guys like Glalie, Fortess and Gastly to be around a foot long or a little bit bigger than a basketball."
NOPE!
These guys are actually all 4 to 5 ft long.
See this guy?
See that giant ball?
That's a 5ft beach ball! and THAT is what your Glalie is gonna look like in real life.
"And yes, It is terrifying!"
"At last, at almost 48 feet long, Wailord is by far the longest pokémon in existence- over 17 ft longer than the second longest, Steelix."
"But weight-wise, Wailord doesn't make ANY sense."
[Laughing]
Ohhh...

"Dropping two EMP's, checking out that Dark Templar actually."
"But MC is coming back with a scary force, that is going to sandwich.."
-	Cloak!
-	And look at this!
"The Ghost goes trying to drop EMP, and they do on the majority of the units."
"This is about as good as it can get for ThorZaiN, doing some drop ship micro actually."
Taking..
Oh My God!
-	Ohhhhhh....
I think we should just have a moment of silence and hold hands at what we just saw here.
What is going on!?
"- Alright, we have Medivacs loading."
- Oh my God.
"Watch this, he is going to drop all over the mech army, this is going to be so sick cool!"
"Oh, I am so excited."
SlayerS BoxeR!
You are the funniest player ever!
- He is moving out.
"He unsieges, he may siege up again, but when he sees that many Vikings, he is going to have to land the Vikings!"
- He is..
Here comes the Medivacs!
- Oh my God!
"- Dropping all over those Siege Tanks, just crushing trough!"
"SlayerS BoxeR has out strategized GanZi, completely!"
-	Marines really want to catch the Corruptors.

Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."

Keep an eye on him.
"Yes, I'm eyeing him, uncle."
I'm eyeing him.
But now I'll keep strict watch.

"Second man, out of shot:"
"Look at his face, this filth."
[One man laughs.]
Another man:
They shot us with live ammunition
Cameraman:
One bullet in his leg and one in his stomach.
Another man:
"For God to bless you, put him in the morgue."
Man out of shot:
Pick him up with me.
Several voices:
"Slowly, carefully."
"A soul, a soul."
One man:
"This is a human, in the end this is a soul..."
Another man:
"Arrange his arms properly, arrange his arms."
Cameraman:
Was he shot yesterday?
Or today?
It looks like it was from yesterday.
Another man:
Where are his ID cards and stuff?
Cameraman:
"I don't know, search his pockets...the guys must have taken them."
Another man:
"He's not Libyan, I don't think he's Libyan."
Cameraman:
"He's stiffened, you can't arrange his body properly."
"It must be from yesterday, not today."
[music]
"After about a week, you won't be able to notice the cut."
-Baek Eun Jo  -No Ri.
Thank you.
My parents... are coming up on an evening flight.
Uhmm..
They must have been very surprised.
The doctor complimented you.
He said your quick actions made the surgery easier.
"If you hadn't told me how,"
I wouldn't have been able to do anything
It's a type of obstruction to the intestines.
I had no idea.
I really... had no idea that such a scary thing could happen.
I will call my dad.
He must be worried.
Oh Ha Ni!
"Ah, my cellphone and my wallet... where did I leave it all?"
"I, really..."
How old am I that I'm already...
You know..
That rumor with Kyung Soo sunbae...
He explained everything to me already.
Thank you Oh Ha Ni.
I was afraid... that I might do something wrong.
"So, something might go wrong with Eun Jo."
Everything is alright now. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It's the first time that I heard.. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;warm words from Baek Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Since my anxious feelings were all relieved... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;My eyes and heart... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I cried so much they nearly melted away.
Hello!
Hi Eun Jo.
Omo!
You made it today.
The flowers smells good.
It's Oh Ha Ni again??
He can't change without a blanket or fan
He can hid inside the thick mattress
Move it away
Let's watch inside.
You do it
Do it
Yes， do it
I can't with so many eyes looking at us
Ok， let's push up the bed 1， 2， 3
Act fast， but not too hard， or we can't hold it
It works
Darling， can such a wedding night be recorded in the Book of Guinness?
Landal How come?
What happened?
She's kicking me
I didn't
No?
This bed?
Why's everything missing?
Why?
I beg you， or I can't get reincarnated
You're crafty， you've changed into a bedsheet
Take it out and burn it
Don't!
Tsung， bring gasoline
Let's go out first
Keep and eye on him
Don't burn me
Don't let him go
Come on， sprinkle it on him
Keep away， let me
You're taking away my girlfriend?
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
I'm going to run away...
"Are you crazy, Mahir?How will you escape from prison? no"
I'm running away from the hospital!
"Enough talking,Gentlemen!"
"Come on,Get back!"
Come on!
Take it easy.
Feride?Are you crying?
"This is due to Mahir, right?Now you cheer upAfter you've seen it, I know it..."
How can such a big lovefinished in a minute?Is this possible?
"Feride...listen to me,I know you're very angryat Mahir, but trust mewhen I tell youthat Mahir loves you!"
"Everything is explained,he did everythingto save his father..."
He did not intendhurt you... . trust methat he is a very good man.
"Maybe it's becausewe want to bevery good man, Bahar!"
Maybe he deceived usin fact we believe that he is good?How can we be sure?
Maybe he hidits darkness in the same mannerthat he hidhis real name?
He was shot in the street...no one knows who did it... he deals with the gangsters...
And above all he is accused of so manyillegal stuff!
"But, he said,it's all justto rescue his father!"
Feride
"You should have listened to him,certainly there is an explanationfor all."
I do not want to hearhis voice or seehis face ever...
Okay.
"As you wish,All right."
I'm going to bringsome water ..

"Okay, we're coming in..."
"Okay, first of all-- and I'm sure he hears me by now--"
let me explain something to you.
"Everyone, can you hear me loud and clear?"
My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
"See you later, L.A."
We're going to San Francisco.
"See you again, L.A."
We just arrived in San Francisco.
"Before MV filming, we're going to San Francisco hamburgers."
"Tigger here, Tigger there."
"Lately, fans have been sending a lot of Tiggers."
We have so many Tiggers at home.
"Tigger staring at me here, Tigger staring at me there."
I'm freaked out.
They look like they're alive.
It looks like they're alive and staring at me.
oh my gosh!
This street is called Union.
The weather's kind of chilly here too.
None
It's a different feeling from L.A.
San Francisco feels a little more antique.
"Very vintage, and each building has its own character."
lf I were to choose between the two cities
I'd pick San Francisco because it's more put-together.
"L.A. is nice too though, it's very casual."
I wish my neighborhood were San Francisco.
This place has a different aura to it.
They're in the same country but they feel different.
"It's a city that goes well with our song ""Coffee Shop"" too."
Just a little bit ago there wasn't this much sunlight.
Thank goodness the sun came out.
Zelo is filming right now.
It's a relief the sun's shining brightly.
I have a feeling today's shoot will be a good one.
I'm done.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.
"Okay, come..."
We have a lot to tell each other.
"Wait, wait..."
"Uhm, well..."
... could you turn your back to me?
- Why?
- Just do it will you?
Kuzey.
Don't lose it again.

The way we can square on most calculators --
"let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square."
"On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster."
"What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method."
"What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,"
I will try and race you to the answer.
OK?
"So quickly, a two-digit number please."

You didn't see what he did to us
"Like I told you before, we have to cope with it till the condition stabilises"
And when is that?
He sold everything and withdrew the money
That's Alzheimer's
The patient acts in confusion and then stabilises
Hopefully he'll stabilise and tell you where the money is
Did he even have Alzheimer's in the first place?
"What about the medication we use to give him, Mr.Karim?"
Did you forget?
Screw all this
Nothing to detect these units.
-	Ghosts cloaking.
"They are going to try and EMP all of the Sentries, if he does, he can go in for an attack."
EMP on the entire army!
His entire army is EMP'd!
He Stims and goes in to finish them off.
If he destroys this army he will win the game and advance to the round of 16!
So many Marauders!
The Vikings taking out every single Colossus and BoxeR is on the verge of winning the game and the series.
"Here he goes in, stimming one more time, the Medivacs healing everything."
"Avenge on the run, falling back into his expansion, we might see a GG any moment now."
-	Ohh..
And a Nuke!
"-	Nuclear Missile, dropping onto Avenge's natural expansion where his army is right now."
The Nuke's gonna land on his army!
"-	Ohh, is he going to get his units away?"
-	Ooooohhhhh!!
-	Nuclear Missile killing everything.
"-	BoxeR, 100 supply ahead."
-	Winning the third game!
"- With those Vikings you shoot forward, trying to get rid of those Colossi."
Not overcommitting his ground units quite yet.
And uh..
Actually lost quite a few Vikings in all that.
Choya is giving him chase and going to chase him right into the main base.
"There is the defensive nuke, if he can hold this wall right here, he's got it."
The nuke could go down right in the middle of all these units.
- Oh no!
Oh no!
And it looks like..
"Oh no, Choya!"
- Ohhhhhhh!!!
"Until then, that name did not exist."
"And so, the name ""christian"" was made to name Jesus's disciples."
"Christian, in its true form, it is the disciple of Jesus."
Jesus's follower.
But Jesus wants followers?
He wants disciples?
Of course!
The last word before going to the heavens was:
"""Therefore, go and make disciples."""
The last thing He said!
"Normally, the last words of a man is the most important thing, the legacy he will leave."
Jesus said:
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
He begins with this.
Matthew 28.18.
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
"""Therefore, go and make disciples"""
"Of where? ""of all the nations."""
From all places.
"""I want disciples, in all places,"""
"""of all nations."""
How to make disciples?
He answers:
"""Baptizing them in the name of the Father,"""
"""the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"""
"""and teaching them"" what?"
"""To obey everything I have commanded you."""
"""And surely I am with you always,"""
"""to the very end of the age."""
"So, in this job, I will help you."
I don't see the point when I can just use an actual joystick.
"And what's really weird is that this thing, again, is just a piece of plastic."
"It doesn't have any wires connecting to it, you just plant it there."
And the buttons actually work!
"And it steers okay, too."
"To tell you the truth, I'm stunned."
Ass!
"So, that covers most of the dreaded NES accessories."
"But, I know that there's one in particular that I didn't mention, but, you know, can't do it all in one shot."
"So, we'll save it 'till later,"
"I'll see you next time,"
I think you know what's next.
Western illinois Women's Soccer returned home to face Grand View last week Sunday.
"Head Coach Tony Glinn used much different starting line up then in previous matches, but it payed off early and just in the 11 min of play Senior forward Amy Unzicker recorded her first career goal to put Western up 1 nil."

"Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,"
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.
"Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?"
How about a two-digit number?
Audience:
22.
AB:
22.
"And another two-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
47.
AB:
"Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working."
"Do all of you get 1,034?"
"1,034?"

No.

Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
(Applause)
"Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?"
"OK, great."
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
That's OK.
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
"There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself."
"For instance, five squared would be?"
Audience:
"Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"

Streamers it is.
What?
Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Do you not like the color?
"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Do you not like the shape?
"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler."
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
All we ever want is indecision
All we really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
Making sure we make a good appearance
Even if you simply have to fudge it
Make sure that it stays within our budget
Got to overcome intimidation

DR. JAMES GRlME:
"This is such an inspiring story, because it shows how mathematicians can save lives."
We're talking about one of the most famous cipher machines of all time.
It's a code machine called the Enigma machine used by Nazi
"Germany in World War II to send secret, coded messages."
And we've got one over here.
This is not a copy.
This is not a replica.
This is an original Enigma machine actually used in World War Il.
This was made in 1936.
It's an army Enigma machine.
Let's see how it works.
So this belongs to a man called Simon Singh.
He's an author.
He writes popular science books.
And he lends it to the University of
"Cambridge, where I work."
"This was found in a French field, I was told, by an"
American cryptographer after the war.
And he took it home.
So I guess he took it home as his souvenir.
"Yoink, that's mine."
The guy who found it died about 12 years ago.
"And when he died, that's when Simon"
Singh bought the machine.
We're going to send a message.
"Now, we were talking about what to send before, so we send Numberphile."
Let's turn this into Enigma code.
So I'm going to type in N to begin with.
"And if you can see there, the letter Y lights up."
Quick recovery.
Thank Godyou're good.
Who's in?
He would not say who it is.
"I hope it is not a false statement,I woke up in the middle of the nightcome here!"
search and browse!
"We found it ,Mr. Prosecutor! bravo"
Issue an order to the police stationfor whoever rented this store.
"At your command,sir."
"Mr. Mahir,Did you see who shot you?"
"Yes, his faceis engraved on my memory."
Can you describe him?We'll find it for sure.
"It was dark, boy hasAbout thirty years cheeks and eyes, skinny, and his eyebrowsdark prominent."
That's it.
Right.Do you know this man?
I do not know...I can not remember...
Can you remembersomething else ?
"Mahir just woke up,"
"Leave it to rest,let it bother."
"Brother Yassine,There is another thing,arrest warrant."

"If we know somethingabout who shot you,we'll let you know. thanks"
"Thanks, Atif."

Who wanted to kill you?Who is this bastard?
Describe it to meI will find him and punish!
"I saw his face,"
"I said to myselfI know this man, but where..."
"But where,I can not remember..."
Can I come in?
"- Our Father, who art in heaven..."
- Emily?
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs? - as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread...
"Emily, can you hear me?"
Let's get her off the floor.
"Alice, no!"
"You've suffered a terrible loss, Mr. Rose."
I know this is difficult.
So thank you for being here today.
"Sir, do you often read the Bible?"
"- Yes, I do."
- So do I.
What about the DSM?
The *Diagnostic and Statistical* *Manual of Mental Disorders*... ...commonly referred to as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
- Have you read that?
- No.
So you're not aware that according to the DSM... ...a person's refusal to eat is a common indication of anorexia?
Objection.
"The witness just said he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor."
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose... ...are you aware that catatonic rigidity... ...specifically a locking up of the body's joints... ...is a known symptom of psychosis?
No.
I haven't studied these things.
Have you ever visited an insane asylum... ...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
Once.
My aunt was in one before she died.
Really?
So there's a history of mental illness in your family?
I suppose.
"The vanilla bean, which is expensive and worth reusing."
Today's Episode
Vanilla Sugar
"Here, in this little pot, I'll show you."
"There's all the vanillas I save,"
That I let drying.
Moustache:
The smell is amazing!
"Everytime I make something with vanilla bean, I wash it if I put inside the milk or the cream."
"If I didn't put, don't need to wash."
"Then I put it beside my stove and leave there for a couple of days, it'll dry."
"When it dry, I save inside this little pot here, I close it, I let it quite closed."
"When I have the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar, I make it."
For the vanilla sug...
Moustache:
And what is the enough quantity for making the vanilla sugar?
This is what I'm going to say right now!
"For the vanilla sugar, we will always need the sugar and the vanilla."
SUGAR &amp;amp; VANlLLA
Only.
Nothing more.
Moustache:
"Wonderful, it makes sense."
It makes sense.
And then what happens?
"In this case, here I have 15g of vanilla."
So I need 150g of sugar.
"In other words, we always need 10% of the sugar's weight in vanilla."
So: there's 200g of sugar?
I'm going to use 20g of vanilla.
Moustache:
Wonderful!
"Do not remain silent, and play it cold cynic when the mate is in sorrow"
But cheer him up
What can I say to him?
Anyway he knows the banality
What is this nonsense?
What in this pursuit for the new and not the this basicl?
He does not need anything new!He just needs attention.See that he not left alone with his own sorrow
That's all!
"I can be your friend, buddy."
Why are you so nervous
"Ok,let's make YouTube comments under in this video, the happiest place online."
Put in them the rainbows and the respect for each other
Write something like:
"For boys, that the girl no longer with them I suggest this and that"
"Or someone who reads the response, you'll have only good ... something like this ..."
We have fun and heal with words

Europe on average uses
about half as much as Americans use and England is a really low water user.
They use about 40 gallons per person per day.
"So, now this cup, this is another continent."
It's representing 22 gallons per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Asia. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah.
Asia.
Yup.
"Now, we have another continent."
This is 12 gallons per person per
day.
Any guesses?
It's Africa.
"And the last one, this is one of the lowest water-using"
countries in the entire world.
It's representing 1.3 gallons of water per person per day.
Any guesses? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A country? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
It's a country.
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rome. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
You're close.
Yes.
It's Gambia.
So it's one of the lowest water users in the world.
"So, we just wanted to start with, you know, how much water we do use."
"In the United States, we have a lot--we have a lot of water and we use a lot and so we're excited to talk about some better ways to use that water. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
"Thanks, Laura."
OK.
"So just picking-up off that theme, a few more questions for you."
"Anybody want to have a guess at what the recommended amount of water per person is recommended for basic sanitation and health needs, per person?"
"Charles, you should know this one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WARREN:"
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:

"""I am alive just to meet him."""
"""His gratitude made me Tiger from a human being."""
"What""s the deal, sheikh?"
Do as Pasha says.
Go where he sends you.
Diamond worth 15 million pound is going to arrive.
"Diamond? sheikh, you said gold is going to arrive in lndia."
You are great!
Do smugglers ever speak the truth?
Go to Alaska with Pasha!

"Yes, Alaska! - okay!"
Deal is done!

"No, I am not angry!"

I have heard that Tiger singh and you studied together in England.
And I have also heard that shekhar is your best friend.
"And then finally, we have 13/15."
"To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180."
152 = 30.
"So, 15*12 = 180."
"Multiple numerator by same number, 13."
"We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156."
"So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator."
"Now, it is very easy to compare them."
We only have to look at their numerators.
"Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers."
"The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4."
"And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5."
"Next is 156/180, which was 13/15."
"Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12."
"And, we're done!"
We have finished our ordering.
"HI my name is Allison and I'm the president of Communication Conections,Inc., a nonprofit for families hearing loss.I'm sitting in my favorite place-my garden."
I love all of my flowers.They are beautiful and I have a variety of them.
I work hard to have them grow.
"But my favorite ones are sunflowers.Sure,they are pretty and yellow."
But why do I love sunflowers the most?
It's because they start with such a small seed and you add water and they start to grow.
You add sunlight and they grow more.
"Then all of a sudden,they grow HUGE!"
I was shocked when I saw how big sunflowers grow!
I never knew how big they would grow.
It's kind of t the same for the new nonprofit.
I worked hard for years as a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing children.
I worked for 15 years and I've seen growth and improvement.
"But,I wanted to see a BlG change."
I started with a small idea and decided to set up a nonprofit.
I researched and aksed people to help me.
Thank you.
Hey interwebs.
"It's Thursday September 17, 2009 and a viewer informs me as of September 15th,"
I have been on YouTube for 3 years.
3 Mo-Fricken' years.
And a lot's changed since 3 years ago.
I'm no longer that person.
"A lot of people will say, ""Man, yeah time flies."""
No... 3 years ago feels like an entire lifetime away.
I was a completely different person then.
I would personally say a worse person.
A person I wouldn't be friends with right now.
"And back then I was just some douchebag witha camera, and now..."
Well I just get paid to be a douchebag with a camera.
And the conversation over the years has given me a lot of insight.
Even you stupid fuckers with your stupid comments.
"Like ""first""..."
Which shows me that even if  you're the first to the show it doesn't necessarily mean you're the winner.
Sometimes it just means you're an asshole.
But change is all around us.
"I mean, given time, a lot of things can change."
Peoples' perception of those things change with it.
"I mean, look at Lindsay Lohan."
She was adorable.
Then she was hot.
Then she was crazy.
Then she was kinda crazy hot.
Now she just looks like a coked out whore.
So still kinda hot.
Lindsay Lohan is kind of my dirty secret.
"If I was single, I would possibly  have sex with Lindsay Lohan."
"Right now some of you are judging me, but I would have sex with Lindsay Lohan for the same reason that I love skydiving."
Shall we play a game while eating?
King Game?
Give it to me.
Jin Se Ryeong's interview isn't over yet.
"Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I plan on getting back to basics.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The place that made me the Jin Se Ryeong of today, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;shouldn't that be my next destination?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Aish!
You refused to listen to me!
"And you just eat! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; ♪ When I look into your eyes,  I can't sleep. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; ♪ When I feel your breath,  I am thrilled. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;♪ You're the girl I am so stuck on."

"The kids aren't giving you any more trouble now, are they?"
I heard that there was an accident during the broadcast earlier.
"Ah, yes."
You needn't worry about it.
It is extremely bothersome to deal with kids that powder their faces.
Aigo!
Is the preparation for going public on the KOSDAQ going well?
"Yes, it is going according to plan."
"Nowadays, as soon as you put up a board (sign), you start making preparations to go public or go overseas..."
We are a little late.
It is the most important time now!
Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations.
Yes.
"I will bear that in mind, Chairman."
Ah!
"Her father the king said, ""Don't whistle."""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Hai, don't whistle."""
But the princess continued whistling.
(Whistling)
"The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully."
(Whistling)
"Her father the king said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
"Her mother the queen said, ""Who will marry a whistling princess?"""
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"""Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!"""
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
(Whistling)
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the king."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the queen."
"But the princess said, ""Father, Mother, don't worry."
I have an idea.
I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly.
"And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."""
"So she went up to each and said, ""Do you accept that I have defeated you?"""
"And they said, ""Me?"
Defeated by a woman?
"No way, that's impossible!"
No no no no no!
"That's not possible."""
"Till finally one prince said,"
"""Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."""
"""Uh-huh ..."" she said."
Don't spoil her life.
Think logically and tell me before 12 o'clock tomorrow night.
Because after 12 o'clock I am going on a test ride.. ..in my past.
Professor I have no time to think.. ..because tomorrow is my parent's 33rd anniversary.
And I have planned a surprise party for them.
Everyone must be thinking looking at you.. ..that why isn't her husband begging on the streets.
You look like Zhaveri Bazaar's showroom.
It's better than looking like an antique piece in the flea market.
How much does she love me?
Enjoy the party guys.
Go on!
"Excuse me, get me a drink please."
I should do all the work.
"Uncle Bhikhu, were mom and dad always like this.. ..or did this happen after marriage?"
They were sworn enemies.
Their marriage was the second biggest mistake.. ..in the history of mankind.
After the atom bomb.
When actually it wasn't their mistake.. ..but your grandparents.
How is that?
They're dead and all that's left of them are their pictures.
But they still don't like staying next to each other.
Your grandpa Rai Bahadur Dhyanchand.
No one ever took his advice nor was he brave.
Especially before your grandma.
And your grandma Bholi Devi.
She wasn't innocent or a Devi.
Wonder why they got their children married.. ..and sent me here as the dowry?
"""If I had wings, I would soar high."""
"""I would show you the anguish in my heart."""
"Here he comes, the great two-in-one."
Two-in-one?

"I wouldn't [laughter]...thank you, thank you."
Joy:
Just lie down.

That'll be $100.

I was trying to figure out were you going to analyze him or teach him.
[laughter]
Star:
I didn't know which one.
[laughter]
David:
It's funny you would say that because [laughter]
"I feel like, I mean in some ways my life would be so much easier if I were just interested in sex."
"There's a whole...I mean, there's some things that I don't have to worry about."
But there's all kinds of other stuff that I do worry about
I mean I can always exchange one big set of worries for another big set of worries.
Elisabeth:
What about when you're dating?
Like if you're dating someone and you've had romantic relationships in the past is this something you come out and tell them right away?
Do you only date other people who are asexual?
"And if the person you're with is sexual, how do you match up?"
David:
I date people who are sexual.
I pretty much have dated people who are sexual.
Elisabeth:
You tell them right away?
David:
"Yeah, and I tell them."
They find out right away.
I mean it's...I'm pretty out.
Let me try to take this one step further.
(Laughter)
I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
You can all take your time on this;
"I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right."
"To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,"
"let's say, one, two, three, four."
"If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square."
Nine.
Seven.
Five.
Eight.
"9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me."

Yes!

Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"Now, I would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately, most calculators cannot."
(Laughter)
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?
"So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?"
Does yours go higher?
Volunteer:
I don't know.
AB:
"Oh, yours does?"
Volunteer:
I can probably do it.
I am grateful to them

She is WOW!
It's the end of year presidential elections and I'm here on the streets... ... to see what citizens really look for in their next presidential candidate.
Someone who is honest and knows how to communicate
I hope that someone who is successful in their field will run.
Someone who is proud for this generation and can blend in with today's values.
If you had to nominate someone?
Announcer Gong Jung Han?
"Gong Jung Han, the announcer."
"If i had to choose, Gong Jung Han."
Do you think he'll really run now?
"If he does, we should vote for him, right?"
We should know what kind of person he is before choose him.
It's ridiculous to vote for him just because he's our next door neighbour.
Gong Jung Han is Jo Ara's Husband.
They're such a lovebirds.
"If her family happy, then wouldn't the nation be happy too?"
Do you think Jo Ara is good?
I'll start the car.
"Honey, please keep our country safe today."
Let's see.
What's this?
Why is this out?
Are you tempted?
Thank you for buying.
My husband was the biggest help before the publication of my book.
He gave up his own study room for me.
And even my son all the way in America helped supervise me writing.
I write this without any exaggerations or lies.
I wanted you all to hear my true voice.
Which part should I read?
It is dropping down...
"Oh, thank God..."
"Yasar, could you please buy these drugs immediately?"
"Look at us, Serdar Bey..."
"I am trying to keep my family together, but..."
"But, I can't."
And mother's heart can bear upto some point.
"Whatever prescription you give me, whatever you tell me..."
Useless...
My only medicine is Mustafa's health... his goodness...
When I see Asiye pregnant and in despair...
When I think about the innocent baby yet to be born...
I am losing my mind...
Be patient...
He is being treated.
"Believe me, the things being done is for Mustafa's benefit."
Tell Narin... ...to see Mustafa.
Help us.
We are falling apart...
We are breaking into little pieces..
This mansion is collapsing onto us.
We are getting burried under its weight.
It broke my heart to see the woman in that condition.
She was begging so desperately that
"It broke my heart...She said ""This mansion is collapsing onto us."""
"""We are getting burried under it."""
We.. stayed burried a lot under those walls...
Nobody heard our voice.
She was about to have a stroke because of high blood pressure...
"Luckily, you were there on time, Serdar."
Mustafa didn't recognize anyone of them.
He doesn't communicate with anybody.
But Edie is not prepared for how difficult teaching Nathan will be.
"OK, where were you?"
The most basic school work is a chore for Nathan and a challenge for his mother.
Nine times six is 54?
Do I put it under here?
Do you remember what to do next?
You put it under here?
"OK, what do you put?"
5-4.
Nope.
5-4.
5-4.
I don't know that.
"OK, I'm trying to remind you."
"By early summer, Nathan's frustration has turned to anger."
"He is kicking doors, hitting his brother."
He loses control.
And that part is what's frightening.
His family is becoming increasingly fearful that Nathan's plummeting self esteem might cause him to hurt himself or others.
Sometimes I can't stop crying.
"And, like, I'm just in my bed with my head down."
I just get sad.
"A little while ago, like last year, I was like, I could just kill myself."
I tried to run away.
I just felt like no one really wanted me to be there.
"Nathan's mom, desperate to do something to improve her son's self image, begins to look outside Bear Creek for help."
An hour down the road are the offices of pediatrician Mel Levine whose specialty is finding out what's going on with kids
like Nathan.
Dr. Levine tests for strengths and weaknesses.
"You know, for kids, success is like a vitamin."
And it's a real vitamin deficiency to grow up success deprived.
Let's just compare it to the original.
What do you think about Poly's look ?
Shocking ?
"Samia: "" It's pretty """
Aren't you shocked ?
"Mark: "" No, not at all """
Who is more shocking ?
Poly or Gaga ?
"Mark, Samia: "" Gaga, of course :P """
"Poly: "" We give our messages in many different ways """
Why are you having this shocking look ?
What you want from this ? being different ? or gaining fame ?
I want the world to talk about me ? and my look ?
"Poly: "" For me, If I was or wsn't a singer, that's what I want to wear """
"Poly: "" that's I express myself , and of course it'll get you fame,but that's not what I'm looking for"""
You go out with this look with your friends ?
"Poly: "" Basically , yes """
"Poly: "" sometimes I wake up not feeling like wearing any wigs, but that's how I express myself """
Poly:
"""Or I will feel like I'm Strangled, This is my loudest voice """
"You wear like this, to express an idea with your voice ? what's that idea ?"
What is he messages in your songs ?
"Poly: "" about expressing youserlves, and I promote recycling """
"Poly: "" and the youth, and the gay community """
"Later, you want to change this look, and talk about an another issue .."
What issue are you gonna explain ?
"Poly: "" Safe Sex """
"Poly: "" That's what I'm gonna do """
How ?
"Poly: "" You'll see """
Is it shocking ?
"Poly: "" You'll judge later, you and everyone watching """
"Poly: "" I have a message, about safe sex """
You've heard of that?
"No It's quite alright, but a bit cold in...from October and into November."
So...
"""I like to pull pranks so much, tjomfallera, tjomafallera, hey!"""
I remember when
"I remember, I remember when I lost my mind"
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
"Yeah, I was out of touch"
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
"Come on now, who do you"
"Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?"
"Ha ha ha, bless your soul"
You really think you're in control?
"Well, I think you're crazy"
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart
To live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
"Is thinking, I want to be like them"
Ever since I was little
Here's our token of appreciation from us to you.
Paul:
"Aw, thank you."
That's a beautiful knife.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Read it."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" What's that say?"
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
What does it say?
Paul:
"It says, ""Prepared for life."""
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"""Prepared for life."""
Paul: ...I'd like to think I was.
Paul:
I let my Scoutmaster down because I dropped out of
Scouting and it's a big regret for me now.
"But I came out here today, I felt like I've redeemed myself."
I think Scoutmaster McCauley would be proud of me.
I really think he'd be proud of me.
"In the last video, we set up this definite integral to evaluate the volume of the solid of revolution that we set up using the shell method."
"So now, let's just evaluate this thing."
So the main thing is just simplifying this expression.
I'll start off by trying to simplify this part of it.
So that's going to be y plus 1.
"I just ate an apple, so something weird just happened in my throat."
"But anyway, that's done with. y plus 1 minus y squared minus 2y plus 1."
I just expanded out this binomial.
And then that would simplify to-- another apple in my throat moment-- so that's going to be y plus 1 minus y squared plus 2y minus 1.
So this 1 and this negative 1 cancel out.
And let's see.
You get negative y squared plus 3y.
"This challenge tests skills for rifle shooting, pioneering, and first aid merit badges."
There are three tasks.
One... ...hit three targets at a 22-rifle range.
"Two, complete the fourth wall of a pioneering tower."
From the top of this tower... ...shoot a slingshot... ...and hit three targets to retrieve this map.
"Three, follow the map to Lake Ida, then handle a life-threatening situation."
"Paul, you and Will are up on the rifle range first."
Go ahead and take your spots and we'll get started.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Get him Big South"
"Will ""Big South:"" All right."
"All right, you guys."
Paul:
I am determined to win this competition.
"I, I want this bad."
And I really hope that my Scoutmaster... ...gets to see me do the best that I can.
Somebody's going to have to cut off one of my limbs to stop me from winning.
"Will ""Big South:"" Honestly, I think the targets are kind of big."
"So I think this is a matter... of speed, and who gets it off first."

All right.
Eyes and ear protection are on both.
Rounds are being chambered.
Will is sighting in.
Stand by.
"Three, two, one, commence firing."
And Will has a miss on his first target.
Paul:
I hit something.
NARRATOR:
Paul's first shot takes down his target.
"All right, Will takes down his target."
Paul is sighting in on his second target.
"Let's go, aunty."
I welcome you on behalf of the Delhi Citizens Committee.
And I request the chief guest to start the function.
In today's function we have gathered to congratulate... ... those brave young pilots... ...who have risked their lives for their country.
And in the process they have set such standards of bravery... ... that every citizen of India is proud of them.
The State has already honoured them and will continue to do so.
But I believe that there is no greater award... ... than the love and good wishes of the people.
The first name in the list of award winners is...
You're surprised because you've seen flight lieutenant Arun Varma.
You look like Arun Varma.
I am his son.
Arun Varma died...
I shall tell you everything after the function.
But permit her presence here when I receive the medal.
You mean...
The person because of whom this day is a part of my life.
She's responsible for what I am and for the award that I'm receiving.
Please permit her to be a part of this happy moment of my life.
I would consider it the greatest honour.
I would also like to meet this person.
Please call her.
Mother...
"Come here, mother."
"Go, Vandana."
Suraj is calling you.
Me?
"- Yes, mother."
I am calling you.
Did you tell Suraj everything?
"No, a son has recognised his mother."
Go.
"Come, mother."
"Needless to say, camel blood is different."
The red blood cells are oval-- not round like a human's.
When water rushes in... the cells of most species rupture if they swell past 150%.
Camel cells can increase 240% without bursting.
A camel may drink more than a third of its body weight as it rehydrates.
In lands barren and inhospitable as any on the planet... camels do more than survive.
They race.
[gunshot]
[camels groaning]
Camels can hit speeds of 25 miles an hour.
The races are big business in the Middle East.
Racing stables in search of breeding stock import wild camels all the way from Australia.
"When it comes to survival in the desert, the camel wins by a nose."
Our first two animals survive storms at sea... and on land.
But flash floods can be fatal to anyone.
[thunder]
NARRATOR:
A storm in the desert.
Short.
Violent.
Sand soaks up rain slowly.
So water falls off hills.
Flash flood!
You can run... but you can't hide.
"In the desert, floods soon subside."
"For the animal crawling into number 8, the water is both life and death."
Desert ants make the most of the flood.
Drinking heavily.
It could be years before the next rains.
[thunder]
"In the Amazon, there are two seasons."
Wet... and wetter.
"Keep in mind how many times he threw up and then, tell the doctor."
Hold on.
Then call the ambulance.
"This is 119, right? after that.."
Bring him to Parang University Hospital.
He's an elementary school student.
I'll get there as soon as possible.
Oh Ha Ni..
Take care of Eun Jo.
It's a type of intestinal obstruction.
An intussusception has occurred in the affected region.
An intussusception?
"It's when part of the intestine folds into another part, sort of like a collapsible telescope."
It's pretty far in so we must operate on it immediately.
Surgery?
Complications can arise due to a perforated intenstine so you need to hurry and make a decision.
But....
What to do?
"It's not a serious surgery. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh Ha Ni, take care of Eun Jo."
I understand.
Begin the surgery.
You came?
Yes.
Eun Jo is having surgery.
I heard about it.
How did it go?
It was as I had thought.
His intestine was folded into itself.
Did the surgery end?
"Yes, it went well, you don't have to worry."
"A part of his intestine was folded into the bottom of it, so we opened up his stomach,"
And returned it to normal.
Doctor
What is your domain?
Internal Disease
Very beautiful
Have you worked in places other than Istanbul?
He worked in so many locations that we forget the number
My mother is right
But the last location would be Istanbul
I mean this is what it looks like
I'm going to see Nakiye
"I didn't expect to get to know you in such occasion, Mr. Murat you can call me Murat only"
Do you have a fiancee? mom what kind of question is this? not yet for now
What are you doing here?
What do I do I could not eat in front of them
My head is spinning from hunger you too take one
It's really very delicious
How did it turn out that delicious with all the rush ..
I don't know does it need more salt?
"No, it is perfect"
Look at what I'm doing?
I'm eating dolma with you
What's happening inside
They're gazing at each others wondering what to talk about they didn't ask for my hand yet?
Did he abandon me? he didn't..
Everyone is waiting for the coffee Nakiye

Really?Tell whether the allegations are true !
"You stole a truck,didn t you?"
"Okay, I understand... we have decided tobring Mahir Karato trial,"
He will remain in hospitaluntil it recovers and then we will take himto prisonuntil the next hearing.
You can go out .
"I could startwith the caseyou were talking about with Mr. Prosecutor,"
So Icould prove...
For this person who is on trial for murderand risks to be sentenced to death...
What? ?
Who do you think you are ?Huh?
Who do you think you areto be able to search for such an important case?
"One of the most important figuresin this country, was killed... killedMy friend and colleague..."
"Do not you ever playwith something about which you have no idea,and want to prove ityou are smart!"
Do you understand?dont Do it again!
Did you knowState Prosecutor?
Do you have any ideawho could kill him?
You with your level of knowledgeyou want to solve it ?!
"Boss,we have not found it yet."
"We've searched,but nothing. he fellinto a black hole!"
He fell!- And then what?
"But we""il find him"
"he can not escape. you will turn everything upside down until you find him,don""t you?"
"Behold, the warrior, you find Ibo or I'll kill you all."
"Now I have somewhere to go,I leave you all to worry about it ."
"All right, boss."
Brother...once again we go back...
Feride hasclose all the doorsfor me and my father...
"She'll hang my father,and throw me in jail..."
"Feride has decided,I know that."
"We'll find a way,do not worry."
"There is no moreno way,bro..."
Just one...
"Well, when the Bradley went down, I flew the guy named Don Hanson."
He was a pilot... coming here all the time.
He had a nice Cessna-180 and the first day...
I have the radio in the basement now.
"Every year, the guy that owns Zenith, it was a fish dock."
Him and my grandfather become really good friends.
From like 1920s or right whenever they started.
"Every time Zenith made a new radio, come out with a different model he gave him a free radio."
He came up in the summer and gave him a new one.
There were Zenith radios with their eyes and everything all over.
And I got the last one.
"Says ""Made expressly for and stolen from"
"Jim Gallagher."" My grandfather's name."
"But anyway, we'd listen to it all night."
We could hear them search and stuff.
"Another uncle of mine, Jack Colton, is in Charlevoix."
He's going to have his 90th birthday here this fall.
He was the exec in the [?].
"And when the call came in, he just took off out with half a crew."
The indicator that tells him it's [?] was painted on both sides.
The engine.
I've been in the basement of one of them
They have different settings.
They're diesel electric.
You go up to like 10 is wide open and then you can push a button and get it up to like twelve.
They went out like that.
Emergency power all the way to Gull Island.
"Those gales, you know nasty."
But the next day I flew with Don and they plowed the runway and just about started to ... up to about that part of the runway.
And it was just slush.
And we took in - As we were getting close to it
The Bradley?
I beg at you.
But... - Otherwise...
"Otherwise, I'll become widow before marriage."
"Don't say that, Radha."
We're with you.
I'll speak truth and none other than the truth.
Inspector Damodar... ...don't you think you should have come in your uniform... ...for giving your statement?
"Your Honour, actually we become little tough in uniform."
While giving our statement we forget the human emotions.
I'd just repeat few lines of this Geeta.
It says... if a sinner confesses his sin... ...and is ready to go through it's punishment... ...he is no more considered a sinner.
"Your Honour, we, the police officers tried our best to arrest Jackie."
And finally what did we get?
Nothing.
Total flop.
Order... order...
"Your Honour, isn't this evidence enough... ...that Jackie has surrendered."
Your Honour.
He was a criminal.
But now he is not.
There's a lot of difference between both the tenses.
We must forget the past.
And think about his present and future.
"If he wants to mend his ways, I'd request the court... ...that the law should show mercy upon him."
"So that he can be a good man, a good citizen... ...why..."
"Your Honour, I think I've said too much."
"Sorry, I became little emotional."
"But whatever I said had some weight, right?"
Yes.
Under the IPC section 362. court orders... ...2 years imprisonment to Jackie alias Jaikishan.
Jackie!
Jackie!
"Detroit and I started going down there, well then that changed that."
She had a good job at [?].
She was the [?]
Detroit area automobile association
They must have a hundred dealers
But she came back to Grand Rapids and we got married and that was it.
Picked up a couple of part time jobs.
And then when the kids got in high school
She didn't work until after they were in high school
And then she started out with a part-time job.
The kids were working part-time.
They went to [?] and Catholic Central
Worked janitor work over at the school and different things
No problem.
They're good workers.
Few grey hairs but that happens.
They didn't get in jail.
So they're both doing good and I'm doing good but we came up here every summer.
We rented over at Archie's.
Archie's Place is there.
We rented there for 30 years.
Even though I'd had some property up where [?] is and I sold it to him and bought this.
What year did you buy this property?
"Let's see, we built in"
"'98, so probably bought it in '94, maybe."
"So, when you say you never left the island?"
"I went some, like, 28 St. Patrick's Days and never missed one."
You never missed a funeral or a wedding or vacations.
We worked 4-day weeks at Spartan so you could switch.
You could work Sunday to Wednesday one week and
"Tuesday to Friday the next, or something like that and get a 4-day weekend to shoot up here pretty easy."
How did your bride like Beaver Island when you first brought her out here?
"Go bring the instruments now, hurry."
"Yes, sir."
Is he not being able to breath?
"Don't just look, please try something."
This is a lethal location.
"Your Majesty, please let us know of your successor."
Please make your decision.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
Your Majesty ...
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
The king has passed.
You've done well.
You've been most helpful.
"But the queen and the young prince survive, as well as the queen's father who has many follower and is from a warrior clan..."
Don't you think I can take care of a woman and a child?
"With her father and left minister (war minister) gone, she won't have a chance."
"Your Highness, we need to do something before the Queen Mother does something."
The Queen Mother has the right to choose the successor.
Do you think they're that easy to persuade?
"Your Highness, if we retreat from here you and the young prince's life could be in danger."
"Also, this is the chef's record."
There were no records for the day His Majesty became ill.
You mean ..?
That's right.
Even the person who writes the record is missing as well.
There hasn't been enough time for them to take the recorder  out of the palace.
"That means, she is hidden somewhere inside of palace."
Inside of palace?
"Yes, Your Highness."
"So, the search and rescue team...?"
"No, this was the astronauts."
"Oh, the astronauts themselves -"
Yes.
They were in with us.
We'd fly out to Houston...
The astronauts fly...
"We just spent like a week, 4 or 5 days or whatever it would be at the time."
And we'd go out and then we'd make changes.
"And back in, and back out."
"There were always 4 or 5 of them or 3 or 4 of them on the plane with us, just..."
And there was that original 8 or 10 astronauts.
Do you recall any of their names?
No.
"We were on missions, you know."
Because that's who the ones were.
So that was -
"I wish we had gotten autographs or something, but then again, you do stuff like this, and it's your job."
Never gave it a thought that it was anything other than a job.
"They were flying on the plane with you, to help you get acquainted with how to rescue them?"
"Yeah, just to see."
"And it was probably to reassure them too, you know, because"
"like I said, the Navy primarily was in the Pacific and then they had another alternate route over there north of the Canaries."
Like between the Canaries and [?]
Someplace in that area.
If I remember right.
"But anyplace in the world, we had a"
C-130 that could reach them within 4 hours.
Any place.
"And our plane was over by Singapore, Hong Kong."
But we had one in Chile.
"And, I don't know, we probably had one wherever the..."
I can't believe what an awkward position I've put you in.
"But believe me, I never planned for this to happen"
"I know, I made your schedule."
This was not on it.
"Stacey, I've been looking high and low### for you"
"Well, maybe you should try getting out of the chair"
That'll increase your odds
"Stacey, I need you to testify for me at the people's court."
"Listen, I can't possibly take off walk."
I'm sorry.
It's a definite no
"Alright, I'll go on### TV myself, fine."
National TV?
Millions of cute guys watching?
"Alright, I'll do it"
"Here, I want you to look at these books."
I highlighted some of the cases that are similar to mine
And I've made some notes on some questions that they are likely to ask.
You know what to do.
"Call up the law library, see if they can dig up some legal precedence that we can cite"
"I'm on it, Paulie."
"Hey, Ma."
I'll be on TV.
I don't know.
Some stupid thing
"We just got together to talk like old friends, and the next thing you know, we wind up in my hotel room"
"If this conversation goes any further, I might be forced to go on a tri-state killing spree."
I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed.
"Nah, look, it's all right."
"I mean, growing up together, we had embarrassing moments all the time."
We did not.
"Just basically, you know, so how do they make their marriage work?"
You're just trying to take the concentration off of the sex end.
You're like where is the relationship?
"Where is our, where is the rest of our intimacy?"
David:
Yeah.
The point is love and sex are different things.
Chandra:
Correct.
David:
"And for a lot of people, they are very lined up and when they think about their relationships, sex is kind of really at the center of where it is."
"But if you set up a relationship and from the get go,"
"I mean, everyone has really close friendships, right?"
Star:
Yes.
David:
"Which are different, but you can form a really close relationship where sex isn't at the center of it."
"And so it's...it's abstract, but it's thinking about how do you form a relationship that's closer, that's more committed than, you know, can be the basis for a family?"
Joy:
But what about kissing and cuddling with a girl and having a little of that stuff?
David:
"Oh, I personally like that."
Joy:
"Oh, you do like that?"
"So, what if the girl gets aroused?"
What are you going to do?
[laughter]
David:
"I mean, she's going to know from the get go."
Joy:
She might change her mind once you embrace her.
[laughter]
I tried a little college.
Picked up a job.
Which was dumb.
I was making about five hundred with my flight pay in the Air Force...
Took a job for a hundred a week when I got out.
I would...
I'd go there for seven years and...
Driving truck where now?
"Oh, just a laundry truck all over Western Michigan."
"We had all the Kroger stores and all the Spartan stores under contract, with aprons and towels, and..."
With Richie Gillespie?
"No, with Richie O'Donnell."
"One of the drivers got hurt, and he knew I was looking for better pay."
And I'd always bonded with him and I went there
I drove there for 7 years.
"I got there, there were 32 drivers, and when they got laid off they were down to - I think it was either 9 or 11."
Synthetic stuff.
"Synthetic smocks, table covers"
"Restaurants quit using cloth napkins and cloth table covers, and the fancy banquet covers, and that was our main business."
"The guys retired, and they'd just never fill them in and never did, and never did."
"So, 7 years later, I was..."
I went to... a year and a half and got a big layoff there.
"'75, I think it was."
What were you doing for Steel Case?
I just worked the shipping department
I was in shipping - file shipping.
"And when I left there - I was laid off from there, and of course, Steel Case always called back, back then, back in the 70s"
I couldn't get a job.
"I was working 3 jobs, $2.50 an hour."
Bartending on weekends for the Amvets.
Because they wanted a guy there Friday and Saturday.
Mowing grass for another guy for $2.50 an hour.
"POLlCE STlLL CAN'T IDENTlFY REPRESSOR, INVOLVED IN MANY CRlMES."
"This one here... the teacher, is my husband, Mario Portela."
We got married in 1976.
For me it was stupid having a white wedding because I wasn't a virgin.
But you know people.
Sometimes you must pretend to be what you are not.
"I had already made love with Mario for the first time on October 3, 1975."
It was beautiful.
Though I haven't got the photo.
And this thin kid here is Sebastian Garcia.
"When he was 16 years old, the ""Triple A"" kidnapped him."
"The ""Argentine Anticommunist Alliance""."
They said he was a subversive.
He went to a rally and they took his picture.
"The thing is when they tortured him, the poor kid, they wanted names and he didn't know what to say."
"So they used a cattle prod because he was silent, and he just said the first thing that came into his head."
"The names of his classmates, his teacher..."
I remember coming home that day.
"They'd broken the door down, they grabbed me, and I saw Mario with a hood over his head."
"Amanda, you don't have to tell me this, or hurt yourself."
"No, honey, you're wrong there."
This doesn't hurt.
It shouldn't hurt me.
What I...
You know what hurt most?
"Not the cattle prod, or being raped, or that son-of-a-bitch... flaying the soles off my feet with a razor blade..."
What hurt most was seeing Mario alive for the last time.
They brought him back after a session... two or three minutes...
"I remember he looked bad, and I thought I must look like that too."
Like looking in a mirror.
He could barely stand up.
His body was mangled.
It's fantastic every step of the way.
Dorm life is great.
"I love, love living here."
It's a great way to meet new people.
It's alot of fun.
You make so many new friends.
I have a big room.
That's nice.
Living in the dorms is probably where I've met the most diverse group of people.
"Here at U.R.I., we have this thing called the Living and Learning Community."
I lived in the Living Learning Community at Morrow.
"If you need help, you'd go to your neighbors."
"If you have some kind of random question, all you'd have to do is poke your head out the hallway and ask someone, which is so convenient."
Chances are somebody else will understand it.
The food's phenomenal I really like how we have a variety of food.
The grilled cheese.
I have never had onion rings like I have at home.
Well I'd definitely say that my favorite food in the stir fry.
The stir fry.
"They're crispy, the onions are soft."
I like to get the omelettes at Butterfield.
"On weekdays, there's omelettes."
All you can eat buffet.
"Its alot of variety, there's alot of options here on campus."
I like to put yogurt and granola and banana in a bowl and mix it up.
It's healthy if you're trying to eat healhty.
"Usually every Friday, it's nacho night."
"There's plenty of pizza and chicken nuggets, everything a college student needs."
I love the campus.
I fell in love with the campus.
A ton of nice people here.
"You can't help but smile, it's so nice here."
Motherfucker.
"Oh, hey."
"Just the same 12-year-old little boy-man-girl, except I'm not wearing a sports bra."
[MlMING HEAD EXPLODlNG]
You see?
"And a lot of people on the Internet can rant and rave about how much this guy's a fucking idiot, but I think you really need to go back in your mind, mostly guys, and think about all of the girls that you thought were really manly and gross and, like, athletic-looking, because they had their tits squished down."
Probably a little bit more than you'd like to admit.
Sun just went behind the clouds.
"So while you're watching the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of life, if you see a girl with some flat titties while she's working out or competing for a gold medal, it's not her titties."
It's her fucking bra!
"Sorry that you don't understand sports bras, because us girls have since the day we started growing fucking boobs."
"Right, Marbles?"
Where are your boobs?
In your shirt.
"Kermit, look at your ears, buddy."
You look like Princess Leia.
Yes you do.
Ohh!
"All right, make sure you subscribe to our channel."
We put out new videos every Wednesday!
And we hide our boobs sometimes when we work out so that they don't hit us in the face!
"Right, Kermit?"
"Yeah, you love boobs."
We'll see you next week.
Bye!
[DEEP VOlCE]
Bye —
[NORMAL VOlCE]
"Oh, there's the sun."
Fucking thanks for showing up.
Asshole.
Thank you all for coming tonight.
"July 24, 2010."
"It's nearly midnight now, and I'm running out of time to make this."
"I worked all day long, on a Saturday--yeah, I know."
The sad part is...
"I spent all day long hoping for something amazing to happen, something great, something to appreciate this day and to be a part of it and to... show the world that there's something great that can happen every day of your life, in everyone's life."
"But the truth is, it doesn't always happen."
"And for me, today... all day long, nothing really happened."
I want people to know that I'm here.
I don't want to cease to exist.
[thunder rumbling]
"I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I'm this great person, because..."
I don't think I am... at all.
"I think I'm a normal girl, normal life."
Not interesting enough... to know anything about.
But I want to be.
"And today... even though... even though nothing great really happened, tonight I feel as if something great happened."
[thunder rumbling]
[water dripping rhythmically]
man singing:
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach"
"When I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
"Just close your ears (don't listen), no other way."
What are they saying?- I didn't see any of them since the evening.
How am i to look in their faces?!..
"Don't be like this Mira, please!"
"It's all because of uncle Umit's stupidity,"
He did a very shameful thing.
"Whatever it is, was there the place to settle accounts."
Can one attack like savage in that way.
That was definitely barbaric...Inhuman...
"No one cares about what he did, dear Eylul."
Every body will talk about my father.
About our disgrace..- What disgrace ?
"This is business life, one can sing and get out..."
"Uncle Faruk was a good person when he earned money for them, when he lost it he became a bad one?"
Empty words!
Mom..
"Where?- To fix our reputation (honor), which is licking the dust."
Any news from dad?
"No, his phones are switched off."
I will have to find a solution on my own.
Good morning. &amp;gt; Good morning.
"Wow, my dad did the omelet, I knew it from the smell."
"Sit down, it will get cold.."
What is it? &amp;gt; Nothing.
There is something...
"Everybody is tensed because of what happened last night Mert, don't force it if you want."
If I get anything I will be Darth Vader
"Yaman, you have to take care of the official documents for the school.."
Birth and citizenship certificate and so on.
"Don't neglect it, Friday is the last day."
"Ok, I will prepare them someday."
"-This is important, get it done today!"
Get it off!
Get it off!
"Release him, demon."
"I command you in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ."
"Tell me your name, wicked one."
He who commands you is he who ordered you thrown down... ...from the highest heaven into the depths of hell.
"In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, I now command you:"
Tell me your name!
"Hear, therefore, and fear, Satan, enemy of the faith."
"Give me your name, demon!"
Names!
Names!
Ancient serpents... ...depart from this servant of God!
Tell me your six names!
We are the ones who dwell within!
And I am Lucifer... ...the devil in the flesh.
Mr. Rose.
"Doctor, help him!"
"*After a few moments,* *Mr. Rose revived... *"
*... but the exorcism* *had to be abandoned. *
Emily was taken to her room and soon fell into a deep sleep.
The whole thing was a complete failure.
Describe her behavior from the night of the failed exorcism... ...until the time of her death.
Violence towards others and herself.
Sometimes she screamed for hours on end.
"She drove her head through windows, tried to bite..."
"Tried to bite holes in the walls, breaking several more of her teeth... ...as you saw in the postmortem photograph."
- You witnessed this?
"- Some of it, yes."
I tried to visit every day... ...and the family told me the rest.
Did you attempt another exorcism?
"I wanted to, but Emily refused."
"And they gave them to 1,500 people."
It's in a book called Break Point and Beyond.
"And on the protocol of the test, if you scored  above a certain level, you'd be considered to be a genius at divergent thinking."
Okay?
"So, my question to you is, what percentage of the people tested, of the 1500, scored at genius level for divergent thinking?"
You need to know one more thing about them.
These were kindergarten children.
"So, what you think?"
What percentage at genius level?
(Audience member) 80.
"(Ken Robinson) You think 80, okay."
98%.
"Now, the thing about this was, it was a longitudinal study."
"So, they retested the same children five years later."
Age of eight to ten.
What do you think?
50?
"They retested them again, five years later,  ages 13 to 15."
"You can see a trend here, can't you"
[laughter]?
"Now, this tells an interesting story."
"Because you could have imagined it going the other way, couldn't you."
"You start off not being very good, but you get better  as you get older."
But this shows two things.
"One is, we all have this capacity."
"And two, it mostly deteriorates."
"Now, a lot of things have happened to these kids as they've grown up, a lot."
"But one of the most important things that happened to them,"
"I am convinced, is that by now, they've become educated."
"They know, they spent 10 years at school being told there's one answer."
It's at the back and don't look.
"And don't copy, because that's cheating."
"I start at the beginning of each list, and I say is one less than three?"
Sure.
So that says one should be the first element in my merge list.
"Now, compare the first element in each of these lists."
"Two is less than three, so two ought to be the next element of the list."
And you get the idea.
What am I going to do next?
I'm going to compare three against four.
"Three is the smallest one, and I'm going to compare four games twelve, which is going to give me four."
And then what do?
"I have to do twelve against thirty, twelve is smaller, take that out."
"Seventeen against thirty, twenty-four against thirty And by this stage I've got nothing left in this element, so I just add the rest of that list in."
"Wow I can sort two lists, so I can merge two lists."
I said it poorly.
What's the point?
How many operations did it take me to do this?
"Seven comparisons, right?"
I've got eight elements.
"It took me seven comparisons, because I can take advantage of the fact I know I only ever have to look at the first element of each sub-list."
"Those are the only things I need to compare, and when I run out of one list, I just add the rest of the list in."
What's the order of complexity of merging?
I heard it somewhere very quietly.
STUDENT: n.
PROFESSOR:
"Sorry, and thank you."
"Linear, absolutely right?"
And what's n by the way here?
What's it measuring?
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"In both lists, right."
I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
"So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size."
"Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green."
"I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so --"
I think we're OK.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"So, let's see,"
"let's take a different row of people, starting with you."
"I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four."
"Oh, I did this row already."
"Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five."
"Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead."
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Eight.
Three.
"57,683 -- squared."
Yuck.
Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
"I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two."
"Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer."
"Now, let me recap."
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Laughter)
While I explain something else -- (Laughter)
"-- I know, that you can use, right?"
(Laughter)
"While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation."
Let me explain what that is.
He is cautious of us as well.
We haven't been able to find his headquarters.
"After the ship has left, we will send our men as we agreed."
Please do not concern yourself any longer about that ship.
You mean there is no evidence of any trade of weapons by Yongmun?
Yes.
They have amassed great wealth by trading with China.
But they have never traded in weapons.
Alright.
But there was a small commotion involving Yongmun.
"Although they weren't directly involved, someone filed a report against the loan shark Choi Chul Joo, who borrowed a warehouse from Yongmun."
Choi Chul Joo?
What kind of man is he?
He is a loan shark rumored to have a past as a bandit.
So Yongmun has business arrangements with such a man?
It's Yongmun.
It looks like a funeral procession.
Let's stand aside and let them pass.
"The dead girl is said to have died while running away from Choi Chul Joo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Oh, how terrible!"
How terrible!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
They... they are one with the men that killed our daughter!
They're one with them!
- What do I do now?
- Compose yourself!
Move along!
- No!
- Will you kill my son too!
You evil men!
Sheath your swords!
Let's go!
- You evil wretches!
- Are you alright?
side.
I just cooked it up by adding this one to this one.
"Now, what's the solution with this new right-hand side?"
The solution with this new right-hand side is clear.
took one of these and none of those.
"So actually, it just changed around"
to this when I took this new right-hand side.
Okay.
"So in the row picture, I have three different planes,"
three new planes meeting now at this point.
"In the column picture,"
"I have the same three columns, but now I'm combining them"
"to produce this guy, and it turned out that column one"
plus column two which would be somewhere -- there is the right
column -- one of this and one of this would give me the new b.
Okay.
So we squeezed in an extra example.
"But now think about all bs,"
all right-hand sides.
Can I solve these equations for
every right-hand side?
Can I ask that question?
So that's the algebra question.
Can I solve A x=b for every b?
Let
me write that down.
Can I solve A x =b for every
right-hand side b?
"I mean, is there a solution?"
"And then, if there is, elimination will give me a way to find it."
"I really wanted to ask, is there a solution for every right-hand side?"
"So now, can I put that in different words -- in this linear"
That giving mukti.
"Up to namabhas, up to mukti, it may be."
Or may not.
That name.
[or??] namakar.
That [of??] the seed without the potency within it.
Imitation is like that.
Without the seed.
"The medicine is there, apparently."
But the potency of the medicine is [absent?].
It will be like that.
At most that name produce what is namabhasa.
One thing: proper...
Name proper.
Name means it is not material.
It is not under the jurisdiction of the concocted area.
Misunderstood area.
It must not have root there.
In the [paws?] of imitation.
The root must not be there.
"The root, name proper, must have to become, have it's connection with the infinite proper."
One thing.
"And the next thing: it must be treated properly, that is sevon-mukh, serving attitude."
"Not exploiting mood, not indifferent mood."
"Serving attitude must be there and the seed must be proper seed, bonafide."
Two things necessary.
Everywhere.
"Sadhu-sanga, that is also bonafide."
We are to differentiate it from the sham.
From the apparent.
That is from mayic conception.
Which is not so.
"But It, itself,  is not an appearance."
Hm?
What are we speaking about?
You!
"It's not  some abstract principle, somewhere behind here; that's also an idea."
"And when you  keep on looking and seeing that everything that has form depends upon a formless seer  of them, somehow."
"All of them report back, as far back as the attention can follow."
It evolves into emptiness.
Everything is coming back  to emptiness.
You have to prove this  for yourself.
This is why  I don't say it's a teaching; it's pointing.
Look.
"Ultimately, can what we are be a phenomenon?"
And a phenomenon  cannot witness itself.
"We say the ego  is aware of itself, but what's aware of that?"
So that awareness somehow comes into emptiness again.
And it is  the experience of this that brings clarity  and peace to the mind.
'What does the third eye see?'
"First, the second eye  and the first eye, then they are seeing  only things."
"And the third eye  is seeing what, also?"
"They call 'eye of intuition,' what is that one seeing?"
Hm?
[Music plays in the background]
[M:]
"Its light  is understanding, that is the light  of the third eye: intuitive understanding."
"But what sees third eye, also?"
Can the Seer of the third eye  be seen?
And by whom?
"All these questions,  they can be solved here."
Okay.
[M:]
Okay. www.mooji.org
But are the points in the number line still there?
"Yes, they are embedded in Q, right?"
"So, you might wanna say how Z is embedded in Q. Ok?"
"So, we want these pairs to extend Z so that..."
"Ok, which classes will correspond to Z... to the elements of the natural numbers?"
"What will I... if I... give me the number five, what class would you hope that it somehow associated with?"
"Yeah, how about five over one, so that, for instance, n over one in Q corresponds to n in Z."
So this is the other thing that we might hope for in our construction.
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, if you've taken an Algebra course, then what we are looking for is an isomorphism of a..."
Z into Q.
"But, if you don't know these words yet, that's ok."
"Ok, so tell me what the equivalence relation should be."
"So, after grade school, or after enough examples, we see that, what?"
"Q is the set of all, let's say, m over n..."
"Here's a def... here's a... these are equivalence classes... such that m, n are in Z, n is not zero, where m over n is an equivalence class of a... is the equivalence class of m coma n with the relation..."
What relation?
"Ok, tell me when p... two things, two ordered pairs are equivalent."
When will p coma q be equivalent to m coma n?
Steve.
[Student speaking].
Good!
This is otherwise known as the... what are some name...
You cross multiply to check whether fractions are the same...
Yes that's the equivalence relation...
So with this relation these are equivalent if... if what conditions are true?
Steve suggested doing what?
"Let's take p times n, and check whether it's the same as what? q times n."
And what else?
Let's just demand that n and q not be zero.
Ok?
So
I think kids are going to push my buttons.
"And that's the thing that scares me the most about going back to school, just the other kids."
"After three short months, Adam is starting again at Boston High."
His brief success in the jail classroom is a stark contrast to what he is about to face.
It's like asking a baby to read.
And I said it was like to trying to make gold out of straw like Rumpelstiltskin.
And mom said it was like trying to make silk purse out of--
Adam is still well below grade level and Doctor Andrea Weiss worries that there is nothing in place to help him.
"When I went back to test him, he hadn't made any progress."
But he shouldn't have.
There was no way for him to make progress because he needs specialized instruction.
He's not going to get it by osmosis.
"He's not going to stand in a room and it's going to, you know, kind of go through his pores."
It's not going to happen.
"He needs somebody to say, look, this is the way to do it."
This is the structure.
This is the recipe.
It works every time.
And then he'll own it.
What's that called?
Food chain.
Exactly.
Food chain.
Adam has been placed in two Special Ed classes.
"But the kids here have such a wide variety of learning problems, that, ironically, Adam appears to be doing better than he really is."
An element in all organisms is--
Carbon.
"Carbon, exactly."
"Academically, he's probably at the top of my classes."
"I have the whole gammut, you know."
"I have real low level, acting out kids."
-I've never driven one of these
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-get back in you cage!
-I'm gonna change your grade kiddo
"-Justin,that's not even funny -asshole"
Subtitles By Lynna Nguyen
My name is Autumn Moon.
I quit school after junior high.
I was no good in my study.
But the education system was no better.
It not only excludes me from further study... ...but produces juveniles like me.
"I've got nothing to do but hang around public playgrounds... ...playing basketball, talking part in brawls... being recruited as or recruiting triad members."
Stop!
No way!
Can I have a shoot?
This half-witted jerk is Sylvester.
I never found out his last name.
But I'm sure he's no Stallone.
"I ""recruited"" him from the street."
He was being bullied by a group of students and I came to help him.
"Well, at least he was smart enough now... ...that I could provide protection for him."
"That's how he became my ""junior""."
One brags about being a Big Brother. ...but one doesn't boast oneself of having a retard like sylvester as junior.
If anyone of you will never bully him again... ...I'll make sure you pay for it.
"Well, you may think I'm worth nothing because"
I'm jobless and hang around all day... ...but that's not exactly true.
My job is to help Big Brother Wing collect debts.
"I'm lone wolf type of person, doing whatever I like to do."
"To me, freedom counts first."
I'm not like the rest of them because I have brains.
I don't take orders.
And she's ferried a couple airplanes.
From North Carolina to Oklahoma.
Stuff like that.
Just little pick up...
You can see her picture up there.
That's her with her uniform on and that's her next to it with the...
"Oh, yes I can see that."
130-something pounds and...
She likes it.
"She says, ""I go to work for my hobby."""
Runs in the family then.
Came right down from you
When did you meet De then and where?
In Grand Rapids.
A flight to Chicago.
I was doing some commercial bill collecting.
And they had some kind of convention went went to around St. Patrick's Day.
So the boss flew down.
There was a big headquarters where the western... area...
That was - I forget the initials now.
It was like a commercial version of...
We did credit reports on places.
They'd have a group - say all the plumbing and suppliers would meet once a month and they'd discuss and you'd keep building habits.
We had a part of our outfit would
liquidate - if a place would go bankrupt
We'd send our crew in to get them out of bankruptcy.
"I remember one guy, we made him sell his airplane"
His twin-engine airplane.
He had a hot secretary.
"He got rid of the secretary, got rid of the airplane and he lived in east Grand Rapids."
Gave him so much money for groceries and that was it.
With the stipulation he couldn't even go to the building for a year.
"Emily Rose's condition, in fact, was demonic possession."
An exorcism was her only hope for a cure.
Some of you may find yourself unable to reconcile Emily's beliefs... ...or those of the defendant with your own.
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.
"Because you will see that after the utter failure of doctors to help Emily... ...Father Moore simply tried to help Emily in a different way... ...using an approach that he, Emily and her family firmly believed... ...was her only chance for relief."
And we will show that despite his greatest efforts... ...and his sincere love for Emily... *... there was nothing he could've done* *to prevent the death of Emily Rose. *
Are you okay?
Aren't you gonna eat anything?
*She said it was terrible to hear* *the clinking of spoons and forks. *
"She was always hungry, but she said they wouldn't let her eat."
"Who did she mean by ""they""?"
The forces that were in control of her.
That were inside her.
"You know, the demons."
Tell us what else happened that night.
I walked her back to her dorm... ...and she seemed really nervous and scared.
"*So I held her for a while,* *trying to calm her down. *"
"*I fell asleep, but when I woke up,* *she wasn't beside me. *"
Emily?
Hey.
Can you hear me?
"*I called her father, and he told me* *to bring Emily home. *"
*Jason and I put Emily to bed... *
*... hoping she would sleep. *
And when did Father Moore become involved?
Emily stayed home after that.
"She didn't return to school, and she kept getting worse."
"Eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore."
"When he arrived, I sent my daughter Alice upstairs..."
*... to see if Emily was awake. *
Emily?
Vandana....
Come.
Do you remember I had told you that... ... a day would come when your son would call you mother?
Come.
"Perhaps you haven't recognised her, sir."
Do you recollect that she had come with Arun for your birthday party?
"Yes, I have recognised her."
But I don't understand how...
Before marrying according to custom he...
And that is why she was unable to accept her son until today.
She bore her troubles alone... ... so that I could become a pilot in the Indian Air Force.
Because she had made a promise to my father.
There are some things that are greater than the limits of society.
You are one of them.
And I think that you should give your son his medal.
I?
A woman who despite losing her husband in an air crash... ... has the courage to make her only son a pilot.
I believe that her son should receive the medal from her.
"Vandana, your years of penance has borne fruit."
Take this.
Mother!
My son!
Today I can hold my head up with pride and say... ... that I do not know how much penance I must have done... ... in order to become the son of a great mother like you.
Your devotion will bear fruit
Do not weep...
Hello!
"Let's take a look at Chapter 6, Consumer Purchasing Strategies and Wise Buying of Motor Vehicles."
"Um, when should you buy?"
And when should you not buy?
"One of the first things I want you to consider when looking at this chapter, when is it better to have the cash and when is it better to go ahead and buy the item now?"
The first thing you need to look at is what is the difference in the cost?
Okay?
The people will find his name on the updated witness list... ...we provided to them this morning.
Very well.
I'll allow it into evidence.
Father Moore.
Will you play the tape for us now?
*This is the exorcism of Emily Rose. *
"*Those present are myself,* *Father Richard Moore... * ...Nathaniel, Emily's father... ...Jason, her friend... ...a doctor who is here to monitor Emily during the ritual... ...and Emily herself... ...who has given her permission for the ritual to be performed."
"All right, now listen."
You may say the rosary or any private prayer for her deliverance... ...when you're not responding to my words.
"Above all... ...do whatever I ask, without question."
Don't ask it any questions... ...or pay any attention to what it says.
"""It""?"
We won't be dealing with Emily tonight.
Restrain her.
"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us."
It has begun.
Let us pray.
"""Because she hopes in you, my God."""
"""Send her help from the holy place, Lord."""
"""And give her heavenly protection."""
"""May the Lord be with you."""
"""And with your spirit."""
"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
My God.
Are you all right?
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
I'm fine.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation...
But deliver us from evil!
"Who are you, demon?"
Bay and the beach with the map and if we'd find something we'd just mark it.
"Because they're trying to get a drift pattern to the bodies, or survivors."
Then we'd come back and drop it off
But all those guys - the bodies that came in were all in the fetal position
And two guys survived.
One guy lived between
Charlevoix and [?].
Dad knew him quite well.
He said they started off with more than that on the raft a floating type thing.
"But it was so bad a night - just a nasty night, as you can imagine."
And the water felt warm to them.
Which it would
The water was 35 degrees and the air was 15 with sleet.
"They said, ""I'm just going to get in here and get warm."""
And they drifted away.
Two of them did hang on.
"Survived, out of the -"
But we could hear when they were breaking out -
"You listen at night, to the transitions on the channels."
Can you hear the radio of The Bradley before they went down?
Uh-huh.
Radioed in.
"It's breaking away, or bending away or"
"And when you flew out with - who was the pilot, again, that you flew out with?"
Don Hanson
"When you flew out, the goal of that flight was what?"
Flew all of the islands.
All around the shores of all the islands.
To look for survivors?
For survivors or anything that would be anything.
"And I was 16, 17 at the time."
Did you know at that time where the location of where The Bradley was?
"In 2002, she starts conversing online with a man named Jim Price."
"They meet, fall in love, and marry."
"He just got me right from the very beginning, and we laughed all the time, and he just was my best friend."
"When she was and Jim were together, it seemed like that was gone."
That didn't matter.
All the baggage of the memories that she had were what kind of put away.
"For a few years, she had doctors to help her, a husband's who adored her."
"Then two years after the marriage, tragedy."
"Jim, a diabetic, died of a stroke at the age of 42, another day relive in full pain over and over again."
And we could say time heals all wounds.
It doesn't for her.
"Her best friend, Wendy LaVoy."
"I think Jill's brave, and I think she has a lot of courage."
And she's my hero because of it.
I don't think she knows that.
She will.
"Before we go, she brings something for me-- an article from almost 40 years ago."
I was in my 20s.
I have no memory at all of this.
"Oh, my gosh."
I think you were working at the White House.
"Oh, good grief."
I was working at the White House.
"In her book The Woman Who Can't Forget, she says she's trying to learn to live forward."
"Inspired by her husband, learning to laugh at her difficult gift."
"What's so great about Jill is Jill will call me on any given day and she'll say, Wendy, do you remember what we did 20 years ago today?"
"I'm like, you're kidding, Jill."
I don't remember what I had for lunch today.
Little cerebellum--
"At the same time, the doctors hope she'll help unlock the secrets of Alzheimer's, of genius, and the way all of us remember."
"I don't want to go too crazy here, but it could-- revolutionize is maybe too big of a word-- it could profoundly influence how we think the brain stores memories."
All right.
Turn in a circle and clap!
Yay!

"this poem is called ""the lovers"" who see them going in the city if everyone is blind."
They take eachother by the hand.
Something speaks inbetween theire fingers
"In this video, we're going to look at a proof that the perceptron learning procedure will eventually get the weights into the cone of feasible solutions."
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about the course from this video.
"In general, it's going to be about engineering, not about proofs of things."
There'll be very few proofs in the course.
But we get to understand quite a lot more about perceptrons when we try and prove that they will eventually get the right answer.
So we get to use our geometric understanding of what's happening in weight space as to get a proof that the perceptron will eventually find a weight vector.
Okay.
There are forces surrounding this trial.
"Dark, powerful forces."
"Just be careful, Erin."
Watch your step.
I see.
Look...
"Father, you don't have to worry about me."
"I'm an agnostic, remember?"
"Demons exist, whether you believe in them or not."
Your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
"Look, Father, I appreciate your concern... ...but you need to be worried about yourself."
"Ethan Thomas is using the medical aspects of this case as ammunition... ...and I have to be prepared for his attacks, so... ...with what little time we have, I think we need to focus on your defense."
"Now, what I need from you is more information about Emily's condition."
Specific details of how it progressed after the dorm-room episode.
"Well, after the first incident... ...she was sent to the university hospital for testing and observation."
"Emily once told me that in her dorm room, she resisted the demons... ...but at the hospital they overcame her."
So she believed... ...that her possession began at the hospital?
"Yeah, I think she did."
"And after that, things just went from bad to worse."
Emily!
Emily?
"Oh, my God."
Emily?
Don't touch me.
"Jason, please... ...don't leave me."
*And I never did leave her. *
*I stayed until the end. *
So much of what we shared was like a nightmare... ...but I wouldn't give up a single minute I spent with her.
"She woke me up, you know?"
"To things I never felt before, things I never knew I could feel."
I never knew how dead I was until I met her.
"look, pray for us.."
You too pray for me go don't worry come on woman.. where is your drum? oh shit I forgot it.. never mind she brought it thank you Balçiçek.. how do you take this microphone out?
Ok.. go now are you ready?
"1,2,3000 hello dear guests.. welcome all..."
Tonight we will have a lot of fun.. me and my aunt oh I mean me and Mrs Kadriye will entertain you tonight although we are new to show bizz
Tonight we will dance and sing.. oh aunt kadriye stop thumping that drum..
I cannot hear myself talk..
I will give you time to play solo at the end of the program..
Why are you laughing?
She was always like this even when we were kids.. she didn't play the drum then but she used to hold it and hit our heads with it she's a real witch.. she is..
let's hear the drum aunt Kadriye..
"""Hoppa"""
Oh Great!
Why are you laughing?
Hey blondie why are you laughing???
You!! how can you laught with only 1 tooth in your mouth.. yeah you!.. they laugh a lot at everything..
Are you ready? we're ready
Ok let's start
We will start with a song
It was a wonderful concert.. thank you so this means you forgot last night
At one moment I began daydreaming and forgot everything
Who am I.. and where am I.. and what is this place
I just went with them and started daydreaming
Excuse me.
"I had to speak politely as the last time don't worry, be at ease.. it suits you more"
Aunt Kadriye it seems we have succeeded
I'll close my store and go on with show bizz from now on you're right
Get up girl and dance.. such a fool it seem they perfected the job
I hope they finish before they face any problems
God willing
"The food was extremely delicious when it comes to cooking, Nakiye is excellent"
Shewket what do you do?
Thank you so much for your concern.
"It seems like you're doing some secret work, but I hope you're safe too."
"He was a bit strange, but he was a good man."
How can you tell?
"I'm not sure, but he smelled really nice."
"If you thought he smelled nice, then he must have eaten chicken or dumplings."
It wasn't like that!
It was a nicer smell than dumplings!
"It smelled like ""I love you""!"
Then maybe he ate both chicken and dumplings!
"Anyway, I feel like I met a really nice person today."
So you met a mysterious man in a black hat under the moonlight...?
Then maybe his name is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
Sir Moonlight Back Hat?
That's awesome!
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
So you're saying that ship and warehouse both belong to Yongmun?
Yes.
I'm sure they moved all the girls to the ship by now.
"If they both belong to Yongmun, then did they just loan them to the loan sharks?"
"If they loaned it out to a dirty man, then they must have had dirty business."
What should we do if Yongmun responds?
"If Yongmun comes forward, then we should too."
We may have a fight on our hands.
But...
I don't think they will.
That is the explosives manufactured by Choi Chul Joo.
They are more powerful than the explosives from China.
"If this deal with him succeeds, then will we have unlimited access to these explosives?"
Yes.
"If we add the power of those explosives to our army and weapons, we will not be lacking in the next attempt."
Is there a way we can obtain those explosives without Choi Chul Joo?
"Since you bought me this washbasin, I'll pay for our meal."
"Go ahead and eat it, Young Master."
I bought one for you too.
Come and eat.
I'll wait outside for you.
I guess I have to eat this then.
Have you stopped going to the government offices and filing reports?
I stopped it because it was useless.
Then do you think stopping Choi Chul Joo's ship will be useful?
You can never tell a lie.
"Young Master, are you... ...going to stop them?"
They can't regain their daughters by stopping the ship.
The parents are doing something foolish because of their own guilt.
They're trying to protect their daughters!
Protect?
They were the ones that sold their daughters off.
"Choi Chul Joo took them, but their parents were the ones that sold them."
They do not know how to protect.
"It's not that they don't know how, it's just that they're powerless."
"I know, because I lost someone too."
I was too powerless to protect that person.
I couldn't go with that person either.
Do you know how painful that is?
You can say that because you're powerful and you've never lost anyone like that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
"When I was young and imprisoned in the Queen's palace with my mother,"
I was fearful that I would lose her.
"I pretended to be calm and comforted my mother, ... but I knew."
I knew that I wouldn't be able to protect her in the end.
"I knew I would lose her, because I was too young and powerless."
I was desperate to protect her.
But now...
"And now, a rockabilly guitar."
Which is nice.
"But what if I want to make, say, a -- (Applause) --"
Thanks.
"What if I want to make, say, a rock organ?"
Is that possible?
"Yes, it is, by recording myself like this."
(Organ sound)
"And now I have that, I have that recorded."
Assign it to a keyboard.
(Music)
So that's cool.
(Applause)
But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
"Impossible, you say."
No.
"It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine."
It's really fantastic.
Check it out.
(Music)
So every noise you can hear there is my voice.
I didn't just trigger something which sounds like that.
There's no samples.
There's no synthesizers.
"That is literally all my voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you, what's the point?"
Why do this?
(Laughter)
"Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd,"
"I suppose, is the easy answer."
"But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already exist."
I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine.
"So with your permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them, because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see."
I'll be leaving as soon as he gets better.
It might be a burden to you and the young prince if I stay in the palace.
What burden?
His Majesty is very happy to see you.
I took away too much time as you already have a weary heart.
His body was blue all over...this mean that  there must be someone who's harming him purposely.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
"If there is a problem with the food, we need  to investigate the royal chef and find out the truth."
That's right.
We should...
You are wrong.
It won't be too late to investigate  after His Majesty gains back some energy.
What are you talking about?
We need to find out  the truth in order to prescribe the right treatment to him.
"Your Highness, he is extremely ill so please come back at a later time."
What do you mean?
I'm his mother.
Move a side.
Your Highness!
What's your intention for preventing me from seeing him?
I need to see his condition with my own eyes.
Please tell the Queen Mother that His Majesty  is not in a condition to see her right now.
Are you saying that I am harming him now?
- A patriot.

Gary's Mattresses are probably filled and stuffed with dead minorities.
-We're stalking prices!
"-All right, so this video's old."
It's been floating around the Internet for about two years.
It's got about 2 million views and I don't know if it's real or not.
"I mean, look at that."
Terrorist Gary?
"""I'm a suicide bomber and I'm so offended."""
"But see, the address they give for the store doesn't check out on Google Maps."
"Also, the guy in it looks like a stand-up comedian that I've seen on TV."
Which makes me think the video is fake.
It also obvious seems a little too f--ked to have appeared on TV.
"-If you find a mattress at a better price,"
I'll kick a puppy and punch a kitten just for you!
"-All right, I've made up my mind."
That is definitely not real.

"That's it, I'm out."
I'm gonna go have a beer.

Let's change it up.

"So, leave your interesting or creative responses in the comments section below or on Twitter or Facebook."
But thanks for watching today's episode of =3.
I'm Ray William Johnson and I approve this message.
"So tell me forum, why are you here?"
Uht-oh.
That brought us to seventy.
We want to show fifty two.
What happened was we weren't paying attention to the scale or the units.
The value between each of our numbers is ten because this number line counts by tens.
What we really want is two jumps of one and that will bring us to fifty two.
Be very careful to pay attention to the unit marks on the number lines.
Let's model forty five on a number line.
As we see these numbers come up we're watching our scale and see it counts by ones.
"It starts with thirty five, goes to thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight, and so on."
We have four tens in forty five.
We can start at forty.
"Five ones, we can do one jump of five."
Forty to forty five.
If we model eighty nine on the number line
"-again let's look at our scale- eighty, eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, and so on."
I see this is counting by ones again.
Eight tens is eighty.
"And, we have nine ones."
We could handle this in a couple of different ways.
Let's think about doing what we did last time.
A jump of five; eighty to eighty five.
"Then we need to do one, two, three, four more jumps of one and we're at eighty nine."
Let's try a three-digit number.
One hundred thirty two.
"Ninety, ninety five, one hundred, one hundred five."
Our number line counts by fives  so we need to think about that as we're working.
"We have one hundred, three tens, so let's jump three tens."
"I have to do five and five is ten, twenty, thirty (three tens) and two ones."
"One, two, and that brings us to one hundred thirty two."
Let's model two hundred fifty three on a number line.
"Two hundred, two hundred ten,  two hundred twenty, two hundred thirty."
And then I jump up and say:
"""I won this award last year, but didn't say the most important thing."""
It should look like I just grabbed a mike.
"Then I say that... ...some people are glad that child- ren die, it saves the environment."
Others fall on their knees and say someone has to save the children.
"Some pray to a higher power, but most feel powerless and stare off into space."
They think only crazy optimists like Rosling think it's getting better.
In school we did a lot of variety shows.
I had good directors but they said that I couldn't act.
"""You're always yourself."
"You can't take direction and you can't act."""
So I became a stage manager.

"-Yes, but the criticism was right."
I have semi-controlled ADHD.
I can communicate and lecture but playing another person takes a different kind of skill.
You have to tape it well on my cheek.

- Can't you make it bigger?
- We can run it in widescreen.
The total projection was bigger a minute ago.
- We can stretch it sideways.
- Make it as big as possible.
- It's not even half the ceiling.
- That's because of the lens.
"Sure, but for the maximum effect it needs to be as big as possible."
Try widescreen.
"See that, Karin?"
"They said it worked, but it doesn't."
We're not using the whole ceiling.
You lose 90% of the effect.

Manish has developed ill intentions.
He wants to keep the 100 million worth of diamonds to himself.
Manish has turned a betrayer who we cannot trust anymore.
"I don't want Manish now, but those diamonds."
Go and search every corner of the city.
Beat him!
I don't want to hear anything.
If I don't get those diamonds. . .
I will bury you half in soil and blow up the other half with a bomb.
I want those diamonds worth 100 million.
Go and find Manish anyhow.
Is Lily home?
"- No, she has gone to Goa."
My name is Manish.
Ask her to call me when she returns.
"Look, don't forget, it is very urgent."
"Do make her call me, okay?"
And he's in the seventh grade.
"So what happened to the fourth grade, the fifth grade, and the sixth grade?"
"I mean, something's wrong."
"At that point, I did think I was dumb."
"I was stupid, like, why can't I read?"
"All my friends go to Latin, Boston Latin, one of the best schools-- probably the best school in Massachusetts, like, an exam school."
They read fine.
Why can't I read?
Adam was too old for the early intervention remedies and the school's solution to help Adam sounded better on paper that it was in reality.
They said Adam needs a small classroom setting.
And where did they send him?
It's like going into prison.
"He's down in the cellar, in a little room about this size with 12 other kids."
"So instead of working on ways to make it in school, Adam started working on ways to get out of school."
I went to the school and went room to room to room to his teachers.
Some of his teachers had never seen Adam.
And this is two months into the school year-- had never seen him.
"You take school out of that age, you take it away, you take it out of the picture, what else is there?"
"There's marijuana, there's stealing cars."
"I mean, what else is there for a kid?"
So you run the streets.
"And you run the streets, you get in trouble."
You make bad choices.
Adam was so-- he was mad.
He can't read.
Adam's parents knew it was time for professional help.
At the Boston Medical
"Center, Doctor Andrea Weiss, a clinical psychologist, gave Adam a new battery of tests."
What we're going to do first is I'm going to give you some reading lists.
And what I'd like you to do is just read down the list out loud.
And if you come to words you don't know--
Doctor Weiss's tests provide a kind of road map to when Adam's learning skills hit the wall.
There's the cars we're driving and the water waste.
And all the trash we don't care where we're throwing it.
That's what I think.
"Cars, buses."
"It's industry, its gasoline, it's energy use."
All the fumes from cars.
Cars.
Too many vehicles maybe.
The fumes in the air.
All the gas.
And people driving in the city.
"Cars, factories, planes."
I image the aviation industry hasn't helped.
I mean one air plane can fly across country and its like 40 tonnes of carbon.
"40 tonnes, that's a lot."
I think in one word I would say pollution.
"Coal power stations, gas power stations."
People using more energy than they need to.
We are wasting a lot ...
An excessive use of gasses.
"And also coal burning stations, especially in China."
"All the pollutants that we pump into the air, day after day."
"Everyone says the same thing: it's the cars, the planes, the industrial plants."
It's because we leave our lights on and take long showers.
Always the same familiar answers.
"And yes: of course it's true, but no-one has yet won the grand prize."
Because we're forgetting one extremely important factor.
Eighteen percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by livestock farming.
That might surprise you.
"Farmed animals, 18%!"
And guess what percentage of total global emissions are caused by transport?
Thirteen percent!
It's obvious you're doing well.
It looks good on you!
"Come on, enjoy your meal...- hey. dude..."

Did you really give rein for 500000 USD to Faruk?
I gave it from my personal account.
Only fools do unrequited favors.
"I didn't grant that money to Faruk, dad!"
"Cut it out, for God's sake!"
I was married four times... and I didn't give reins to so much money for anyone.
I didn't lend anyone money without getting the return until today!
Neither in my personal life nor in my business life.
"Because I know that everything which belongs to me, belongs to you, to your brother, to my grandchildren and to this holding at the same time."
I don't ever forget this either.-But you don't behave like that
You take steps which you can't take them back.
"Dad, please!"
"Really, I don't have energy to discuss with you."
I have been running here and there all day.
Please could you let me unbrace myself a bit...
Don't test my patience Ender!

"Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just did his little procedure on is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped."
"He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking."
"And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second."
"And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time."
(Laughter)
"And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ... (Laughter)"
"Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up."
Albert hands me the knife.
"I go in, tail comes off."
"I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off."
"Albert instructs, ""Push it way up there."""
I do.
"""Push it further."""
I do.
"The testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs, coming right at you -- and he says, ""Bite 'em."
"Just bite 'em off."""

How did -- you know -- I mean -- how did I get here?

"It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on it's own: and suddenly, I'm standing there, in the Rockies, and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy."
"You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity."
(Laughter)
"And I'm like, ""What is this jacked-up metaphor?"
"I don't like what I'm thinking right now."""
"And I can't get this thought out of my head, and I can't get that vision out of my sight, so I did what I had to do."
I went in and I took them.
"I took them like this, and I yanked my face back."
And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.
(Laughter)
So let me write 12th down.
She's the 12th tallest and shortest.
"If everyone in the class is a different height, how many students are there in the class?"
And these are the type of questions that I just like to make sure that I'm not miscounting.
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?
That means that there are 11 people taller than her.
So let's say from shortest to tallest.
So this is Stacy right here.
"And so, if she is the 12th tallest-- let me put it this way."
"If I said that she was the first tallest, that means there's no one taller than her."
"If she's the second tallest, that means there's one person taller than her."
"If she's the third tallest, that means there's two people taller than her."
"And likewise, if she's the 12th tallest, that means that there are 11 people taller."
"Similarly, if she's the 12th shortest, well, that must mean that there are 11 shorter than her."
So this is really just making sure that you parse the words correctly and count properly.
"So if there's 11 shorter, 11 taller, and then there's"
"Stacy, well, that's 22 plus her."
There's 23 students in the class.
"And this is just to make sure that you don't say, oh, 12 taller, 12 shorter, and say 25 or something like that."
"It's just to confuse you really, I think."

"The quadratic function g is given by-- this is just the general way people write quadratic functions-- is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c, where a and c are negative constants."
Which of the following could be the graph of g?
So I'm not going to even look at the choices.
"I'll just show you how I would-- if someone didn't even give me any choices, and say, well, if a and c are less than 0, what's this going to look like?"
So let's draw the x and y.
If the mean beak width does significantly increase or decrease in size.
This is referred to as Directional Selection.
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with bigger beak widths.
Let's say we know that the average beak width of all finches is 6.07 millimeters.
This includes finches that have been studied over the last few years.
But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from today.
"We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in size?"
"That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches today is equal to what they have been."
And what should the alternative hypothesis be?
"That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to 6.07."

The New West is on strike until the King agrees.
We're in the right.

They insist the King punish Prince Yuning.
What will you do?
Geum.

We'll have him banished for this.
He won't threaten your crown again.
I'll see to that.
We're leaving.

The New West is applying pressure.
If they keep this up the King will have to accede.

"My dad can go to bankruptcy, we can go down to Zero... we will rearrange our life according to that."
"What are those mom, what are those, what?"
"You mean the real, true happiness is this, those things?"
"My sweetheart, are we not a family?"
How fast have you given up ?
"You will see,"
That man will be ashamed for what he did...
And also for attacking my dad in front of everyone ..
He will apologize to dad in front of everyone...
"I am saying it again, I trust my dad."
We have to support him.
After all this I don't even care what people say.
And i know my father is not a thief.
I know that he never wanted to do something bad.
We will pull ourselves together.
"You also pull yourself together, please.."
Are you alright?
I am worried about you.

"And that Orkuc is an orkuc (blurt out) really. he wanders around with Hale, but I can't believe what Eylul did, how can one abandon the friend and go to them?"
"Instead of consoling Mira, both of them ran away..."
"I thought that ""plastic"" was next to Mira, he also went to Hale?"
"It looks like your receiver broke down, I am telling you since one hour."
"I am saying I saw him, I am saying she was in the car, I am saying he was with Hale."
"She needed moral support, by finding and putting her head on a pillow like this..."
"Okay, don't brisk up (simulate),i got it."
"I can understand all of them, but never Eylul."
"I will take one too, my head is exploding too."
"This night after talking to you, i did not get a wink of sleep."

Who knows what they are talking about us?
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And we'll count about 50 to 100 of them, and we'll place them in a glass tube..."
And then we add some hexane.
And then we grind it up.
"And what you can see is the white part here at the bottom is the pulp of the seed, and that's where the oil is."
And what that oil will do is actually migrate up into the extraction layer here.
"And then will suck that little clear part off, and place it into a GC vile."
"Now once the liquid in in here, we have a computer that can control this robot"
And it applies a sample on every 24 minutes.
"Because this is automated, we can run anywhere from 900 to 1,000 samples within a week, and runs 24 hours a day."
Beth Seaton:
"Why would you run 900 to 1,000 samples?"
Win Phippen:
"Well, if you're breeding plants, you're not quite sure which one has the components that you want."
"So when I make a cross, I've got all the these young seedling plants, and I'm not sure which one I'm interested in."
So I have to collect seeds from each individual plant.
Beth Seaton:
Every single plant?
Win Phippen:
Every single plant.
Beth Seaton:
And that's why you keep these numbers running?
Win Phippen:
And I've got to keep every single vile together.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Once we have the sample in the vile, there's a robot here that is controlled by the computer, that will inject a sample very 24 minutes."
"So, as soon as the sample goes in, it actually enters into a very long glass tube."
It's about 30 meters long.
And so if it's a very
And then we're going to multiply that times y plus 2.
"So when you multiply y plus 2 times this, so you have y times negative y squared, it gets us negative y to the third power. y times 3y is going to be plus 3y squared."
2 times negative y squared is negative 2y squared.
And then 2 times 3y is plus 6y.
So then you go all the way down here.
"This thing can simplify, too, because you have 3y squared minus 2y squared."
So this going to be negative y to the third plus-- this part right over here simplifies to just y squared-- y squared plus 6y.
So that's this entire part simplified to this down here.
We can take the 2 pi out of the integral sign.
So let's do that.
We're integrating from y is equal to 0 to y is equal to 3 dy.
"And I took the 2 pi out here, and that is equal to our volume."
"And so now, we're essentially ready to take the antiderivative."
This is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of this business evaluated at 3 minus evaluated at 0.
And I'll color code it.
I found this useful.
"The antiderivative of y to the third is y to the fourth over 4, so this is negative y to the fourth over 4."
"Antiderivative of y squared is y to the third over 2-- or y to the third over 3, I should say."
"And then finally, I'll do it in yellow."
"Antiderivative of 6y is 3y squared, so plus 3y squared."
And we are going to evaluate all of this business at 0 and 3.
So this simplifies.
"This going to be equal to 2 pi times-- well, let's see."
Let me do it in the same colors.
3 to the fourth power is 81.
"So it's negative 81 over 4, plus-- 3 to the third is 27 divided by 3 is 9, plus 9."
"And then 3 squared is 9 times 3 is 27, plus 27."
"And then when you evaluate all of these things at 0, you just get 0."
"So you're just subtracting out 0, so we really don't have to do anything else with the 0."
And now we are ready to simplify.
Let me see.
"Actually, let's just add them all up."
Let me do it again.
"The Laplace transform of sine of at is equal to a over s squared, plus a squared."
And that's a significant entry.
"And maybe a good exercise for you, just to see how fun it is to do these integration by parts problems twice, is to figure out the Laplace transform of cosine of at."
And I'll give you a hint.
It's s over s squared over s squared plus a squared.
And it's nice that there's that symmetry there.
"Anyway, I'm almost at my time limit."
And I'm very tired working on this video.
So I'll leave it there and I'll see you in the next one.
I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves before:

It was coming straight for me.
I had to.
"It was, yeah."
"As you can probably well imagine,"
I was a strange child.
(Laughter)
"Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be."
I was constantly experimenting with these noises.
And I'm still on that mission.
I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make.
"And the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises"
"I'll never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it can't do."
And there's things that no one's voice can do.
"For example, no one can do two notes at the same time."
"You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like... (Two-tone singing)"
"I think because now, because even connected to the web uh, I do multimedia for my work too."
So if I created something in there.
There's gotta be finally in the end exported as a.
Multimedia page.
Right.
On there.
Connecting that.
Yeah.
"You know, it would be a lot of free, free videos."
And I've searched for educational page on energy so I have some fun ones that I'd really I ike to put together for kids stuff.
"And, um, there's a lot of, you know, do it, uh, to be able to watch a video and have it actually."
"Get it all together. , out there."
Yeah that's a great idea.
Okay.
"And would you, um, would you find project type courses, maybe past the beginner stage, um, helpful, where you could practice your skills in a certain, um, in a certain environment or piece of software?"
I think...
"Um, I don't usually do the downloads."
"I, I only have a subscription just to watch the videos.'Cause I really never, have never had the time to be able to do one of those full class ones."
"Uh-huh. , The files to work with ."
"Um, I don't, I just don't have that kind of time to be able to use those true detailed trainings."
Sure.
"Um, I mean, if I did I probably would have signed up for that but I only did the one with the crash course videos."
Just the three videos.
That's my subscription on the space there.
"Um, yeah, even with the subscription that you have you still, uh, you can watch all of the different videos."
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Um.
"Yeah, we're just um."
We feel that.
"What we're looking at is expanding from a, uh, a more beginner and foundational level of knowledge."
And how do we start to take deeper dives now?
Is her name Eylul too?
"They are pulling my leg, by God."
Don't worry!
"You weren't here all these years, she didn't love me (all the same)..."
Anyways I don't need her because I love her.
You will take three exams.
"The first is ""General culture"" and you will definitely make it."
"You will have to study for the second one, if it's necessary I will help you, but you already have high grades."
"Are you in ""good level"" for mathematics?"
"Wow, his favorite!"
You will rock!
"Only language is left, you will study a bit for it too.. or if you really want it you will manage it too."
"But forget about it, I think you should study,"
language is always important anyways.
What happened with his mouth today?
I have to occupy my brain or I will swear very badly.
Why?- Forget about it!
It's like that!
The interviewing can be a little hard.
"You shouldn't be excited, but you are cool anyway, you won't be excited."
"But again they will deal with you, it"" obvious."
Eat!
Asim Sekip Kaya University won't give you that scholarship so easily...
"Let me tell you, first Asim Sekip Kaya won't give it to you..."
He won't ever in this life show favor to you.He won't ever in this life show favor to you.
Furthermore he will deal with you.
Don't think it's so easyyyy!!!
You pass this two exams like a lion... after that even if you *** in their mouths during the interview again nothing will happen!
Mert!
Are you doing it intentionally?
"Mom, don't mess with me today!"
It's like that.
Please take good care of her.
Dong-Yi!
"You see this symbol, right?"
Don't forget this symbol.
"If you leave this symbol, this older brother will come find you."
You have to come and get me.
All right!
"Dong-Yi, I promise."
I'll come and get you
Brother Chun-Soo!
"I'm super excited for Family Fest, I actually just found out that my mother is coming which is really nice."
"She'll also be bringing my dog and my little brother, hopefully."
My mom is actually coming up for the first time since she came up first week of orientation.
"My parents have never been to Mac, so it'll be like ""here's my new home!"""
It'll be nice to have them here when I kind of know my way around a little bit more and I can sort of tell them about Macalester.
My grandparents are probably coming out.
"I didn't know they were still mobile, so that should be interesting."
"I'm running the 5k with my mom, and ""running"" is a loose term."
I'm betting my dad will attempt the 5k and then just not want to do it about halfway through.
And then he wants to go to a Wild game so we're going to try to hit that.
"Last year I did the 5k, which was pretty awesome."
Probably we'll be going to a play in Minneapolis hopefully and cooking dinner for her.
She's the best.
I'm also running the 5k with one of my roommates.
"Running, walking the 5k with one of my roommates."
I'm really looking forward to getting some nice meals in good restaurants.
"I don't run, I stand there and watch people run around."
I think we're going to explore Minneapolis because I've pretty much stuck to campus so far.
My mom says she wants to see my apartment.
We'll see how that goes.
I definitely have to clean my dorm room before then.
"I just want to see them, I don't know, they're nice people."
"Yes, so her family knows who we are."
[BOTH LAUGHlNG]

Incoming Call My Love
"By the way, if you have his number... ...I can call him for you."
-Really?
-Yes.
"Anyway, he gave me this paper... ...and asked me to give it to anyone if he is late... ...and who will take this paper will drive me."
Give it to me.
It must be his number.
Maybe he is busy and it is not a good idea to call him
"Just give it to me, will make sure he is fine."
Or you don't want to see Hamada?
"Okay, but when my son come to take me... ...you must come to his house and have lunch with us."
"Please, whoever finds this woman... ...take her to the nearest elderly house."
"So let's do it, lets make a scatter plot."
"To make it easier, on the X axis, we'll say that the miles are in 10,000's."
"So 60,000 will correspond to say, 6 on this axis and the value of the car we'll say is in 1000's."
Click where on this graph these points belong.
Now look I had a fixed formula in all of those.
"If you call the data X₁, X₂ all the way to Xn where n is the number of coin flips,"
"I wonder which of the following formula do you think best capture as what we we're doing the sum/Xi, 1/Nsum/Xi, the product of Xi or 1/Nthe product of Xi."
"This is incomprehensible, Sir!"
They say they already recommended Commissioner Seo as the official in charge of the city!
Isn't that supposed to be your position?
How can your uncle treat you like that?
Don't get overexcited.
I've gained something much greater than that official status.
What?
"Power is not inherited, but is taken by those who wield it."
My uncle has taught me that lesson.
It was a good lesson.
"Recreation, get out of Dodge for 30 days."
So were they here just during the summer?
Yeah.
Nobody was here in the winter at all.
They'd leave and everything.
"Did they interact much with the townspeople, or?"
"Oh, yeah."
They were very friendly with a lot of different people.
"They got to know - like I said, I can't remember any names now, but - they had their free time."
"They had their retreat stuff and their prayer type times and their whatever they would have, but they'd be meandering around the dock or next door."
In the evening I think they might have had a prayer time in the evening because then they'd have a habit or something like that and after their meal they'd walk to the Coast Guard station and back and then disappear.
Go back probably for prayers or something like that.
I don't know what the hell they did.
Any interesting stories about some of them - incidents or anything?
Not really.
That I can think of.
"Talk to Loretta Slaters, she would know."
Because they were right at the end of the row there.
"She would know who the ones were, I think."
She was a little more religious than me.
"And, I'm trying to think who else would have been around at that time."
Donald Cole would be familiar.
So your high school graduating group - what other things did you do with that group?
Those...
I'm not going to put it on tape.
Okay.
"No, the things -"
We set some school records.
We had them cancel -
We used to get a group... we'd go over there and...
They came here so of course we thought we'd just entertain them.
So we did.
"You decrease it to 0, then that'll-- and you could list them all out, 0 through 10-- and then the median number will shift to 5, so that will change it."
"E, increasing the largest number only."
"I can tell you that's the answer from deductive reasoning, but if we just take this 11 and we make it one billion does that change the fact that they're five numbers"
larger than 6 and five numbers less than 6?
Ignore the 0.
Five numbers less than 6?
No.
I can make it into a trillion.
"I can change it to any number, but the fact remains that I have the same amount of numbers larger than 6 as I do below 6."
So choice E cannot affect the value of the median.
E.
Next problem.
"OK, something for me to draw."
"Let's see, they have a 1/4 circle, so I'll just draw a big circle, and I'll just focus on a 1/4 of it."
Close enough.
That looks like a 1/4 of a circle.
"They say that-- oh, and there's a rectangle there too fascinating."
"So this rectangle in this 1/4 circle, so this rectangle could look like this."
"I know theirs looks taller, but I think this will do."
And then I think I'm almost done.
"I think I'm there, I think I can."
"And then they shade in some stuff, so if they shaded it, I will shade it."
A suitably tasteful color.
"OK, so I have shaded what they have shaded."
"And now, what are they saying?"
"They're saying that this is R, C, T, B, S, A."
And then they tell us that is a 90 degree angle.
"And then they tell us that this distance, from here to here, from all the way to the top-- so it's essentially the radius of the circle-- is 6."
The radius of the circle is 6.
"In the figure above, arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6"
Fair enough.
"If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8-- so the length plus the width, so ABCR."
"How much do you have, if the interest rate is eight%?"
2.59 million.
Huge difference in magnitude and who's the culprit?
Compounding.
"In this case, the culprit is helpi ng you."
"But in the case of if you are paying it, it hurts."
"So, we'll do a loan later."
"So, here it's helping you."
"So, let's talk through this problem a little bit."
And so that you understand how empowered you are.
"How empowered actually you are and Finance will make you feel liberated in some, in the simple problem."
"So here, here you go."
"Let me ask you, who decided the 10,000?"
Think about it.
"Who should decide the 10,000 every year?"
You?
Or a financial adviser?
Who?
I hope the answer is you.
"So, 10,000 if you have, I know it's not easy to figure out."
But I would encourage you to think about what your needs are in the future so that you could figure out how much you need to put away.
"And we'll talk, do a problem quite the reverse in a second, say you put away $10,000, who decides that?"
You decide that.
"Second question, what is the other number in this problem?"
It's 40.
How many years to retirement?
"I know you can say that a job may have a retirement age or some sort of, but I, I challenge you in that."
"Hopefully, you will have much more control on when you retire."
Then you think you do.
"By that, I mean you should keep learning in"
"life so that you will always have the opportunity to do something, right?"
And we are talking about the money problem but it could be about anything.
And where is he getting all his protein from?
From this.
"His diet consists of roots, shoots, bamboo and banana."
"He is getting all his calcium, all his iron, all his vitamins, all his minerals, the amino acids from this."
You get everything.
Everything.
Here is the new food pyramid.
There are two things.
Your body is like a machine.
Think of your body as a machine.
You have to put the proper fuels in it to get it to work properly.
"If you don't put the proper fuels, it aint gonna work."
"And if you put fuels that aren't as good quality as others, that will lead to heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol."
"It's like, if you take a Porsche, and you fill it up with diesel, what happens?"
"You just screwed your car up, right?"
"And I guarantee what are people gonna say to you, when you say, I put diesel in my car today."
Do you know what they gonna say to you?
I guarantee they are going to say
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No offense.
"When somebody puts a hamburger in their mouth, nobody says"
"What the fuck is wrong, stop!"
Stop!
You get everything.
I know I said to think your body as a machine now think of your body as a house.
I love analogies.
Think of your body as a house.
"To build a house you have to start with the foundation, you can't start with the roof."
Here is the foundation.
This is the foundation.
This is where all of it starts.
The fruits and vegetables.
"So here, more work is going to get done."
"And now my force, I would say, is maximal."
"So I've got lots, and lots of force finally."
And so it would be something like this.
"And so based on my curve, I've also demonstrated another point, which is that, the first issue, getting us from point one to point two, really helped a lot."
Really.
"I mean, that was the big, big deal."
Because you needed some space here.
"Again, this space really was necessary to do work at all."
"And now that we've gotten rid of the overlap issue, now that we've gotten these last few myosins working, we have even more gain."
But the gain was really-- the biggest advantage was in that first step.
"Now as we go on, let's go to step four."
So this is step four now.
"As we go here, you're going to basically see that this is going to continue to work really well."
"Because you have your actin, like that, and all of your myosins are still involved in making sure that they can squeeze."
So all the myosins are working.
And our titin is just a little bit more stretched out than it was before.
And our force of contraction is going to be maximal.
"And you're going to have-- and so here, I'm drawing the z-discs again."
They're very spread out.
Our sarcomere is getting longer and longer.
And our force of contraction is the same.
"Now let's just take a pause there and say, why is it the same?"
Why did it not go up?
"Well, it's because here, in stage three, you had 20 myosin heads working."
20 out of 20.
"Up here, you had something like 16 out of 20 working."
"Here, we said maybe zero out of 20 right?"
"And here, you again have 20 out of 20."
So you still have an advantage in terms of all of the myosins working.
But there's no difference between 0.3 and 0.4.
"Because again, all the myosins are working."
Today... do what we prepare and present it to the audience
T-ara Fighting Fighting
Now on problem 37.
And they say what is the value of xy minus yz.
"Statement one says, y is equal to 2."
"Well, that by itself doesn't help us."
That just tells us 2x minus 2z.
So if you don't know what x and z are you can't figure out what this whole thing is if you just know y is equal to 2.
So that alone doesn't help.
Statement two is x minus z is equal to 5.
"Now this is interesting because this expression, we can factor out the y."
What happens if we factor y out of both of these expressions?
I'm going to just rewrite it. xy minus zy-- I just switched the y and z-- that equals x minus z times y.
"Well, we can figure out x minus z from statement number two. x minus z, this is equal 5."
And we know what y is equal to from statement one.
So y is equal to 2.
So we can definitely figure it out as long as we have both statements and we can show that the answer is y is equal to 2.
"So the answer is, 2 times 5 is 10."
But we didn't have to figure it out.
We just have to know that we could figure it out if we had both of these data points.
"One by themselves, you wouldn't be able to solve it."
So the answer is C.
Both statements together are sufficient but neither alone is.
Problem 38.
"OK, they drew us a picture."
"Let me see if I can draw that same picture,"
looks like some type of device.
"So it looks like that and then they have the other end, and the other end looks like that."
"There are these handles, or something that looks like handles"
I haven't read the problem yet.
So they say will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?
So this is a book rack.
That is the total number of ways that you can set the
Enigma machine.
This would be an army Enigma machine around about 1939.
-You are telling me that the Germans would send each other messages like Numberphile or send--
DR. JAMES GRlME:
"Yeah, they did that all the time."
-Or send the U-boat to this position or whatever.
But how were they telling each other their plug settings and their starting rotor numbers?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
So this is very important.
"So these two people, who are miles apart, need to have the same setting."
"Now, the setting was written down for you on a piece of paper."
What they would have is a sheet of paper like that.
And it would be a big sheet of paper for each day of the month.
So it was a monthly sheet.
"For each day of the month, they told you how to set the machine for that day."
"If you didn't have this sheet of paper, you wouldn't know what the setting was that you had to use for that day."
"And nice, little story, the Navy would write these code books in soluble ink."
"So if you get sunk, if you get caught, if you throw the code book into water, that's how you keep the secret."
"-It sounds to me that all you need is an Enigma machine and a copy of that book, and you know everything they're saying."
DR. JAMES GRlME:
You would do.
"So if you had the machine and you had that code sheet, you would be able to decode all the messages."
Fantastic.
Great.
But we had the machine.
"And once we've had the machine, we can pull it apart and find out how it works."
Great.
But it was getting those code sheets.
That was difficult.
They were monthly.
They would change every month.
"Second, it has to be in this string."
So a1 does match this regular expression.
"We're looking for things like a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, etc."
There's actually an a1 in this string.
"So, yes."
2b does not match this regular expression.
"For this particular regular expression, the first letter always has to be a letter and not a digit."
This doesn't work out. b2 looks very promising.
"It's one of the strings we would match, except that it's not actually found in our haystack string."
"It can't be part of the return value. cc doesn't match, because we're looking for things like a1, b1, c1 that have a digit in the second position."
This is not a digit. cc3 does not match because it's three characters long and we're looking for strings that are two characters long.
"44 doesn't match, because it doesn't start with a through z. d4 looks very good."
"It's the sort of thing we would match from this regular expression, but it's not actually in our haystack string."
Instead we have 44d.
The empty string--this was a bit of a ringer or distracter thrown in-- doesn't match our regular expression.
It's too short.
"It's zero characters long, and we're matching things that are two characters long."
"But finally c3 matches our regular expression and it's present in the string, so yes."
And the answer is 88.
It takes 7 steps to go from start to goal if we just count the go straight steps.
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
"And we have to turn once in this spot right over here, which costs an additional -5, so we pay a total of -12."
That plus 100 gives us 88.
[ghostly moaning]
-Shut up!
[doorbell rings]
-(Ian and Anthony) Trick or treat!
-Are you a real Ghostbuster?
-Well... not really.
-I have a ghost in my house; I need it gone.
I will pay anything.
"-Hell yeah, we're real Ghostbusters."
"We'll give the whole class time to work with one deck of cards,"
"All 30 of you together, and see how fast you can sort it."
This will be interesting.
We'll [INDAUDlBLE] lab.
"Eh, and we'll see all these problems."
"So there are some common problems with eh, parallel programming, and I will cover three of them today."
The first one is called Race Condition.
The idea is that if two people are trying to use the same resources at the same time.
So let's look at this code.
"Let's say the balance is 100 and, the balance is 100."
The amount is 100 and two people want to withdraw 75 dollars each.
They could get a conflict in this code.
So let's actually try it.
We will set the balance to 500 and broadcast withdraw.
Each sprite with will recive withdraw and withdraw 300.
"And this is the code, the same code."
That if the balance is greater than the amount then set the balance to balance minus amount.
"And eh, so the buffalo withdraws 300 and the star withdraws 400."
So let's see what could happen.
"Eh, oops."
Edit.
Make this bigger.
Zoom in.
"Big, too big."
Maybe.
Still big.
"Okay, so what could happen, maybe the buffalo checks the balance, 500, is greater than his amount, 300, and it is."
And then he sets the balance to 500 minus 300 which is 200 and reports true.
"And then the star comes along and checks if 200 is greater than 400 and it's no, so he reports false."
And no problems right?
"But what could happen is that the star checks if the balance is greater than 400, and it is, and before it gets over here, before it gets to this set, the buffalo comes along and checks if 500 is greater than 300 and he says well, I, there's still enough money in there."
And then they both come in and set the balance to whatever they think it is.
So the third -- the algebra way to look at the
problem is the matrix form and using a matrix that I'll call A.
"Okay, so can I do an example?"
The whole semester will be examples
and then see what's going on with the example.
"So,"
take an example.
"Two equations, two unknowns."
"So let me take 2x -y =0, let's say."
And -x +2y=3.
"Okay. let me -- I can even say right away -- what's the matrix,"
"that is, what's the coefficient matrix?"
The matrix that involves
these numbers -- a matrix is just a rectangular array
of numbers.
"Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and --"
"minus 1 in the first row minus 1 and 2 in the second row,"
that's the matrix.
"And the right-hand -- the,"
"unknown -- well, we've got two unknowns."
"So we've got a vector, with two components, x and x,"
and we've got two right-hand sides that go into a vector 0 3.
"I couldn't resist writing the matrix form, right -- even"
before the pictures.
So I always will think of this as
"the matrix A, the matrix of coefficients, then there's a vector"
of unknowns.
Here we've only got two unknowns.
Later we'll have any
number of unknowns.
"And that vector of unknowns,"
well I'll often -- I'll make that x -- extra bold.
And we said well the acceleration of the pulley is just half the acceleration of the block.
The pulley's velocity and its acceleration is half whatever the block's is.
And so we substituted that in for the acceleration of the pulley.
"And now we can substitute tension, which we solved here, for the-- my mind's getting flustered-- for the tension in this equation."
So what do we get?
We get 150-- let me move back to a nice color-- minus 2 times this expression.
This is the tension in the rope.
"10 times a, b, acceleration of the block, plus 39.2 is equal to 5 times 1/2."
Well what's 5 times 1/2?
It's 2.5 acceleration of the block.
So we have 150 minus 20 times the acceleration of the block minus-- what is this-- 78.4 is equal to 2.5 times the acceleration of the block.
Well let's add 20 times the acceleration of the block to both sides.
"Well, we'll just simplify this."
150 minus 78.4 is equal to 71.6.
So 150 minus 78.4 is 71.6.
So that's just this minus this.
"And I'm going to add 20 a b to both sides, so I'm essentially moving this 20 a b over on that side."
I'm skipping a couple of steps just to save space.
So if I add 20 times the acceleration of the block.
"That's not a, b."
It's a sub b.
You get 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
"And this is a 6, not a block."
71.6 is equal to 22.5 times the acceleration of the block.
We're almost done.
So we divide both sides by 22.5 and what do we get?
Let's see.
"Divided by 22.5, and we get the acceleration of the block."
So that's this block right here.
The acceleration of the block is 3.18 meters per second squared.
That's how fast this thing accelerates to the right.
And we already figured out that the pulley accelerates at half that rate.
I've missed her a lot.
"We talk on the phone, but of course that's never quite the same as hanging out with your parents in real life."
"It's such a nice togetherness, you know?"
I like it.
I like watching people walk around with their parents because I think it makes people make more sense.
I like seeing freshman run to their parents because they haven't seen them in so long.
That'll be me this year.
We're told to graph this system of equations and identify the number of solutions that it has.
And they have the system of equations here.
So they want us to graph each of these equations and think a
little bit about the solutions.
"So the first equation here-- I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph it in the same color that I write it."
"This first equation's already in slope-intercept form, y is equal to 3x plus 1."
"We see that the slope, or m, is equal to 3, and we see that the y-intercept here is equal to 1."
"So let me be clear, that is also the slope."
I just called it m because a lot of times people say y is equal to mx plus b.
So we can graph it.
"We can look at its y-intercept, the point 0, 1 must be on this graph."
"So that's the point 0, 1 right there."
"This is the y-axis, that is the x-axis."
And the slope is 3.
"That means if we move 1 in the positive x-direction, we're going to move up 3 in the positive y-direction."
"So we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3."
"If we moved 2 in the x-direction, we would move up 6."
Just like that.
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.
"Likewise, if we moved down 1, if we went negative 1 in x, we would go negative 3 in y."
"So negative 1, negative 3."
Because negative 3 divided by negative 1 is still 3.
"If we went negative 2 in x, we would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in y."
"So these are all points along the line, and I can connect the dots now."
We got a couple of drops out.
So this is ready to go now.
And I can hook this up.
"Now, I'm going to put my drip chamber in here and this stretchy tubing goes below."
My tubing fits in here.
"Then this stretchy tubing, I'm going to use this little blue handle to help me loop this around, and it fits right in that little port."
Okay?
And I need to attach it to my patient.
"And again, before I have done this, before I do this, I would have checked for residual, checked for placement, I opened up my stopcock so it'll flow between the patient, into the patient from the bag."
Now I'm going to set my pump for what I need to run it at.
"So we first turn it on, and it says, ""Set dose."""
And that's the total volume you're going to give.
"So if we want to give 200 cc's, hold that down until we get to 200."
Hold that down.
There we go.
I went over a little bit.
Sorry.
Went over.
Okay.
So my dose is 200.
I need to set my rate.
"And that might be 30 cc's an hour, whatever your order says is what you would set it for."
Okay.
"So, I've set my rate, I've set my dose, and I hit run."
"Again, you want to make sure your patient is not flat, while they're receiving feedings, so they don't aspirate."
"Even though you're receiving, giving tube feedings on a pump, you still need to periodically check for residual and to give some free water per the order to give the patient some extra water."
"BYU-Idaho has additional facilities at off-campus locations such as the Outdoor Learning Center at Badger Creek with ropes courses and cross-country skiing and the Sky Mountain and Quickwater Lodges in the Teton Valley near Victor, Idaho."
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
If you said goodbye to me tonight
And it comes up and over like that.
So this is kind of what the actin would look like.
"And, of course, I want to make sure I draw my titin."
"Titin is kind of helpful, because it helps demonstrate that there's now a little bit of space there where there wasn't any before."
And so now there is some space between the z-disc and this myosin right here.
So there is some space between these myosins and the z-discs.
"In fact, I can draw arrows all the way around."
And so there is a little bit of work to be done.
But I still wouldn't say that it's maximal force.
"Because look, you still have some overlap issues."
"Remember, these myosins, right here, they're not able to work."
"And neither are these, because of this blockage that's happening here."
This blockage.
"Because of the fact that, of course, actin has a certain polarity."
So they're getting blocked.
They can't do their work.
"And so even though you get some force of contraction, it wouldn't be maximal."
So I'll put something like this.
This will be our second spot.
This will be number two.
"Now in number three, things are going to get much better."
So you'll see very quickly now you have a much more spread out situation.
Where now these are actually-- these actins are really not going to be in the way of each other.
"You can see they're not bumping into each other, they're not in the way of each other at all."
And so all of the myosins can get to work.
So the z-discs are now out here.
"My overall sarcomere, of course, as I said, was from z-disc to z-disc."
So my sarcomere is getting longer.
"And you can also see that because now there's more titin, right?"
And there isn't actually more titin.
I shouldn't use that phrase.
But the titin is stretched out.
"So let's see, this is time 0, this is 5 seconds."
"So if we look at the hare's position after 5 seconds, so after time equals 5 seconds, it does indeed look like the hare's position-- the hare is just sitting there at the 90-foot marker line and is not moving at all."
The rate of change of position with respect to time for the hare at that point is 0.
"So this does seem true, it just doesn't apply to the question."
It's not the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on this interval.
This is applying to H of t.
The hare runs at a speed of 18 feet per second for the first 5 seconds.
So let's see if this is true.
"For the first 5 seconds, so this is 5 seconds going by, the hare is able to cover a distance of 90 feet."
"So the hare is able to go 90 feet in 5 seconds, so for the first 5 seconds, the hare is-- hare's rate is 90 feet."
You could say average rate of change is 90 feet in 5 seconds.
And 90 divided by 5 is indeed 18 feet per second.
"So once again, this third statement is true, it just doesn't apply to T of t."
It's not addressing the question.
Now this fourth choice is that the hare wins the race.
"Now, winning the race, they have to get to 100 feet in the shortest amount of time."
This is 100 feet right over here.
So let's see.
So it looks like only the tortoise even gets to that point.
"At 20 seconds, the tortoise gets to the 100-foot mark."
The hare is still hanging around taking a nap or something at 90 feet.
So this is actually outright false.
The tortoise wins the race.
So we will definitely go with our first choice.
"Fred:Hey, it's Fred, and today's May Day."
"Yay, May Day!"
"So, yeah I'm gonna deliver everyone in my whole entire neighborhood May baskets."
Full of love and happiness.
"I don't know if you already realised this, but, my mom got me a ""Fred"" shirt."
"She said that we can't afford to get a lot of shirts, so, I'm just gonna wear this shirt for the rest of my life."
"No offense to you guys who have a ton of shirts, but, it's more cool just to have one shirt."
I hope I didn't offend anybody.
I always had to go in there and fiddle them.
"Then another version of WOlips would come out, and I'd have to change the things again."
In ANT 1.6 they added the ability to import one build.xml file into another.
That's a really good thing to do.
"For an example of doing things like that, see the Wonder build system."
"It is really quite complex, but you can find a lot of interesting things in there."
I'm currently redoing our build system so that I have a couple of shared files that all the projects use.
This is what I've ended up for a build file for a WO framework.
"That's it, three lines and a couple properties."
It's a lot easier to maintain.
- OK.
Just one comment on that.
Look at Maven.
You can actually build some awesome tools with Maven.
I think there was a demonstration last year from Jake.
Maven is actually an extremely good tool to build Web Objects.
That's how we build Web Object every night.
We use Maven.
We've got a Maven build system for Web Objects.
It's really awesome.
It takes care of all the dependency.
"It's really reliable, in fact, you don't have to write much code if you accept two of the Maven conventions."
- I don't.
- We use some funky tools.
You can ask Mike.
"Every time I tell him one of them he goes, ""Oh, I want to die."""
"Our build files are highly customized, so I don't know how happy it would be with Maven, but I'm not going to go there."
"There was a question and answer here, I've been doing some questions."
I'm going to skip over this.
"We don't have time to go into the fun topics, but if you want something to talk about over beer tonight..."
"- They're hard to read from this distance, and we'll take that as a good thing."
- It didn't look so bad on the screen.
40.
"So, please re, remember there's always one more point in time than the number of periods."
"If you remember that or if you recognize that, you'll be okay."
"So, how maNy points in time, 41."
"Zero, one through 40."
How many periods of time?
"Well, it takes two points of time to make a period, so there one less."
"One, two."
"So, what we'll do to make our life simple is we'll assume that the first $10,000 is at the end of the year."
Why did I do that?
I could always start saving at this point.
"But I'm doing it simply so that I can use the formula and, just directly, you know."
"Use the calculator, and do it, and setup."
"We can change that, so don't worry."
"You can start a payment today, and change it."
It's just a minor difference.
How much?
"Another thing that seems a little bit odd or manufactured in this formula is that you are saving at year 40 too, right, you may not be, right or actually messed up saving in between."
"So, but for convenience, we are trying to understand the problem which is got 40 of these guys, alright."
"So, the good news is even though this formula is very complicated, right, you divide this by how much?"
"I mean, you carry it forward by how much?"
One period but there's no money.
How much do you carry this forward by?
39 periods.
How much do you carry this forward by?
38.
Which is the simplest piece of this?
This guy.
Why?
"Because I'm askin g you, what is the future value at this point in time, alright."
"So, the future value of this point in time of this guy is just itself."
"That's the, that's what I mean, if you learn how to travel in time."
"Ocean."""
And he points out there.
(Laughter)
"But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the lower 48."
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.
"But he looked at me, and he said, ""Son"" -- he's my age, by the way, he calls me son, I love that -- he says, ""Son, I'm a captain of a crab boat."
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.
"My responsibility is to get you home rich."""
(Laughter)
"You want to get home alive, that's on you."
"And for the rest of that day, safety first."
I was like --
"So, the idea that we create this false -- this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility as though it's our own, and vice versa."
"Anyhow, a whole lot of things."
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
"But, what it all comes down to is this."
"I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds."
"It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us."
It's a civil war.
"It's a cold war, really."
"We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it."
"And we've waged this war on at least four fronts, certainly in Hollywood."
The way we portray working people on TV -- it's laughable.
"If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds and he's got a giant butt crack."
Admit it.
You see him all the time.
"That's what plumbers look like, right?"
"We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines."
That's what TV does.
"We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"" not to do that, which is why I do the work and I don't cheat."
"But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue."
"I mean, so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message, what's really being said?"
They can't be p.
They only get as high as p minus 1.
This is not an option.
"So the only possibility, if a is equal to 0, for the determinant of capital A to still be divisible by p, is for bc to be equal to 0."
So let's think about how many possibilities there are over here.
So let's think about all of the combinations.
"So there's the one situation, where b and c are equal to 0. b and c is equal to 0."
Now let's think about the other ones.
There's one where b is equal to 0 and c isn't. bc will still equal 0 in this situation.
So how many possibilities are there?
How many possibilities are there for this?
"Well, b is equal to 0."
"C over here can be any value, although we've already considered the case where c is equal to 0."
"So it could be any value so that we don't double count, any value where c does not equal 0."
So it could be 1 through p minus 1.
"Or another way to think about it, there's p minus 1 possibilities."
Now let's think about c is equal to 0 and b isn't.
"Well, exact same logic."
"Once again, we don't want to double count that they're both being equal to 0."
So let me write it.
"And c isn't-- well, we're saying it isn't 0, so we are actually already putting that constraint there."
So it has p minus 1 possibilities.
So how many total possibilities do we have where the determinant of A is equal to 0 and a is equal to 0?
So we have one here.
"We have one possibility here, then p minus 1 and p minus 1."
"So our total possibilities are p minus 1 plus p minus 1 plus 1, which is 2p minus 2 plus 1, which is 2p minus 1."
2p minus 1 incremental possibilities when a is equal to 0 for the determinant of A to be divisible by p.
So that's what we just got in this video.
"In the last video, we had p minus 1 squared possibility when a does not equal 0."
"So if we want the total number of A's, where the determinant of A is divisible by 0, we can add the number that we got in the last video to the number we just got."
So let's do that.
"So if I were to rewrite this over here, this is equal to p squared minus 2p plus 1."
There's a kind of a lot going on now with the online and open access.
Right.
Can you say a little bit about what's gonna happen for in the future.
[laugh].
"But you described, [laugh]."
"You know, more, less paper, more electronic, [laugh]."
Publications.
It'll appear faster.
Yeah.
"You know, like e-Pub before, before it appears."
Right.
In the paper version.
There'll be more new journal.
"I keep getting emails from journals that just started up, you know, and they'll make it sound like it's your field."
And there's probably not such great peer review with them.
They wanna.
"This time they might get some known authors and publish but the, I have had a paper."
"You know which was submitted to a journal that's supposed to be peer reviewed and, and the acceptance came back in about five days."
[laugh]
Right.
You know?
"So I don't think it was really peer reviewed I, of course you know I'm biased but I thought it was a decent paper and, but I don't think it got the kind of peer review that papers normally get from good journals."
"Do you think peer reviews going to be, gonna change somewhat in the future because of this proliferation of online journals?"
Say that again.
"Do you think that the peer review process itself is going to change them like, because of the proliferation of online journals?"
"Well, it shouldn't, but it, it might."
I'm not sure how.
Yeah.
"You know, if they're really in a hurry to publish, they might say, you know, get your review back in a week or, you know."
Yeah.
A lot of people just can't do that.
"That fast, yeah."
"Okay, I'm gonna note the time here:"
7:47 is when I turned it on.
Doesn't look like it's quite ready for the egg; what I'm looking for to know when it's time to put the egg on is for the oil to sort of spread out on its own.
The induction cooktop doesn't use a lot less electricity than the radiant element; it's just that it uses it for a much shorter time.
And this is probably the best illustration of it.
"If I were using the induction cooktop, my egg would be well along its way by now."
And I'm going to put this in here and I bet it's gonna be a little cool.
"Yeah, it's a little cool for the egg right now."
"As you can see it's being . . . that's a little cooler than I would want to put an egg in, but I'm sort of out of the habit of using the radiant eye, so I forget how to judge that."
"And Amanda likes a little pepper on hers, so actually she likes a LOT of pepper on hers"
[Amanda chuckles]
And now I'm gonna wait for a second because it's got some cooking to do before we're ready to turn it.
I put the egg in too soon.
Should have waited even longer to put it in.
If I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do one of those
"""time passes"" things (Note:"
I'm no real man . . .)
"Okay it's 7:48 now, I guess, so it's been in there for . . ."
Well we'll figure that out.
We'll probably flash it on the screen how long it's been in at this point.
Note: call it 2 minutes 50 seconds so far . . .
"Whatever you do then, Honey, don't let it stop."
Just let it keep rolling.
"I'll let it cook a little bit longer before I try to turn it, because I want to see that middle area there harden up."
You're probably a little close for focus.
(Note:
She was fine . . .)
[Spatula scraping on pan]
Probably turned it sooner than I should have.
[Amanda: looks good.]
Looks good?
Okay.
So this is in meters.
"0.5 meters, so that alone doesn't help us."
We have to be able to figure out the circumference of this tub in order to really be able to figure out the surface area because the circumference times this height will be the surface area.
Point two: they say the height of the tub is one meter.
So they're telling us that this is one meter.
Well that doesn't help us.
That still doesn't tell us how far around the tub goes.
If they had given us the diameter or the radius or the circumference then we could've used our basic geometry to figure out the circumference.
But they didn't.
So either way-- it's a one meter height-- both of these combined still do not allow us to figure out the surface area of this green band.
E again.
Problem 40.
What is the value of integer n?
And n as an integer.
So statement number one: they tell us that n times n plus 1 is equal to 6.
"Now we should already be able to figure this out because n is an integer, n plus 1 is an integer."
So what are the factorizations of 6?
You could have 1 times 6.
"But that doesn't fit n and n plus 1, right?"
This is n and n plus 5.
"You have 2 times 3, which work, right."
"If 2 is n, n plus 1 is 3 and they equal 6."
So let me circle that.
And then what other factorizations?
You don't have any other-- these are all of the factors 6.
"So just looking at the first statement, you know that n has to be equal to 2."
This is the only integer where this is true.
"Actually, let me take a step back."
"No, what if n is negative?"
"Because I was assuming it's a positive integer but they didn't say it's a positive integer, so let me think about that."
"If I did minus 3 times minus 2, that also equals 6 and these are both integers."
"Huh, OK, so this isn't enough."
"But once you have the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard deviation."
You just take the square root of it.
The square root of 7.76-- 2.78.
Let's say 2.79 is the standard deviation.
"So this gives us some measure of, on average, how far the numbers are away from the mean which was 4.2."
And it gives it in kind of the units of the original measurement.
"Anyway, I'm all out of time."
I'll see you in the next video.
"Or actually, let's figure out-- we said if this was a sample, if those numbers were sample and not the population, that we figured out that the sample variance was 9.7."
And so then the sample standard deviation is just going to be the square root of that.
The square root of 9.7 seven which would be 3.1.
3.11.
"Anyway, hopefully that makes it a little bit more concrete."
We've been dealing with these sigma notation variables and all that so far.
So when you actually do it with numbers you see it's hopefully not that difficult.
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
Fucking Christ.
What the fuck?
"One minute I'm minding my own business - shoot'n pool, downing shots of who-the-fuck-knows-what and suddenly.."
POOOOOOF
I mean fairy-fucking-godmother?!?
How the hell is this her jurisdiction?
Man. my head.
What the hell was in those shots?
I mean seriously.
All i did was rent a few dogs.
Oh.. and sewed a few sticks to their heads.
Alright. and glued a red light to that little ones nose but fucking christ give me a break...
I did a dime of shrooms earlier.
I needed some light. and (chuckling) i thought he looked cute.
Is that a fucking crime?!?
"How was I to know that abandoned sled in front of city hall belonged to some ""princess""?!?"
Or I'll push them away.
It's... it's not something that right now I want to feel in my life.
"For me, it's gotta be my family."
"When you realise the reality of love not lasting, with my parents breaking up."
For me that totally shook everything I knew.
Umm.
"You know, they're the ones who are always meant to be together, that are always meant to love each other."
"It's the most painfull thing that I've ever felt, and it wasn't even me involved in the love."
[soft music continues]
"God's unconditional love, I struggle with."
"I mean, I know it's real... but I struggle to feel it."
"I guess when I've had such a mixed up view of love, that is so painful, when I know that there is an unconditional love, I just don't... it doesn't connect to me."
But I guess to me it's... it doesn't mean that it's not real at all.
I struggle to feel His love.
"I struggle to, to know."
Knowing that there's love.
Out there.
Even though I don't feel it.
Knowing that someone else does.
Knowing that it actually exists.
"Just because I fall, doesn't mean I should crawl for the rest of my life,"
I should get back up.
"And I know that one day, I'll learn to love."
And I'll learn to be loved.
"'Cause I guess for me, where there's another day, there's still hope for it to happen."
"When people have diabetes, their bodies aren't able to keep their blood sugar in balance."
So sometimes they need to take regular doses of a medicine that helps restore that balance.
People with depression have the same  kind of problem with their brain chemicals.
But regular doses of antidepressants can keep these chemicals in balance.
"As a first year intern you have very little free time, so when you finally have a night off, it's important that you do something constructive with it."
Hey man how's it goin?
Hey wait a second.
Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
"Now, mostly we're looking for correct code."
"If you wrote some more tests, you may start to have some more confidence in the code that we have."
We're also considering efficiency to some degree.
It seems like there's a big problem with the efficiency of the program we have so far.
Let me show you one of the issues.
"Now we represented states as a (here, there, t) triplet."
"The problem with this is there can be two states that have identical here and there's but differ in the t, and they're going to be considered different states."
Why is that a problem?
Consider this problem.
"We have two people--one who takes 1 unit to cross the bridge, and one who takes 1000."
It seems pretty clear there is an easy solution.
The two of them go across together.
"It takes 1000, but look how we're going to explore this space."
"We're going to start out in the initial state that took time 0, and then we're going to start adding things to the frontier."
"Out of all the ways we could cross, the one that adds the least is for the 1 to go across by himself."
Now he's on the other side with the 1 on the other side and the 1000 on the original side.
That only took 1 step.
Now what's the fastest thing we can do after that?
We could take 1 more step and go back to the original state.
Here we had 1 and we'll call K for the 1000 on the left-hand side.
Here K was left behind and 1 went over to the right.
"Here we took one more time unit, and we had 1, K on this side."
"If we continue taking the fastest step we can, we'll get to another distinct state where K is on this side and 1 is on the other side."
The flashlight is always going with the 1.
"It's part of your job to convince yourself that you feel comfortable with it, and."
The blue dots are the only things you save.
"Now, let's take a look at this when we scale it."
"Cuz, nobody's going to solve this thing on a for, fiv, four by four domain."
"Right, I mean, you're going to need a lot more points."
"You might say, I'm going to chop up my X domain into a 100 points."
"And then you spy that thing and, boom, this things huge, 10,000 by 10,000 matrix."
Okay so this is kinda what we're looking at.
We're going to be working with that matrix.
Now you see how white that is?
That's cuz there's all zeros there.
You don't want to save all that.
You know how many components you'd have to save?
"10,000 by 10,000."
"I'll let you do the math, in your head."
"Right, this is huge."
"Ten to the five squared if you want to save this in memory, you gotta eat up all that memory to save a bunch of zeros."
Spdiags changes your game.
Bring you up a level because now you can do this thing with sparse extinct.
"Now, one last thing I want to do."
"Let's go back down to five, and we're not on these five, we're going to say, hey, what's the determinant of that matrix?"
"Huh, that's not zero."
Ten to the seventeen.
If you see a number like this.
That's bad okay.
So the condition number is the measure you want to look for cuz that determiner actually said oh by the time I was three that's not done yet that's pretty far away from zero all things considered.
The problem really comes if you look at the condition number.
"Anything you're like when you start gaining ten of five, ten of six you're kind of like ooo that's looking singular."
Ten of seventeen says dude I am totally singular.
"To you,"
That's the interpretation of that.
"Okay, If I, wrote mat lab, I would have a"
"I say, good luck to you, if that's the route you decide to go on."
"But, honestly folks, at the end of the day, just having the God-given talent, a pen and a piece of paper to draw on is really all you need to become an artist."
"Develop your skills early, be passionate and diligent in your work and you, at that point, will be well on your way to becoming an artist."
It doesn't matter what type of artist at that point.
"You, my friend are definitely an artist."
So no one told you life was going to be this way.
"Your job's a joke, you're broke, you're love life's DOA."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
I'll be there for you cause you're there for me too.
"You're still in bed at ten, the work began at eight."
"You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great."
"Your mother warned you there'd be days like these,"
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought down to your knees.
"That, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."
"No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me."
Seems like you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me.
"Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with,"
"Someone I'll always laugh with even at my worst, I'm best with you."
"It's like you're always stuck in second gear,"
"Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year."
"But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour."
"I'll be there for you,"
like I've been there before.
"I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too."

We have a lot of crowding issues.
"That's kind of the major issue, right?"
"Because you can see that our titin, which is in green, is really not allowing any space."
"Or there is no space, really."
"And so, these ends, remember these are our z-discs right here."
This is Z and this is Z over here.
Our z-discs are right up against our myosin.
"In fact, there's almost no space in here."
This is all crowded on both sides.
There's no space for the myosins to actually pull the z-disc any closer.
"So because there's no space for them to work, they really can't work."
"And really, if you give them ATP and say, go to work."
"They're going to turn around and say, well, we've got no work to do, because the z-disc is already here."
"So in terms of force of contraction for this scenario one, I would say, you're going to get almost no contraction."
"So when the length is very low, so let's say this is low."
Maybe low is not a good word for length.
"Let's say this is, I'll use the word short."
The sarcomere is short.
And here the sarcomere is long.
"So when it's short, meaning this distance is actually very short, then we would say the amount of tension is going to be actually zero."
Because you really can't get any tension started unless you have a little bit of space between the z-disc and the myosin.
"So now in scenario two, let's say this is scenario two."
And this is my one circle over here.
"In scenario two, what happens?"
"Well, here you have a little bit more space, right?"
So let's draw that.
Let's draw a little bit more space.
Let's say you've got something like that.
"And I'm going to draw the other actin on this side, kind of equally long, of course."
I didn't draw that correctly.
"Because if it's sliding out, you're going to have an extra bit of actin, right?"
Something like that.
"I don't like these one halves lying around, so let's multiply both sides, this equation, by 2."
I'm just gonna multiply both sides by two.
"So, on the left hand side, I'm just left with (a+b) squared, and on the right hand side, I'm left with 2ab and then two times one half c squared, i.e., plus c squared."
What happens if you multiply out (a+b) times (a+b)?
We get (a+b) squared.
That is a sq. + 2ab+ b sq. = 2ab + c sq.
"Subtracting 2ab from both sides, we are left with, a sq. + b sq. = c sq. i.e. the Pythagorean theorem."
OK.
"What we see here, is a 3D maze."
"It's actually HTML, CSS3, and a bit of Javascript but the CSS3 is 3-dimensional CSS."
"What we've got is a whole bunch of cubes, stacked in bars, and we've got one red ball in the upper left corner."
"And I can move that ball with the buttons up on top to the right, down..."
Why?
"Because there's cubes that are opened and cubes that are closed, which are part of the maze set-up."
"The proof of concept is created with one singular maze, in the end product it will be possible to incorporate different mazes."
I can move the ball by clicking the correct button.
"I just went right and as you see, there's a little marker line that says I moved to a different bar."
"Now I can't go anywhere else,"
"I can go back left, that's where I came from,"
"I can go back right or come forth, and this way"
I can walk through the entire maze.
The objective of the maze is to clear the maze.
"Rather, the objective of the game is to clear the maze."
"On this side there is one more block open, that has no front."
"If I go through there,"
I'm out of the maze and I will not be able to use any of the buttons anymore.
"I can only go back and forth, I can go down, and I can walk my way all around through the maze."
Just like this.
"Oops, can't do that."
I can come forth and left and forth and left...
"Well, you get the idea."
Now this maze obviously is quite simple.
It was only a spelling mistake
I am the Math Monster
"I am not very good at spelling and .. why are you here? why am I here? huh, why am I here? ...hang on a minute well, 2 plu2 is 4 and 2 times2 is also 4 it is obvious that you are confused  in your Math and I am here due to your lies."
lies? lies?what lies? the lie where you said that you have done your homework and you have not done it. your'e the lier! ok then what is 2307.5 by one?
2307 by one? no!
"2307.5 by one ah, 2370.5 by one? yes , tell me"
"I know that one, I studied it no, you did not study it yes I did, no you didn't no, yes ay, couldn't we have entered in a more civilized manner? no , because we are not human we are not civilized"
"Is this the castle of lies? no, yes make up your minds won't you? well of course it is. you could say it is this little girl is lying through her teeth this little girl said she did her Math homework but no, it is not true she has not done it , No!"
"look, I am not a lier"
"I have witnesses ay yes , of course , ah yes ok then I will go and get them"
I will go look for them don't take too long
"Ay Sir Pigwig , what good fortune"
"Ah, Griselda,  how are you on such a beautiful day? super ah, this makes me very happy knowing that you and your family are very well very well, actually what is happening is that I did not do my Math homework and I need someone to say that I did ."
Do you think you could help me?
Lie?
Lie for you? in such difficult times? and for such a beautiful damsel as you
YES
Where are you Sir Pigwig? ah ha ha ha
"Now let's see...what is 2 plus 2? ah, ah and two times 2 4, 4 , but what have I done that you should treat me thus?"
You have colaborated with  the lies of grumbly girl
"Griselda, my name is Griselda"
"OK, ok, Griselda aha, and now , what do you say? what is 2307.5 by one? think about it well did you do your Math homework or not? ahh so, you see ha, I knew it you don't know the difference between adding and multiplication well, I can see there is a relationship when I add a lie, my problems multiply ha,ha,ha..."
Griselda
"Griselda, the only solution add-subtract multiply-divide they are all opposites they cancel out add, subtract."
"Multiply, divide.."
"lies? what is the opposite of lies? ha, ha, ha... the truth is the opposite of lies and you need to say it before everyone."
"OK, I'll do it!"
Ladies and gentlemen... people of the kingdom
I can see that I have caused anguish  with my lies
"I have caused anguish for everyone and so, I have decided to tell you all that I..."
I did not do my math homework! ha ha ha... what? huh? huh? hey guys guys... she confessed! she confessed! ay no! we're dead!!!
2 times 2 is four that means that two plus two is 4 ah!
Outliers get squared.
Right?
"So if you're really bad, you square it, to get even that much worse."
Okay?
"Now, it could be that, in fact, that outlying data shouldn't take up that much importance, but when you do the"
L^ The square fit with the L2.
You square that distance and you put it into that thing.
Where is if you do L1?
"You just take the distance and leave it, you don't square it."
Okay.
How does it impact this example?
Well let's see.
I'm gonna put in some outliers.
"So I'm gonna add a couple data set points here here's my data, here's what I'm gonna add at .5, it's at 3.8 and at 3.9 Now, let's try it."
"Okay, there is are results, so I added a couple points, outliers to the data."
And now You can see there's a pretty pronounced difference between the L2 and the L1.
"And then, we can talk about, well, what's best?"
"So, first of all, that's question doesn't even make sense."
"Because when we say, what's best, you could say, well, if it's an L2 sense, clearly, the red line is best because it minimizes the L2."
"So, best here is."
"Akward, mathematically its best and best by the eye."
And then look at the magenta line.
The magenta line really doesn't change because of the outliers.
"Right, hardly influenced by them, shifted slightly."
The red took a huge tilt.
"So some would argue that when we answer the question about what is best, that in fact, the magenta is best, cuz it does not react to the outliers, and the only reason that red, and that red line got way shifted, because it's trying to compensate for these points that are way out squared the distance analysis and this red line doesn't do the job at all, bottom points or the top points, doesn't, doesn't do well anywhere."
"But the L1 says, tell you what, I got most of them right, I got a couple of outliers."
"But by the way, nobody is gonna get the ou tliers right, so I'll try to get the bulk of them right."
Does that make sense?
"Okay, that's the L1 norm."
All right.
So curve fits.
I've gone from one problem size eight down to eight problems of size one.
At this stage I'm at my singleton case.
So this is easy.
What do I do?
I merge.
"And the merge is, put them in order."
What do I do next?
"Obvious thing, I merge these."
And that as we saw was a nice linear operation.
"It's fun to do it upside down, and then one more merge which is I take the smallest elements of each one until"
I get to where I want.
Wow aren't you impressed.
"No, don't please don't clap, not for that one."
Now let me do it a second time to show you that --
I'm saying this poorly.
Let me say it again.
That's the general idea.
What should you see out of that?
"I just kept sub-dividing down until I got really easy problems, and then I combine them back."
"I actually misled you slightly there or maybe a lot, because"
I did it in parallel.
"In fact, let me just shuffle these up a little bit."
"Really what's going to happen here, because this is a sequential computer, is that we're going to start off up here, at top level, we're going to divide into half, then we're going to do the complete subdivision and merge here before we ever come back and do this one."
We're going to do a division here and then a division there.
"At that stage we can merge these, and then take this down, do the division merge and bring them back up."
Let me show you an example by running that.
I've got a little list I've made here called test.
"Let's run merge sort on it, and then we'll look at the code."
"OK, what I would like you to see is I've been printing out, as I went along, actually let's back up slightly and"
look at the code.
There's merge sort.
Takes in a list.
There's an S in there.
"The sparse diagonal matrix means what you're going to do is, you're going to basically so it's going to be a matrix fulls of zeroes, and you're gonna tell me which diagonals have stuff in'em, and put stuff on those diagonals."
"So, for instance, here's how you might put something in."
"So, first, you tell it."
Let me give you the structure here.
It's going to be an n by n matrix.
Doesn't have to be.
"You can tell it what size it is, but for us it's an n by n."
You tell it the location of where you wanna put this thing.
"So, for instance, if I wanna put something on the diagonal at zero, if I go to the right of the diagonal, it's one, two, three."
"Go to the left, it's negative one, negative two, negative three."
"So your location is predicated off that diagonal, to the right or to the left."
"So if you say zero, and what I'm going to do is put."
Lay down an E1 on that.
So right now what I've made is essentially the identity matrix.
Here's another command.
Spy.
"Spy allows you to look at the, all the non zero components, of the matrix."
"So if I do this, press go."
"There's my matrix structure, the blue dots indicate which things are not zero."
"By the way, by using the SP Diags."
The only things it saves is the blue dots.
"Notice the matrix is sparse, it's almost empty."
"If you were to save all these zeroes, right, order N squared matrix, the memory requirement would be order N squared for you."
"To save all these things as zeroes, if you save it as a sparse matrix, it's order N. 'Kay."
Be easy on your chip.
Try not to save memory stuff.
You're going to have to use your memory for other things besides saving matrices.
Okay?
"So, this is what's nice about this."
"So, hey, look at that."
I put down a diagonal.
They had a lot of sailors from the island.
"My uncle was telling me one time, I forget how many cousins he had that were captains on boats."
But that was when there were 70 ore boats.
You'd go up in the evening time and watch them going up Sand Bay.
"They all did the same speed, they all burned coal in the 50s."
"There was nothing to see, a dozen, right after the other lined up at the same speed, just heading for"
Grey's Reef there.
They did the same thing -
"In the day you'd see the smoke, but at night you'd see the lights go by."
"And when you went across on the mail boat, you always passed in front of one or behind one."
Heading down to Charlevoix or coming back up.
There was an awful lot of guys.
"When we put up ice here, our whole crew pretty much would be - we'd have 8, 10 guys down there."
They all were sailors that were just home for the winter.
They laid the boats up the first of December and go back in March.
"Unless a guy had lucked out to get the job for the winter staying on the boat, just to keep an eye on things."
"Like I said, [?]'s husband."
He'd always run what we called The Jack.
We had a movable thing to - when you put the ice up in the ice house the ramp and everything.
You walked alongside and it was just a little plank.
I don't know if I could -
"So, you'd pull the ice up."
These cakes up to the foot of the thing.
And then the other team - some guy driving the team.
"One of the sailors, he'd have the team."
Then they used the team to pull four of these blocks up.
Ray would be the guy behind us at what we called the
Jack.
He took a 12 by 12 plank with a bunch of spikes through it and then a big handle - to guide the - you hook on behind him and they'd keep on skidding it up.
And there'd be two or three guys up inside the ice house itself.
"They have these big ice tongs, skid it around, and they'd jam them and they'd tape it together."
So it was like one solid block of ice.
And twist the third red bubble.
Lock the free end of the third pinnk and red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the third gray bubble.
And twist the third yellow bubble.
Lock the free ends of the third gray and yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Alright.
Let's take a look on our sculpture.
"Basically, we are making the same fabric as we did in previously published instructions"
"""Fabric 2"", ""Fabric 3""."
The big difference here is we connect both ends of each row in this sculpture.
Twist the fourth yellow and the fourth red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the fourth yellow and fourth red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the fourth gray and twist the fourth pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the fourth gray and fourth pink bubble in one lock twist.
Keep working in the same fashion.
We can make as many rows as we want.
In this example we use only four balloons to build the tower.
We can use any even number of balloons to build larger in diameter tower.
There is also no limit how high you can make it.
Just add balloons as you need it.
Here is time saving way to make this sculpture.
Hold and twist balloons together to make the bubbles and
lock the ends in one lock twist in one move.
Twisting different size bubbles will definitely distort the tower.
Fix it right away.
I have mentioned before that we can make the tower as tall as we want.
"Let's limit our self here, for this instruction."
So far we have twisted six rows.
Or six bubbles of each color.
Now we have to build a cabin on the top of the crane tower.
We can make different size bubbles to make the cabin in different ways.
Let's do it in the simplest way.
This was 5 times 1 minus 1.
"Yeah, 5 times 0 minus x1, which is 1."
"Now, this case, it's 5 times-- oh, I have to be careful."
This is 5 times x2. x2 is 1.
"So 5 times 1 minus 0, so it's 5."
"And then I have 4 times 0 plus x2, plus 1."
"And I just showed you if I replace each of these standard basis vectors with the transformation of them, what do I get?"
I get this vector right here.
So I already figured out what they are.
"If I take this guy and evaluate it, it's the vector 1, minus 1, 4."
"And then this guy is the vector 3, 5, and 1."
So what we just did and this is-- I don't know.
"For some reason, I find this to be pretty amazing."
We can now rewrite this transformation here as the product of any vector.
"So if we define this to be equal to a, or we could write it this way."
We can now write our transformation.
"Our transformation of x1, x2 can now be rewritten as the product of this vector."
I'll write it in green.
"The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4, 1 times our input vector, x1, x2, which is super cool because now we just have to do a matrix multiplication."
"Instead of this, and if we have some processor that does this super fast, we can then use that."
"I don't know, I think this is especially elegant, because what happens here is we applied the transformations to each of the columns of a 2-by-2 matrix, and we got a 3-by-2 matrix."
And we know what happens when you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix times a vector that's in R2.
Or you can almost view this as a 2-by-1 matrix.
You're going to get a vector that is in R3.
Because you're going to have these guys times that guy's going to be the first term.
These guys times these guys are going to be the second term.
These guys times those guys are going to be the third term.
"So by kind of creating this 3-by-2 matrix, we have actually created a mapping from R2 to R3."
"Anyway, for some reason I find this to be especially neat."
"Hopefully, at least you find this somewhat instructive."
hello dear sports fans
I'm with you again DmitriyXfit
"Well, what I do is I take the transformation of this guy."
"My domain right here is R2, and I produce a vector that's going to be in Rn."
"So what I do is, let's see."
So I'm concerned with multiplying things times vectors in R2.
"So what we're going to do is we're going to start with the identity matrix, identity 2 because that's my domain and it just looks like this:"
"1, 0, 0, 1."
I'm just going to start with that.
"And all I do is I apply my transformation to each of the columns, each of my standard bases."
These are the standard bases for R2.
"I showed you that they're bases, how do I know that they're standard?"
Why are they called the standard bases?
"And I haven't covered this in a lot of detail right yet, but you could take the dot product of any of these guys with any of the other guys, and you'll see that they're all orthogonal to each other."
"The dot product of any one of these columns with the other is always zero, so that's a nice clue."
"And they all have length of 1, so that's a nice reason why they're called the standard bases."
"But anyway, back to our attempt to represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
"So we say look, our domain is in R2, so let's start with I2, or we could call it our 2-by-2 identity matrix."
And let's apply the transformation to each of its column vectors where each of its column vectors are a vector in the standard basis for R2.
So I'm going to write it like this.
"The first column is T of this column, and then the second column is going to be T of 0, 1."
And I know I'm getting messier with my handwriting.
"What is T of the vector 1, 0?"
"Well, we just go here."
We construct another vector.
So we get 1 plus 3 times 0 is 1.
"Then we get 5 times 0 minus 1, so that's minus 1. x2 is zero in this case."
"And then we get 4 times 1 plus 0, so that's just 4."
"So that's T of 1, 0."
"And then what is T of 0, 1?"
"T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3."
Then we have 0 minus 1 is minus 1.
Let me make sure I did this one right.
What was this?
You can get some on the Ave.
"You know? for those of you who are far away from the Ave, I don't know where you can get incense, but we've got lots here."
"Maybe we can ship some to you, 'kay?"
"And then you can meditate upon this, okay?"
"But I'll just tell you that's your matrix A. And then, what we're going to do, is do exactly what we did in class last time."
"Remember this matrix a, it's 500 rows, 5000 columns, so it's, it's a big matrix with highly under determined, okay?"
"Oh by the way, well lets go back to that."
"Now once you get that, then, here you go."
This is exactly what we did in class last time.
"We're going to solve this, highly underdetermined system, in three ways."
We're going to use the pseudo inverse Command.
"We're going to say okay, find the suit [UNKNOWN] over in the first of this matrix a."
Multiply it by your sample signal.
"Get a v-, get the vector x out, okay?"
"We're also going to say, alright, how about just use the backslash."
Backslash solves large and indetermined systems.
"There it is, we'll call that X2 and then, here you go."
"Here's the optimization routine, and I've given you a link that you can download this."
It's a
little add-on in that .
It's just a generic convex optimization solver.
"What you're going to do is, Is the following."
"There's some variable x3 that's going to be our solution, and you want to minimize, so what you want to do, is you want to find the minimum l1 solution of this under determine system, so here it is."
"Minimize the norm x3, within one norm."
"There's the one norm right there, right?"
The l1 norm.
"Subject to x = b, right?"
So there's infinite number of solutions.
"Give me the one that satisfies the solution, but also has the smallest l1 norm."
That's what y ou're saying to do.
"And you know, from what we did last time."
"First thing is probably going to do, is say, hey, you know what?"
"We'll check that return equals, equals null, just like it did."
"In fact, it looks a lot like the stack, actually."
And here I'm going to show you something kind of funny.
If I go take my stack CCPs pop.
"So if you remember what pop did over here, is it took the front most cell off the"
list.
And in the case of the queue that was the popping operation.
And it turns out the D queue operation is exactly the same.
"If we're empty, right, then we want to raise there."
"Otherwise, we take the head's value."
"We move around the head, we delete the old memory."
So it's not actually the top element.
"I should, actually, be a little bit more careful about my copying and pasting here."
I could really call that front.
It's the front-most element on the top.
But it's like the exact same mechanics work to take a cell off the front in that way.
"Well, that's sort of nice."
"And it's like, yeah, well, since I have some code around I want to go try it."
"My stack, also, kind of does some things useful in push that I might be able to use."
"It's not exactly the same because it's adding it to the front, but it is setting up a new cell."
So I'm going to make a new cell and I set its value.
"Then, it's attaching"
looks a little different.
Let's take a look.
"We omitted a cell, copied the value in, now the goal is giving our pointer to the tail, we want to attach onto the tail."
"So we know that it's always going to have a next of null, the new cell."
"So no matter what, it will be the new last cell and it defiantly needs that value that tells us we're at the end of the list."
And then we have to attach it to our tail.
I'm going to write this code first and it's going to be wrong.
So just go along with me in this case.
If the tail's next is the new cell.
"So if I'm wiring in the pointer from the tail onto the cell we have there, and then we want to update the tail to point to the cell."
But it turns out that this is not quite the same expected value as this.
But you don't have to worry about it for now.
So why even talk about the standard deviation?
"Well, one, the units work out a little better."
"If let's say all of our data points were measured in meters, right?"
If we were taking a bunch of measurements of length then the units of the variance would be meter squared. right?
Because we're taking meters minus meters.
This would be a meter.
Then you're squaring.
You're getting meters squared.
And that's kind of a strange concept if you say you know the average dispersion from the center is in meter squares.
"Well first, when you take the square root of it you get this-- you get something that's again in meters."
"So you're kind of saying, oh well the standard deviation is x or y meters."
And then we'll learn a little bit it if you can actually model your data as a bell curve or if you assume that your data has a distribution of a bell curve then this tells you some interesting things about where all of the probability of finding someone within one or two standard deviations of the of the mean.
"But anyway, I don't want to go to technical right now."
Let's just calculate a bunch.
Let's calculate.
"Let's see, if I had numbers 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7."
And let's say that this is a population.
So what would its mean be?
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.
6 plus 8 is 14.
14 plus 7 is 21.
So the mean of this population-- you sum up all the data points.
"You get 21 divided by the total number of data points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
21 divided by 5 which is equal to what?
4.2.
Fair enough.
Now we want to figure out the variance.
And we're assuming that this is the entire population.
So the variance of this population is going to be equal to the sum of the squared differences of each of these numbers from 4.2.
"So this is linear, order n and n is this sum of the element, or sorry, the number of elements in each list."
I said I was going to back my way into this.
That gives me a way to merge things.
So here's what merge sort would do.
"Merge sort takes this idea of divide and conquer, and it does the following: it says let's divide the list in half."
There's the divide and conquer.
And let's keep dividing each of those lists in half until we get down to something that's really easy to sort.
What's the simplest thing to sort?
"A list of size one, right?"
So continue until we have singleton lists.
"Once I got a list of size one they're sorted, and then combine them."
Combine them by doing emerge the sub-lists.
"And again, you see that flavor."
"I'm going to just keep dividing it up until I get something really easy, and then I'm going to combine."
"And this is different than binary search now, the combine is going to have to do some work."
"So, I'm giving you a piece of code that does this, and I'm going to come back to it in the second, but it's up there."
But what I'd like to do is to try you sort sort of a little simulation of how this would work.
"And I was going to originally make the TAs come up here and do it, but I don't have enough t a's to do a full merge sort."
"So I'm hoping, so I also have these really high-tech props."
I spent tons and tons of department money on them as you can see.
I hope you can see this because I'm going to try and simulate what a merge sort does.
"I've got eight things I want to sort here, and those initially start out here at top level."
The first step is divide them in half.
All right?
"I'm not sure how to mark it here, remember I need to come back there."
I'm not yet done.
What do I do?
Divide them in half again.
"You know, if I had like shells and peas here I could make some more money."
What do I do?
I divide them in half one more time.
"Let me cluster them because really what I have, sorry, separate them out."

It is an illustration of ""nearly all stages in a speciation process"" (Dobzhansky). Richard Highton argued that ""Ensatina"" is a case of multiple species and not a continuum of one species."

Fixed-gear bicycle
"A fixed-gear bicycle (also called a ""fixie"") is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism (allowing pedals to stay still while moving)."
It is a dangerous bike to use in towns. This type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world.
"Fixed-gear bicycles are very light. They are built without any unnecessary gadgets, such as chain rings or freewheel hub. When a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle, he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike."
"Most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill. Fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel. That means that the rider cannot stop pedaling. When the rear wheel turns, the pedals turn in the same direction. This allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals, so that the mechanism will not rotate."
"It also makes it possible to ride backwards, although learning to do so is much more difficult than riding forwards."

In 2009, the park had around 17.2 million visitors, making it the most visited theme park in the world."
"The symbol of Magic Kingdom is Cinderella Castle. That castle is based on the castle in the movie ""Cinderella""."
Transportation and Ticket Center.
"The Transportation and Ticket Center, also called the TTC, is the first place park guests enter after the parking lot. At the TTC, guests can buy tickets to enter the park. After that, they can board either a boat or the Monorail, which will take them to the park. Walt Disney built the resort to have a big lake between the parking lot and the park so guests would have a magical experience watching the park come slowly into view."
Areas.
"Magic Kingdom is divided into six areas. Most of them are called ""lands"". The lands are Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. The other areas are Main Street, U.S.A. and Liberty Square."
"Main Street, U.S.A.."
"Main Sreet, U.S.A. is the first area guests enter after going through the gates. It was built to look like a typical street in the United States. The buildings use forced perspective to make the street look longer than it really is and Cinderella Castle look taller. That means the buildings closer to the viewer are taller than the buildings farther away."
The street is lined with shops and restaurants. The windows of the buildings have the names of people who worked for the Walt Disney Company on them.
Adventureland.
"Adventureland is themed around exploring unknown lands, like jungles and islands. Rides and shows in this area are the Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management), the Jungle Cruise, and Pirates of the Caribbean, among others."
Frontierland.
"Frontierland is based on the American West in the 1800s, also called the Wild West. Rides and shows in this area include Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, and the Country Bear Jamboree."
Liberty Square.
Liberty Square is based on colonial America around the time of the American Revolution. Rides and shows in this area include the Hall of the Presidents and the Haunted Mansion.

Archaeothyris
"Archaeothyris was the earliest definite synapsid. It lived in the late Carboniferous period, 306 million years ago."
"It was found in Nova Scotia, at the same locality as ""Hylonomus"", and ""Petrolacosaurus"", which are similar to ""Archaeothyris"", but probably sauropsids."
"""Protoclepsydrops"" is slightly older, but its status as a synapsid is unclear as the remains are more fragmentary."
Systematics.
"""Archaeothyris"" belonged to a group of early pelycosaurs that evolved early in the Pennsylvanian. It is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids (which include mammals)."

Article Seven of the United States Constitution
"Article Seven of the United States Constitution explains what needs to happen for the Constitution to be approved. It says that nine states need to ratify the Constitution before it takes effect. To ratify the Constitution, a special group in each state called a Convention would have to approve the Constitution."
Text.
"In Simple English, this means: The approval of nine states' Conventions will be enough to make this Constitution official in those states."
Background.
"Before the United States Constitution was passed, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. These Articles made the United States into a confederation. The legislature of the confederation government was called the Congress of the Confederation."
"After a few years, the Founding Fathers decided the United States needed a new constitution and a new form of government. They formed a group called the Constitutional Convention to write a new constitution. The group finished its final version of the Constitution on September 17, 1787. Three days later, the Convention gave its suggested Constitution to the Congress of the Confederation to get its support."
"The Congress debated a lot about the Constitution. Members of Congress did not agree on whether Congress should support the new Constitution or not. On September 28, the Congress came to a compromise. They decided just to give the states the Constitution and let them vote on it. Congress would not suggest that the states pass the Constitution, or that they not pass it. This way, the decision would truly be up to the states; no state would be affected by Congress's opinion."
Approval.
"In 1787 and 1788, there were debates across the United States about the suggested new Constitution. Each state's Convention would have to vote on the Constitution. For a state to ratify the Constitution, more than half of the members of its Convention would have to vote for the Constitution."

Homology (mathematics)
"In mathematics, homology is a certain procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules with a mathematical object, such as a topological space or a group. The word homology has the Ancient Greek root ""homos"", which means ""identical""."
"For a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces."
"The original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their ""holes"". Since a ""hole"" is defined by something that is ""not there"", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape. As it turns out, there are some kinds of holes that homology cannot ""see"" — in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed."

Thrace

It was bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. Thrace included areas which are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey. The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people. They lived in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe."
Ancient history.
The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the Persian Empire.
"The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity."
"Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD, in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence."
"The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and ""Thrace"" and ""Thracians"" are simply the names given them by the Greeks."

Boris Pasternak
"Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (30 May 1960) was a Russian poet, novelist, and literary translator. His parents were Jewish Ukrainians. In his native Russia, Pasternak's anthology ""My Sister, Life"", is one of the most influential collections ever published in the Russian language. Furthermore, Pasternak's translations of plays by Goethe, Schiller and Shakespeare are deeply popular with Russian audiences."
"Outside Russia, Pasternak is best known as the author of ""Doctor Zhivago"", a novel which takes place between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Second World War. Due to its independent minded stance on the socialist state, ""Doctor Zhivago"" was refused publication in the USSR. The typescript of ""Doctor Zhivago"" was smuggled out of the country to Milan and published in 1957."
"Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the following year, an event which humiliated and enraged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the midst of a massive campaign against him by the CPSU and the Union of Soviet Writers, Pasternak reluctantly agreed to decline the prize. In his letter to the Nobel Committee, Pasternak stated the reaction of the Soviet State was the only reason for his decision. He is still listed as the winner for that year."
"By the time of his death from lung cancer in 1960, the campaign against Pasternak had damaged the international credibility of the U.S.S.R. He is still a major figure in Russian literature. Furthermore, the samizdat methods were later continued, expanded, and refined by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and other Soviet dissidents."

Jaguar Racing
Jaguar Racing was a Formula One team which raced from 2000 to 2004. It comes from Stewart Grand Prix. Ford bought the team in June 1999 and was to be renamed to Jaguar Racing to promote their Jaguar brand.
"For their first season in 2000, the team hired former Stewart GP driver Johnny Herbert and the 1999 Championship runner-up (second place) Eddie Irvine. However, the team only finished in the points twice during the season. In 2001, Herbert was replaced by Luciano Burti, who was replaced four races in the season by Pedro de la Rosa. Although the team got double the amount of points finishes in 2001, including a podium (top three) in Monaco, this did not help the fact that the team did not have the same success as Stewart GP got in 1999."
"In 2002 the team got worse, with three points finishes (but a podium in Italy), and a lot of financial (money) issues. Cutbacks were announced for the 2003 season, which included money savings, and a layoff (mass sackings of employees). In 2003, with a improved points system which allowed eight drivers to finish in the points, Jaguar Racing benefitted from this as they finished in the points eight times, with drivers Mark Webber, Antônio Pizzonia, and Justin Wilson replacing Pizzonia for the last five races. 2004 was to be the last season for Jaguar, keeping Webber, and hiring Christian Klien for the whole season. Five points finishes would follow, though financial difficulties would result in the team being bought out by Red Bull, then the team was renamed to Red Bull Racing."

Krip-Hop is a movement that draws attention to hip-hop artists with disabilities. Leroy Moore's Krip Hop Nation has released two mix tape CDs. The 'Krip' in Krip Hop is short for 'cripple'. The word is used by some disabled people to describe themselves. Moore chose to change the 'c' in 'crip' to a 'k' because there is a gang called the Crips. Krip Hop Nation performed at the Happening Weekend at DaDaFest 2010.
Musicians.
Krip-Hop musicians include Miss Money and Kalyn Heffernan. Heffernan has brittle bone disease. She is the frontwoman of a group called Wheelchair Sports Camp.

Numerical integration
"Numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral. Numerical integration has also been called quadrature. Very often, it is not possible to solve integration analytically, for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurements, or when the antiderivative is not known, and it is difficult, impractical or impossible to find it. In such cases, the integral can be written as a mathematical function defined over the interval in question, plus a function giving the error."
One way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation. Very often these interpolating functions are polynomials.
"Various formulas have been studied for many years and become famous. For example, there is the Gaussian quadrature (named after Gauss), the Newton-Cotes formula (named after Isaac Newton), and the Euler-Maclaurin formula (named after Leonhard Euler)."
Numerical errors.
"Numerical errors can occur in any kind of numerical computation including numerical integration. Errors in numerical integration are considered in another area called ""validated numerics""."

Madame de Lafayette
"Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, countess of La Fayette (or Lafayette) was a French writer. She is commonly known as Madame de Lafayette. She was born on 18 March 1634 in Paris, and died there, on 26 May 1693. In 1678, she published the novel ""La Princesse de Clèves"" (the Princess of Clèves). This book is regarded as one of the first psychological novels."
Adrienne de La Fayette
"""Marie Adrienne"" Françoise de Noailles, madame de La Fayette (2 November 1759 – 24 December 1807). She was born in Paris at the family home, the Hôtel de Noailles. Known as ""Mademoiselle d'Ayen-""she was the second daughter of the duc d'Ayen, a powerful French noble-prior to her marriage to Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette, in the chapel of the Hôtel de Noailles on April 11, 1774. The couple lived there for the first few years of their marriage. They had four children."
Lake Torrens National Park
"Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia, 345 km north of Adelaide. The park protects the area around Lake Torrens, which is a large, dry, salt lake covering an area of 5,700 square kilometres. The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf. Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years."
"The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds, including 150,000 Banded Stilts. This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years. The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000. During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood."
History.
The first European to find Lake Torrens was Edward John Eyre in 1839. For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe-shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges. This salt lake blocked any path to the interior. The first European to get through this barrier was A. C. Gregory from the north in March 1858.
"Later in 1858, an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north-west also crossed the non-existent barrier near modern Marree. Eyre's horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes; Lake Frome, Lake Callabonna, Lake Blanche, Lake Gregory, Lake Eyre South, and Lake Torrens itself."
Hominin
"Hominini is the tribe of african apes that comprises humans (""Homo""), and all ancestors of ""Homo sapiens"" back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ""Sahelanthropus"" as a key fossil."
"A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the genus ""Pan"" (the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). In this case, the subtribe Hominina is the ""human"" branch, including genus ""Homo"" and its close relatives, but not ""Pan"". All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species."
Genera.
Subtribe Panina
Subtribe Hominina
Hominina
"Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus ""Homo""."
"If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:"
"If used, the group includes ""Sahelanthropus"" six to eight million years ago."
Taxonomy.
"Even today, the genus ""Homo"" has not been properly defined."
"Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define ""Homo"" when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of Neanderthals brought the first addition."
"The genus ""Homo"" was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human."
"Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times."
"Classifying a fossil as ""Homo"" means evidence of:"
"Port Lincoln, South Australia"
Port Lincoln is a city in South Australia. It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.
History.
"The first people to live in the area were the Barngarla (Parnkalla) people, who are Indigenous Australian people. The name they used to call this area was Galinyala."
European people settled in the area in 1836.
"British Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it ""Port"" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from."
Fresh water.
"Port Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water."
Demographics.
"About 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population."
Geography.
"Port Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline."
Government.
Port Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.
Economy.
"The economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna."
"Port Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community."
Tourism.
"Tourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings."
"Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance."
Transport.
Port Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.
There is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic. The export of iron ore through Port Lincoln has been approved by the South Australian Government. (c. Oct 2009)
Port Lincoln Airport is located a few kilometers north of the city. Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.
Culture.
"The book ""Blue Fin"" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of ""Jaws"" and Anzac Cove scenes in ""Gallipoli"", were also filmed near Port Lincoln."
"""Australian Survivor"", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, ""Survivor"", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001."
"""Hearts Apart"" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln."
"Port Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque ""Moshulu"", which anchored off Boston Island. ""Moshulu"" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though ""Moshulu"" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. ""Moshulu"" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo."
"During the 1939 season, ""Passat"" and ""Lawhill"" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book ""The Last Grain Race"" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, ""Learning the Ropes""."
Media.
"After 1869, the northern Japanese island was known as Hokkaido. Regional subdivisions were established. Nemuro Province was one of the new entities which were created in 1869."
"In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan including Nemuro Province were reformed in the 1870s."
"In 1882, Nemuro and the other ten provinces of Hokkaido were reorganized as Hakodate Prefecture, Sapporo Prefecture and Nemuro Prefecture."

Diamonds and Toads
"""Diamonds and Toads"" () is a fairy tale by Charles Perrault. It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 called ""Contes de ma mêre l'oye"" (). The volume was intended for the king's niece, and included four other tales by Perrault. It was first published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in ""Histoires ou contes du temps passé"" (), a collection of eight prose fairy tales by Perrault. ""Le Doie Pizzelle"" () is a similar tale in Giambattista Basile's ""Pentamerone"" (1550-53). Other versions of Perrault's tale exist, including one collected in Hesse by the Brothers Grimm. Iona and Peter Opie write, ""The theme of this tale is one of the most popular in the world, that of the proud and the privileged being brought low, and the meek and down-trodden being raised above them."" Christopher Betts believes the tale was intended for a young audience, ""old enough to appreciate that the unkind sister is 'rude' ... but not enough to object to the scarcely disguised nannyish advice."""
Story.
"A widow has two daughters. The elder is ugly, selfish and rude. The younger is beautiful, kind and polite. The younger is sent to fetch water from a spring. An old woman dressed in rags (a fairy in disguise) asks for a drink of water. The girl politely gives her one. In thanks, the fairy causes diamonds and roses to drop from the girl's mouth whenever she speaks. At home, her mother is amazed. She sends her elder daughter to the spring. The girl meets a grandly-dressed lady (the fairy) who asks for a drink of water. The girl responds rudely. The fairy causes snakes and toads to drop from her mouth. At home, her mother is furious. She blames the younger sister. The girl runs into the woods. She meets a prince who falls in love and marries her. The elder sister dies after running away from home. A rhyming moral tells the reader that politeness and gentle words are worth more than jewels. They may bring unexpected rewards."

Onomatopoeia
An onomatopoeia is a word that sounds like the sound it means: words that imitate particular sounds.
Examples:
Glenn Miller
"Alton Glenn Miller (March 1, 1904 – missing in action December 15, 1944) was an American big band musician, arranger, composer, and bandleader in the swing era. He was the best-selling recording artist from 1939 to 1943, leading one of the best known big bands. Miller's notable recordings include ""In the Mood"", ""Moonlight Serenade"", ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"", ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"", ""A String of Pearls"", ""At Last"", ""(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo"", ""American Patrol"", ""Tuxedo Junction"", ""Elmer's Tune"", and ""Little Brown Jug"". During World War II, he led bands in the U.S. Army. While he was traveling in France during World War II, Glenn Miller's airplane disappeared over the English Channel."
Early life and career.
"Miller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (née Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played ""dance band music"". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician."
"In 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed ""Moonlight Serenade"". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, ""Room 1411"", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook."
"In the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs ""Annie's Cousin Fannie"", ""Dese Dem Dose"", ""Harlem Chapel Chimes"", and ""Tomorrow's Another Day"" in 1934 and 1935. In 1935, he started an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble. In this band, he featured a lead clarinet over four saxophones. He later used this arrangement in his own bands."
"Glenn Miller formed his first band in 1937. The band broke up after playing its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 2, 1938."
Success from 1938 to 1942.
"Miller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a ""sound"" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands."
"Miller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams."
Bluebird Records and Glen Island Casino.
"In September 1938, the Miller band began making recordings for Bluebird Records. Cy Shribman, a prominent East Coast businessman, began financing the band. In the spring of 1939, the band played at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey and at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. At Glen Island, 1800 people attended Afterwards, the band became much more popular. The band's recording ""Tuxedo Junction"" sold 115,000 copies in the first week."
"On February 10, 1942, Miller received a gold record for ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"". ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"" was performed by the Miller orchestra with his singers Gordon ""Tex"" Beneke, Paula Kelly and the vocal group, the Modernaires. Other singers with this orchestra included Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle, Kay Starr, Ernie Caceres, Dorothy Claire and Jack Lathrop."
Motion pictures.
"Miller and his band appeared in two films. The first one was ""Sun Valley Serenade"" (1941) The second was ""Orchestra Wives"" (1942)."
Army Air Force Band: 1942–1944.
"In 1942, Miller decided to join the war effort because he was too old to be drafted. At first, he volunteered for the Navy but was told he was not needed. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He asked to lead an army band so he could entertain the Allied Forces, and was accepted this time. He earned the rank of captain and he was soon promoted to major by August 1944."
"He was placed in the United States Army at first, but was then moved to the Army Air Forces. Captain Glenn Miller served as an officer at the training center at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1942. He played trombone with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece dance band, both on the base and in the town."

"An EF3 tornado destroyed much of the area where the tornado dropped down. Along with the tornado there were strong winds and 1/4 to 1/2"" in diameter hail"
New Jersey.
Severe thunderstorms impacted the state. the severe thunderstorms produced 1/10 to 1/4 inch in diameter hail and strong winds. Tornadoes were unlikely but possible.
Maryland.
A possible tornado did some damage to an area where the tornado possibly dropped down. Otherwise hail and wind were a problem.
Snow and sleet.
"Snow fell acros much of New York State to even NYC and Northern New Jersey. New York City and Northern New Jersey just saw a few snowflakes and sleet flakes, while places north of NYC saw heavy sleet, and New York State saw a general 1-2"" of snow. Some places saw as much as 4-5"" of snow."

"Over the Limit was a professional wrestling event that was held yearly by WWE, and aired live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The first one was held in 2010, taking the place of Judgment Day in the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The last event took place on May 20, 2012 at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was replaced by WWE Battleground in 2013."
"As is the case with most lower level PPV's made by WWE, the event was held only in arenas in the United States. Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower level title matches on the undercard and the top level featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigns its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which cause matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show."
Osamu Tezuka
"Osamu Tezuka (, Tezuka Osamu, November 3, 1928 – February 9, 1989) was a famous Japanese cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer and Doctor of Medicine, although he never practiced medicine. He was born in Osaka Prefecture. He created ""Astro Boy"", ""Kimba the White Lion"" and ""Black Jack"". He is often credited as the ""Father of Anime"", and is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who was a major inspiration for Tezuka."
"Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including the children mangas Astro Boy, Princess Knight and Kimba the White Lion, and the adult oriented series Black Jack, Phoenix, and Buddha, all of which won several awards."
"Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released."
Delft
"Delft is a city in the province South Holland in the Netherlands. It is about halfway between Rotterdam and The Hague. It is famous for its Delft Blue pottery and the Delft University of Technology. It is the place where the royal family, the kings and queens, are buried. It has about 94,000 inhabitants."
Things to see.
"Delft is a city with typical Dutch canals, churches and large canal houses. The largest church in Delft is the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church)."
Deventer
"Deventer is a municipality and city in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. About 101,000 people were living there in 2021. It lies both in Salland and IJsselvallei regions, alongside the eastern bank of the IJssel river."
Deventer was founded by Lebuinus around 768. He built a wooden church there.
"A Catholic community called the Brethren of the Common Life was founded by priest Geert Groote in this city late 14th century. This community was connected with a Catholic reform movement called the Devotio Moderna, which was largely based on Groote and founded the same time."
"Deventer is well known for its cake, the so-called ""Deventer Koek""."
Ede
"Ede is a city in the Netherlands with 65,000 inhabitants, the communal district (gemeente) of Ede has 107,000 inhabitants."
Freud Museum
"The Freud Museum was the home of Sigmund Freud and his family after they escaped the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938. It is at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead, London."
"After the death of Anna Freud, the youngest daughter, in 1982, the home became a museum. The centrepiece of the museum is Freud's study, preserved just as it was during his lifetime."
"There are two other Freud Museums, one in Vienna, and another in Příbor, the Czech Republic, in the house where Freud was born."
The study.
"The study and library were preserved by Anna Freud after her father's death. The bookshelf behind Freud's desk contains some of his favourite authors: not only Goethe and Shakespeare but also Heine, Multatuli and Anatole France. Freud acknowledged that poets and philosophers had gained insights into the unconscious which psychoanalysis sought to explain systematically."
"The room contains the original analytic couch brought from Berggasse 19. On this patients would recline comfortably while Freud, out of sight in the green tub chair, listened to their 'free association'. They were asked to say everything that came to mind without consciously sifting or selecting information. This method became a foundation upon which psychoanalysis was built."
Antiquities.
"The study is filled with antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Orient. There are some fine masks and carving from Africa. Freud visited many archaeological sites (though not Egypt). Most of the collection was got from dealers in Vienna."
"He confessed that his passion for collecting was second only to his addiction to cigars. The importance of the collection can be seen in Freud's use of archaeology as a metaphor for psychoanalysis. One example of this is Freud's explanation to a patient that conscious material 'wears away' while what is unconscious is relatively unchanging: ""I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antique objects about my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation""."
The collection includes a portrait of Freud by Salvador Dalí.
Emu
"The emu (""Dromaius novaehollandiae"") is a large flightless bird. It is native to Australia. The emu is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. The emu is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. It should also be noted, as an odd fact, that the Emus won a war against Australia."
Other emus.
There were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived. The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species.
"There were also two species of dwarf emu, ""Dromaius minor"", one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island. They are examples of island dwarfism. The group on King Island became extinct in 1805, that on Kangaroo Island in 1827, and that in Tasmania in 1865."
Brad Renfro
"Brad Renfro (July 25, 1982 — January 15, 2008) was an American actor. He played Mark Sway in ""The Client"" in 1994. He played Huckleberry Finn in the movie ""Tom and Huck"" in 1995 and also appeared in the family drama ""The Cure"" in the same year. He made many feature movies in his career. His career ended because of alcoholism and drugs."
"Renfro was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. He died at age 25 due to heroin intoxication. For reasons unknown, Renfro, was not included in the annual Academy Awards tribute for Hollywood performers who had died during the past year."

Athelwald of Deira
"Athelwald (also spelled Oethelwald or Œthelwald) was a King of Deira. He was the nephew of King Oswiu of Northumbria, his overlord, but he turned on his family to support the pagan Penda of Mercia. When Penda was killed, Athelwald lost his kingdom."
Early Career.
"He was the son of King Oswald of Northumbria, who was killed by Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Maserfield in 642. At Oswald's death Northumbria was reduced back to the two kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswiu was the king of Bernicia and was acknowledge as overlord of Deira."
Penda had placed Oswine of Deira on the throne of Deira. But Oswine did not get along with his overlord Oswiu. He raised an army against Oswiu but then realized his army wasn't large enough and he sent them home. He was betrayed by one of his nobleman to Oswiu and was murdered in 651.
King of Deira.
"After Oswine's death, Athelwald became king. It is uncertain whether Oswiu (who was Athelwald's uncle) installed him as king or whether Athelwald took the kingship in opposition to Oswiu. At some point he allied himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda of Mercia. He guided Penda during his invasion of Northumbria in 655. But, when the armies of Oswiu and Penda met on 15 November at the Battle of the Winwaed, Athelwald withdrew to safety. Penda was defeated and killed. perhaps in part because of this desertion, and afterward Athelwald was not heard of again."
King Athelwald gave St. Cedd the lands of Lastingham to build a monastery.
Department
Department can mean several things:
Polar vortex
"The polar vortex (alternate names: Arctic cyclone or polar vortice) is a persistent large-scale cyclone located near geographical poles of a planet. On Earth, a polar vortex is usually in the middle and upper troposphere and stratosphere. The cyclone surrounds the polar highs. Polar storms lie in the wake of the polar front. They strengthen in the winter and weaken near summer. These vortexes span usually between 620 to 1,240 miles. They circulate counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere."
"Similar to hurricanes, a Coriolis effect causes the rotation of a polar vortex. The Arctic vortex has two main centers: one is over the Baffin Island, the other is over northeastern Siberia."
Climate change may be increasing Arctic polar vortex stretching events. This would cause more extreme cold in the United States.
Department of Alto Adige
"The Department of Alto Adige (, ) was a department of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy. It was named after the river Adige (Etsch), which flowed through it. The capital of the department was Trento."
"The department's territory was not the same as that of the modern Italian province of Alto Adige. Some of the territory is the same, such as the city of Bolzano, but most of the rest is now part of the province of Trento. These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol."
History.
"The name ""Alto Adige"" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the ""Department of Alto Adige"" (""Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige""), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named ""Haut Adige"" to get rid of relation to the historic ""County of Tyrol"" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic."
"Some years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians."
The Brittas Empire
The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.
Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.
The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes — including two Christmas specials — from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.
"""The Brittas Empire"" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's ""Britain's Best Sitcom"" poll."
"The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in ""The Brittas Empire""."
Plot summary.
"Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives."
"Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent."
"Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss."
Episodes.
"""The Brittas Empire"" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called ""Get Fit with Brittas""."
"For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank."
"However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent."
"'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre."
"In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix."
DVD and VHS releases.
"All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s."
Critical response.
Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that:
"In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, ""The Brittas Empire"" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch."
Influence.
"The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and ""The Office""."
Setting.
"The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire."
Teen Titans Go!
"Teen Titans Go! is an American television show. It airs on Cartoon Network. It first aired on April 23, 2013. It is currently airing ""its 8th season."""
"The production companies of the series are DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, with the animation outsourced to first and second seasons of United States at Digital eMation, AKOM and Rough Draft Korea in traditionaly animation and the third season onwards of Canada at Copernicus Studios and Bardel Entertainment in flash animation."
List of The Brittas Empire episodes
"Jacqueline Onassis returned to the United States after her second husband died. She lived in Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port. In 1975, she became an editor at Viking Press. She worked there for two years."
"Jacqueline Onassis went to the 1976 Democratic National Convention. This was her first political event in almost ten years. She quit Viking Press in 1977. This was after Viking had published Jeffrey Archer's novel ""Shall We Tell the President?"". The story happens in a fictional future presidency of her brother in-law, Ted Kennedy. The book was about a plan to assassinate him. Two years later, she went to Boston to support Ted Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign."
"After she left Viking Press, Onassis worked for Doubleday. She was an associate editor. Some of the books she edited for the company were Larry Gonick's ""The Cartoon History of the Universe"", the English translation of Naghib Mahfuz's ""Cairo Trilogy"", and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland."
"In the 1970s, she supported a campaign to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition and repair it. A plaque inside the terminal talks about her role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she supported protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have created large shadows on Central Park. She also supported saving Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in New York."
"Jacqueline Onassis had a lot of press attention. Paparazzi photographer Ron Galella followed her around and took pictures of her without her permission. From 1980 until her death in May 1994, Onassis had a close relationship with businessman Maurice Tempelsman."
"In the early 1990s, Jacqueline Onassis supported Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton for president. She donated money to his presidential campaign. After the 1992 presidential election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton. They talked about raising a child in the White House. Mrs. Clinton later said that Jacqueline Onassis was an inspiration for her."
Illness and Death.
"In November 1993, Jacqueline Onassis was thrown from her horse while she was fox hunting in Middleburg, Virginia. She was taken to the hospital. Doctors found a swollen lymph node in her groin. They thought it was an infection at first. The fall made her health worse over the next six months. In December, Onassis had new symptoms such as stomach pain and swollen lymph nodes in her neck. She had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She began chemotherapy in January 1994. By March, the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain. By May, it had spread to her liver. Her condition was terminal."
"Jacqueline made her last trip back home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The next day on May 19, she died in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment, aged 64. Her two children were by her side. Her son John F. Kennedy, Jr. announced her death the next day. He said that she died with her family around her."
"On May 23, 1994, her funeral was held and was short and small. Fewer than 100 people were at the 11 minute long funeral. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, next to her husband President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton spoke at her graveside service. At the time of her death, her children Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., her three grandchildren, Rose, Tatiana and John Schlossberg, and sister Lee Radziwill were her living relatives. Her estate was worth $43.7 million."
Honors.
"In 1994, the Municipal Art Society of New York started the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal. It is given to a person whose work has greatly helped New York City. The White House's East Garden was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden soon after her husband died. The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School for International Careers was opened in 1995. The main reservoir in Central Park was renamed in her honor."
Legacy.
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as one of the most popular first ladies. She was named 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century. This was more often than any president of the United States listed. In 2014, she came in third place in a Siena College Institute survey as the best first lady. She was behind Eleanor Roosevelt and Abigail Adams in the survey."
"In 2020, ""Time"" magazine included her name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was named Woman of the Year 1962 for her White House restoration works."
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is seen as an important first lady in United States history. Many historians feel that First Ladies since Kennedy Onassis have either been compared to or against her.

Hurricane Earl (2010)
"Hurricane Earl was an intense and long-lived hurricane that was also the first such storm to threaten New England since Hurricane Bob nineteen years earlier. The storm's center passed eighty six miles east of North Carolina on September 3, 2010. The storm then moved northeast, eventually being downgraded to tropical storm status and then becoming a hurricane again shortly before the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia. Before lashing the eastern United States, the hurricane passed extremely close to the Leeward Islands; the damage there totaled $40 million (2010 USD)."

Characteristics.
Selenography is the study of the physical features of the Moon.
Sorption
"When two chemical substances come in contact with each other, through what is called a phase, they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an interface. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption, if the same process happens on the interface, it is called adsorption. In the year 1909, James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption."
"Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment; using sorption it is possible to bind pollutants to small particles in the air (called aerosols), or in the soil (where they bind to colloids). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances."
Machines and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning.

Scientists intended Phobos-Grunt to orbit and study Mars. It was meant to look at Mars' atmosphere and dust storms, plasma and radiation. Then, Phobos-Grunt should have landed on Phobos and returned a 200 g soil sample to Earth."
"The spacecraft was the first Russian interplanetary mission since Mars 96. It was launched on 8 November 2011 (UTC), aboard a Zenit rocket, at Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was sent with the Chinese spacecraft Yinghuo-1 and with the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment."

Materials science
Materials science studies the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems. It uses applied physics and chemistry. Supersmall nanotechnology has got attention in recent years. There are many inventions of new material. Work on why structures fail or break down is very important to engineering.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Nintoku.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Irukandji jellyfish
"The Irukandji Jellyfish, ""Carukia barnesi"", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true."
"The Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:"
"Sometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure."
"The Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish."
"The Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, ""Chironex Fleckeri"". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital."
"Irukandji has stingers – not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity was born in Townsville, Queensland."
Emperor Yūryaku
"was the 21st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Yūryaku to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Yūryaku""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.

He was the brother of Emperor Ankō.
"Yūryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei."
Events of Yūryaku's life.

"After Ankō's death, Yūryaku overcame others in the struggle for power. He became the new emperor."
Yūryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.
"Poems that are said to be Yūryaku's are included in the ""Manyōshū"". A number of his verses are kept in the ""Kojiki"" and the ""Nihonshoki."""

After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Yūryaku.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Kia Carens

"On 2 February 2017, Malaysia applied to the ICJ pursuant to Article 61 of the Statute of the ICJ for the revision of the 2008 judgment on the basis of three documents it had obtained from The National Archives of the UK between August 2016 and January 2017. The documents were internal correspondence of Singapore's colonial government in 1958, an incident report submitted by a British naval officer in the same year, and a 1960s map of naval operations bearing annotations. The Malaysian Government said that these documents indicated that ""officials at the highest levels in the British colonial and Singaporean administration appreciated that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh did not form part of Singapore’s sovereign territory"" during the relevant period."
Rosa García Ascot
"Rosa García Ascot (8 April 1902, Madrid – 2 May 2002, Torrelaguna, Madrid) was a Spanish composer and pianist. She was the only woman in the well known Group of Eight. The other members were Julián Bautista, Ernesto Halffter and his brother Rodolfo, Juan José Mantecón, Fernando Remacha, Salvador Bacarisse and Jesús Bal y Gay. She married Bal y Gay in 1933. Her more notable compositions include ""Suite para orquesta (Suite for orchestra)"", ""Preludio (Prelude)"", and the ""Concierto para piano y orquesta (Concerto for piano and orchestra)""."
"García Ascot is also considered Manuel de Falla's last disciple. Before studying with de Falla in Madrid, she was a studied with Felipe Pedrell and then later with Enrique Granados. She spent 10 years in the early part of her career touring as a concert soloist. After this, she did very few public concerts and always in very special circumstances. She died almost a month after her 100th birthday."
John Carver
"John Carver ( 1584 1621) Carver was a passenger on the ""Mayflower"". He was a leader during the ""Mayflower"" voyage and signed the Mayflower Compact. He was also the first Governor of Plymouth Colony."
It is believed that Carver was from Doncaster in Yorkshire England. Carver was a Separatist who did not believe in the teachings of the Church of England.
"Carver and his first wife Mary were members of the French Walloon church in Leiden, Netherlands. Their religion was also not allowed where they lived. ""Mayflower"" passenger Francis Cooke and his wife were also members of the French church in Leiden. So was Philip Delano. Delano would arrive in Plymouth in 1621 on the ship ""Fortune"". Carver was a deacon in Leiden about 1609 at about age 25, and was born sometime before 1584. Leiden church records show that Carver lost his first wife Mary and their child in 1609"
"Carver then married Katherine White. She was a member of the Separatist church and was originally from Nottinghamshire. Carver became very involved in the Leiden church. He made close friendships with the leaders of the church, especially the pastor John Robinson. He also became friends with Robert Cushman who would play an important part in the plans for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"The church members decided to travel to Virginia Colony, a place where they would be allowed to practice their religion."
William Brewster was in hiding from King James I. John Carver and Robert Cushman were chosen to make plans for the voyage. In 1617 Carver and Robert Cushman began talking to officials of the Virginia Company.
"These were London businessmen interested in making a profit from the New World. By June 1620, John Carver was in Southampton purchasing supplies for the ""Mayflower"" voyage, along with Christopher Martin. They agreed to pay for the ""Mayflower"" voyage."
"Carver was very rich and provided much of his money to the church members, and for the Mayflower voyage."
Voyage.
"The ""Mayflower"" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"Carver was very educated and was fair with everyone so the passengers chose him to be their leader on the ""Mayflower"". When they landed the people chose him to be their first governor."
In Plymouth Colony.
"Carver left the ship and went to the land to find a safe place where they all could live. William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty also went. Hopkins was very helpful. He had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. On one trip Bradford said they set off in below freezing weather. Many of the men were ill, and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats. They saw Native Americans. They were cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men coming toward them, the Indians ran. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians."
Carver worked very hard with the other men to build houses to keep the people warm. He hunted and fished and helped to plant food.
"During that time, a Native American called Samoset paid a visit to Plymouth Colony and then the chief Massasoit also arrived. Governor Carver worked out a peace treaty with them. On March 23, 1621, John Carver was again chosen to be Plymouth governor. The people said that John Carver was a man they well approved of."
"In early April 1621, after working in the field on a hot day, Governor Carver complained of a pain in his head. He returned to his house to lie down. Within a few days he died. William Bradford stated that Carver, although a wealthy man had worked hard alongside everyone."
"Thomas Weston was one of the men who helped to pay for the Pilgrims trip. He had criticism of the pilgrims for not loading up the returning ""Mayflower"" with furs and other goods to pay them back. Govenor William Bradford sent a letter telling them of all the troubles they had. He blamed Thomas Weston, and stated that Governor John Carver ""had worked himself to death that spring and the loss of him and other industrious men lives cannot be valued at any price""."
"Carver is buried at Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymoth, Massachusetts."
Gulbarga district
Gulbarga () is a district of the Indian state of Karnataka.
Beed district
"Beed district (Urdu: ضلع بد) is a district of Maharashtra, India."
"Something untrue is false. A half truth is something true mixed with something false, or something partly true with key information omitted."
"If the things one says are true, then they are speaking the truth, or speaking truly. Saying something that is untrue can be called a lie, if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue. A person who says something untrue is often called a ""liar""."
True and false in logic and philosophy.
"""True"" is also one of the two basic values of logic. The other such value is usually called ""false"". In symbols, ""true"" is written as, T or 1."
Aristotle was the first to put logic into a formal framework. His version is called propositional logic (see also syllogism and deductive reasoning). Other forms of logic use types of mathematics (mathematical logic) or symbols. Boolean algebra is about things being true and false.
The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by epistemology and the philosophy of science.
Philosophers argue over what makes up truth and how to define and identify truth.
Zimbabwe
The Republic of Zimbabwe is a country in the southern part of the continent of Africa. Its capital city is Harare.
Geography.
"Zimbabwe is surrounded by other countries, and so it has no coast on the sea. This type of country is called ""landlocked"". The countries that surround Zimbabwe are Zambia, Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique."
"Zimbabwe is home to the famous waterfall, Victoria Falls, which are a feature of the river Zambezi and also the Great Zimbabwe, the ancient architectural monument from which the country was named after."
Vegetation (Fauna and Flora).
"The country is mostly savanna. In the east it is moist and mountainous with tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees include teak and mahogany, knobthorn, msasa and baobab. Among the many flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya."
"There are around 350 species of mammals in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species."
History.
"The area that is now Zimbabwe was added to the British Empire around 1890. Zimbabwe is also known by its old name of Rhodesia. In 1965, it became an independent country when Prime Minister Ian Smith announced the Unilateral Declaration of Independence(U.D.I). The government was mostly controlled by the white population, similar to South Africa at the time. African citizens were given full equality in 1980, and the country's name was officially changed to Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe led the country as the Prime Minister and President for 37 years. Though Mugabe was elected fairly at first, he became a dictator, and had put in place a number of cruel and disastrous laws. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned as President of Zimbabwe."
Language.
"The country Zimbabwe has a mixture of languages; Shona, Ndebele, Venda, Manyika, Nyanja, Chagani, and a unique-unified Zimbabwean English."
Economy.
"Zimbabwe uses the currencies of several other countries. The government uses the United States dollar. The economy is currently in a bad situation. Foreign currency reserves are at very low levels, and the Zimbabwean Dollar has become very devalued. Just recently, three zeroes were taken off the Zimbabwean dollar (for example, $1,000,000 (one million dollars) would become $1000 (one thousand dollars)). Many observers link this to Mugabe's controversial Land Reform programme."
2017 coup d'état.
"On November 15, 2017, President Robert Mugabe was placed under house arrest as Zimbabwe's military took control in a coup. On November 21, 2017, Mugabe resigned the Presidency."
Provinces.
Zimbabwe is divided into 8 provinces and 2 cities that are the same as a province.
Cities.
The largest cities are:
Sports.
Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe. Rugby union and cricket are also popular. Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals.
Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games. Kirsty Coventry won 11 gold medals in swimming.
"Zimbabwe has also been at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, netball, and water polo, as well as squash, motorsport, martial arts, chess, cycling, polocrosse, kayaking and horse racing. Most of these sports don't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level."

Reuben
Reuben was the son of Jacob and Leah in the Book of Genesis.
Birth.
"Jacob was in love with Rachel, the daughter of Laban and asked to marry her. Laban said he would let Jacob marry her if he worked for him as a shepherd for seven years. Jacob worked for those years but they felt like they were only seven days because of how much he loved Rachel. But then, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Rachel’s older sister Leah instead of marrying her and said he didn’t believe in the younger daughter marrying before her older sister married so Jacob had to work for Laban for another seven years so that Laban would let him marry Rachel. Jacob loved Rachel but he did not love Leah so Leah prayed to the Lord saying “give me children, for I am despised”. So the Lord had mercy on her and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And Leah said “now my husband shall love me” and named her son Reuben."
Mandrakes.
"After Leah gave birth to Simeon, Levi and Judah (Biblical personage), Bilhah gave birth to Gad and Asher, Zilpah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali and Leah gave birth to Zebulun and Issachar, then Reuben found mandrakes and gave them to his mother Leah. When Rachel asked Leah for the mandrakes,Leah said “first you take from me my husband and now the mandrakes of my son” and agreed to give Rachel the mandrakes if Leah became Jacob’s main wife."
Bilhah.
It’s written in the Torah that Reuben lay down with Bilhah and that his father Jacob heard about it. (Genesis 35:22) Though the Talmud says that this was a metaphor and that Reuben actually took Bilhah’s bed from his father’s tent but that this was seen as being like the sin of incest (Shabbat 55) and says that this works because in the Book of Job wanting to commit incest is seen as committing incest.
The story of Joseph.
"In the story of Joseph, when the brothers are about to kill Joseph, Reuben tells them that instead of murdering him they should throw him into a big hole in the ground and leave him to die. But Reuben secretly planned to rescue Joseph and so when Reuben came back to save Joseph and found out that he had already been sold into slavery, Reuben tore his clothes in mourning for Joseph. And after Simeon was jailed, Reuben told his brothers that the Lord was punishing them all for what they did to Joseph."
Inheritance.
"According to Jewish tradition, Reuben didn’t get the inheritance that a firstborn son would usually get because he was being punished for the sin with Bilhah."
Talmud.
"Rabbi Shimon son of Eliezer teaches that after Leah died and Jacob moved his bed to the tent of Bilhah, Reuben took the bed from Bilhah’s tent and put in the tent of his mother Leah to honour his mother’s memory and the sin Reuben committed by doing that was compared to incest but Reuben did not actually have sex with Bilhah. Though there are also Rabbis in the Talmud who say that he did."
The Zohar.
"According to the Zohar, Reuben lying down with Bilhah cannot be wikt:literally true because then Reuben wouldn’t have become the father of a tribe of the Israelites. It says that Reuben knew from prophecy that there were supposed to be only twelve tribes of Israel so he moved his father’s bed from Bilhah’s tent even though the Shechina is there whenever married people do their religious duty to have sex with each other but by meddling Reuben made the Shechina leave that tent and that was Reuben’s sin."
Affenpinscher
"The Affenpinscher is a small breed of dog in the toy group. These dogs originally came from Germany. They are known to have existed since the 1600s. Their name comes from the German word ""Affe,"" which means ""monkey,"" because their faces remind people of monkeys. Originally, the dog was bred to be a ""ratter,"" a type of dog that kills rats and mice in homes, farms, and stables. Now that mice are not so commonly found in the home, Affenpinschers are usually just kept as pets."
Appearance.
"The Affenpinscher is a very small kind of dog. It weighs between . Its height is between at the shoulder. Their face is flat and ""monkey-like."" The most common and preferred colour of fur for this breed is black, but they can also come in grey, beige, and other colours. In the American Kennel Club, a good example of these dogs could be any colour. In the French and British Kennel Clubs they must only be black."
Coast
The coast is where land meets the sea.
"The coast also means the land next to the sea, which can also be called the shore, or sea-shore. However, coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land - it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land."
"If a house is near to the coast we say it is ""on the coast"". When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it ""the coast-line""."
"Sometimes, 'coast' can be part of a place name or the description of a large area. For instance, the East Coast of the United States describes the all of the Eastern side of the United States that is next to the Atlantic Ocean."
In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast.
Coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants.
An example of a coast in Great Britain is the Holderness Coast near Bridlington. This is one of Europe's fast eroding coasts.
George Harrison
"George Harold Harrison, MBE (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. After the group broke up in 1970, he had a solo career. He made many albums and worked with other musicians including Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Phil Spector, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Ravi Shankar. He was also interested in Eastern mysticism and charitable causes."
Early life.
"Harrison was born in 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, He was youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison and Louise Harrison, He had one sister and two brothers."
Solo music.
"George's best-known album was ""All Things Must Pass,"" which he made just after the Beatles broke up. Harrison owned a mansion in England called Friar Park, where he lived from 1970 until he died. He built his own recording studio inside the mansion, which for a time was better than Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles had made their records. Having a private studio meant Harrison could work on songs and recordings anytime he wanted."
"Ravi Shankar came to Harrison during 1971 with news about a war in Bangladesh, where thousands of people had died and millions more were refugees and starving. Shankar asked for Harrison's help to give a benefit show to buy food for them. Harrison called on many of his musician friends, who put together a charity concert with famous people to help the refugees. The ""Concert for Bangla Desh"", a live recording, became a best-selling album, raised money for the refugees, and brought worldwide attention to the problems in their country. It also inspired later benefits, including Live Aid in the 1980s."
"Harrison found a new musical partner in the 1980s, when Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra began to write and record songs with him. The two men worked well together and became close friends. Harrison and Lynne formed another band, the Traveling Wilburys, with fellow musicians Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison. The Traveling Wilburys recorded two albums, which became hits."
Personal life.
"In 1966, Harrison married a model, Pattie Boyd, but they were divorced in 1971, and had no children. Boyd left Harrison to be with his friend, guitarist Eric Clapton, but all three remained friends. Harrison married again in 1978, to American-born Olivia Trinidad Arias, who had worked for his record company. Arias became the mother of Harrison's son Dhani, whose name is comprised of the names of two notes in the Indian music scale. Dhani grew up to be a musician like his father, fronting the band thenewno2. He went to Brown University in the United States."
"In the late 1970s Harrison formed a movie production company, Handmade Films, which produced movies including Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"" and Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits""."
"The grounds of Harrison's home, Friar Park, had been more or less open to the public, until the murder of his former bandmate John Lennon late in 1980. Harrison was very hurt and shocked by Lennon's death, and was afraid someone might try to harm him or his family. Afterwards, the gates were locked, and no-entry notices were posted. In December, 1999, an intruder broke into his home, stabbing him with a knife. Harrison and his wife Olivia stopped the intruder and called the police. Harrison recovered. The man who attacked him is schizophrenic and was acquitted of attempted murder by reason of insanity in November 2000 at Oxford Crown Court. He was sent to a mental hospital and released in 2002."
Death.
"In the 1990s, decades of smoking cigarettes caused Harrison to develop throat cancer. He later developed lung cancer, which caused his death in 2001. His family issued a last statement from him: ""Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another."" Even music was not as important to Harrison as his wanting people to learn to get along with each other, and to make the world a better place."
"A year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison, the two remaining Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr), and other musicians held the ""Concert for George"", which remembered Harrison's music, his life, and his gifts to humanity. All the profits from the concert were given to charity."
Note (disambiguation)
Note has several meanings.
Ravi Shankar
"Ravi Shankar (7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012) was one of India's most famous musicians.

Atmosphere of Mars
"The atmosphere of Mars is the layer of gases surrounding Mars. It is mainly made up of carbon dioxide. The average atmospheric pressure of the Martian surface (6.0 mbar) is much lower than that of the Earth (1,013 mbar). The pressure is well below the Armstrong limit, meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 98.6 °F (36.6 °C)."
"The Martian atmosphere contains 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen, carbon monoxide, water and methane, and so on. Ever since the discovery of methane in 2003, scientists say that this might indicate life. It has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes, volcanic or hydrothermal activity."
"The atmosphere of Mars is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface. Data from NASA pointed out that the dust particles are 1.5 micrometres diameter."
"On 18 March 2015, NASA found an aurora that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the atmosphere of Mars."
"Liquid water on Mars was once commonplace, which means the atmosphere was thicker. Many studies have found that the atmosphere of Mars has been weakened over time due to solar winds. On Earth, the magnetic field protects us from most of the wind. Mars used to have a magnetic field, but cooling of the core has resulted in the magnetic field being lost."
Solar Wind Composition Experiment
"The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWC) was an experiment that took place on the Moon during the Apollo program (Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16). It was done to measure the solar wind outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It was the first notable measurement of isotopic solar material."
The experiment was suggested by by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss of the University of Bern and Peter Eberhardt of the Swiss Institute of Technology. It was partially funded by the Swiss Government.
"The SWC experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun. The foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface. After the experiment, the sheet was placed into a Teflon bag, and sent back to Earth to be studied. The experiment was successful and found Helium, Neon and Argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun."
Caesar's Comet
"Caesar's Comet (C/-43 K1) is also known as 'Comet Caesar' and the 'Great Comet of 44 BC'. It was one of the most famous comets of ancient times. Many Romans thought the comet's seven-day appearance was a sign of the deification of recently assassinated dictator, Julius Caesar (100–44 BC)."
"Caesar's Comet was one of only five comets known to have had a negative absolute magnitude and may have been the brightest daylight comet in history. It was not periodic, and it had a parabolic orbit. The comet might now be more than 800 AU from the Sun."

"The height up to the shoulder of the male is 175 to 195 cm. When the female is 165 to 185 cm. Has the same height. Length from head to body is 240 to 300 cm. And length 70 to 105 cm. Have. The flowering of horns, which are relatively short cylindrical and have a small roundness on the inside, is about 85 to 100 cm. Mating at any time of the year. New chicks are found especially during the months of November to March. Its gestation period is about 270 days."
The pregnant female is separated from her group. Gives birth to a baby and keeps the baby moving around. The female takes constant care of him. Babies start walking a few minutes after birth. The female and cub reunite after being separated from their group for a few days.
"The species is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. Population trends are stable in well-protected areas, and are building up in a few areas which had been neglected."
The gaur is the tallest species of wild cattle.
"The Malayan gaur is called ""seladang"", and the Burmese gaur is called ""pyoung""."
"The domesticated form of the gaur ""Bos frontalis"" is called 'gayal' or 'mithun'."
Seed fern
The term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes).
The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata. They flourished during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.
Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous. Some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania.
History of the term.
The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century. Palaeobotanists saw that many Carboniferous fossils which looked like ferns had anatomical features like cycads.
"British palaeobotanists made the discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants."
"Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads. In the English-speaking world they were referred to as ""seed ferns"" or ""pteridosperms"". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading. The names have nevertheless stuck."
"Later during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as ""Glossopteris"" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept."
"The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a number of clades, so many palaeobotanists today regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'."
"Does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites)."
"This is useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them"" pteridosperms"" with no suggestion of their being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras."
John Riggins
"Robert John Riggins (born August 4, 1949 in Seneca, Kansas) is a retired American football running back who used to play for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins of the NFL. He was nicknamed ""The Diesel"". He won Super Bowl XVII with the Washington Redskins where he was also the MVP and is a member of the Redskins Ring of Fame. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992."
Glossopteris
Glossopteris is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct seed ferns. They were typical plants of the coal forests or coal swamps which lasted from the Pennsylvanian (later Carboniferous) to the end of the Permian.

After they were promoted at the end of the 2007–08 season, they began playing in the Conference National. The club spent over fifty years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972, and have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football. Barrow have twice won non-league football's highest cup competition, the FA Trophy - in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only non-league club to have won the trophy at both old and new Wembley stadia."
"The club colours are blue and white. The combination of these has varied over time. It has led to their nickname ""The Bluebirds"". Attendances at the club's Holker Street field vary - the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954. But during the 1990s and 2000s, the average remained between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 1,590 during the 2008-09 season."
The club won their second FA Trophy title on the 8th May 2010 after beating Stevenage Borough 2-1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.
District 9
"District 9 is a 2009 science fiction thriller movie directed by Neill Blomkamp. It was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham.

"The plot is based on a 2005 short movie, ""Alive in Joburg"", also directed by Blomkamp and produced by Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen, pivots on the themes of xenophobia and social segregation. The title and plot of ""District 9"" were based on real-life events that took happened in District Six, Cape Town during the apartheid era. The movie was produced for $30 million and shot on location in Chiawelo, Soweto, showing fictional interviews, new stories, and videos from surveillance cameras in a part-mock documentary style format.

Notes
Eyre Coote (British Army officer)
Eyre Coote (20 May 1762 – 10 December 1823) was a British soldier and politician who was born in Ireland.
He was known as General Sir Eyre Coote until 1816; GCB 1815 - 1816.
Background.
"He was the second son of the Very Rev. Charles Coote (1713 - 12 February 1776), DD, Dean of Kilfenora. After studying at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, Coote bought a commission in the 34th Regiment of Foot - of which his uncle was colonel - in 1774."
"He was soon sent to North America to fight in the Revolutionary War. He fought in the Brooklyn in August 1776, as well as at Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth Court House before finally being taken prisoner at the final Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Between 1790 and 1798, he represented Ballynakill in the Irish House of Commons. Then he sat for Maryborough until 1800."
"He served in England and Ireland when they were threatened by French invasion and against the French on the Continent. He went on to serve in Holland, Egypt and eventually became Governor-General of Jamaica (1806–1808) where he possibly sired an ancestor of Colin Powell."
Scandal and death.
"Sir Eyre was removed from the service on the 21 May 1816 because of the scandal he caused in the Christ's Hospital school for boys. On 25 November 1815 he entered the school and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them. After that he asked them to flog him and gave them money. He was caught by the school nurse, and charged with indecent conduct before the Lord Mayor of London. He was acquitted after giving £1000 to the school: after that there was a military inquiry in April 1816 which stripped him of his rank and honours. He was appointed GCB 1815 and stripped of it 1816."
Pilum
A pilum was a type of spear. It was used by the Roman army. Pila were generally 2 metres long. They were made up of a wooden shaft and an soft iron point.
Tree frog
Tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees.
"There are several lines of Neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs. These groups are only distantly related, but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions. The result is that now there are species from different groups which look very much like each other. This is convergent evolution. It goes so far that in almost all cases, where one group occurs, another does not. Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of the groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared."
"The frogs do not normally come down to the ground, except to mate and spawn. Some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees as adults. In some species the eggs develop directly into adults; in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf."
"Many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage. Others are poisonous (poison dart frog), and display warning colouration."
"The logo of Wikipedia, which is a free, open-source online encyclopedia, that's accessible in many languages, is a picture that shows the following description:"

Proteome
"Proteome is a word made from the words protein and genome. It means all the proteins produced by an organism. It was suggested in 1994 by Marc Wilkins, Professor of Biotechnology at the University of New South Wales."
University of New South Wales
"The University of New South Wales (UNSW) is a university in Sydney, New South Wales. It is one of the most highly regarded schools in Australia. It was founded in 1949."
The Alphabet Killer
"The Alphabet Killer is a 2008 American mystery crime thriller movie. It was given limited release on November 7, 2008. The movie is about the murders of three girls in Rochester, New York between 1971 and 1973. Eliza Dushku plays Megan Paige, an investigator for Rochester Police Department who is investigating the murders. Timothy Hutton plays killer Richard Ledge. This thriller got negative reviews from the critics."
Crop (anatomy)
"A crop (sometimes called a croup or craw) is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary canal used for storing food before digestion. It is found in many animals. It occurs in birds, some dinosaurs, and invertebrate animals such as gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, leeches, and insects."
Birds.
"In a bird's digestive system, the crop is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. It is a part of the digestive tract, essentially an enlarged part of the oesophagus. As with most other organisms that have a crop, the crop is used to temporarily store food. Not all birds have a crop. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds."
"Scavenging birds, such as vultures, will gorge themselves when prey is abundant, causing their crop to bulge. They subsequently sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food."
"Most raptors, including hawks, eagles and vultures (as stated above), have a crop; however, owls do not."
Bees.
"Cropping is used by bees to temporarily store nectar of flowers. When bees ""suck"" nectar, it is stored in their crops."
Difference to gizzard.
"In a gizzard, the food is ground down before digestion, usually by stones. Gizzards have a tougher lining, and muscles. The gizzard is lower down the digestive tract, and more like a part of the stomach."
"The crop is just a storage device. Often, it pays a bird to feed while the going is good, and do the digestion later. In many birds and in bees, the food is eventually brought back to the nest and given to family members."
"In other species, food brought back to the nest is pre-digested. That would mean it is regurgitated (brought up) from the stomach."
Dassault Rafale
The Dassault Rafale is a fighter aircraft made by French airplane company Dassault Aviation. The prototype first flew in 1986 but was introduced in 2001 by the Marine Nationale. Rafale was introduced in Armée de l'Air in 2006.

Abortion laws
"Abortion laws specify under what circumstances a woman can get an abortion. Getting an abortion means that the pregnancy is ended early, without the birth of a child. These laws vary widely, by country, and sometimes by area. They have also changed over time."
"As of 2022, about 60% of the people live in a country that allows abortion, under some circumstances. When abortion is legal, it may mean that only part of the reasons are recognized, or that it is only legal for part of the pregnany."
Options for regulation.
"Generally, there are the following options, from the most liberal, to the most restrictive, when a pregancy can be ended:"
Common reasons for allowing an abortion:
Discussions about abortion.
"Abortion is a controversial subject in many societies: People argue in favor or arganist it, using argumrnts from religion, moral and ethical values, or practical or political reasons. Note that legally outlawing abortions will not stop people from getting an abortion: They may get an unsafe abortion, which is riskier than a legal abortion. A study done in 2007 found that abortion rates were similar in countries where abortion was legal, and those countries where it wasn't. Very often, people get an abortion, because they do not have easy access to modern contraceptives. According to the same study, the number of abortions is decreasing, because contraceptives are more commonly available."
Timeline.
"The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of July 2022, 65 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request."
"Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included (e.g., leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States). Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved."
Johann Adolf Hasse
"Johann Adolf Hasse (also spelled Johann Adolph Hasse; baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was a German composer, singer, and music teacher. He was an important opera composer in the 18th century."
Life.
Early career.
"Hasse was born in Bergedorf, near Hamburg. His father and grandfather were organists. He studied in Hamburg from 1714 to 1717. In 1718 he joined the Hamburg State Opera. He was a tenor singer. In 1719, he started working in Brunswick. He performed operas written by Georg Schürmann, Francesco Conti and Antonio Caldara. His own opera, ""Antioco"", was performed in Brunswick in 1721. It is his only opera which is written in the German language."
"He might have left Germany in 1722. He went to Naples. In Naples, he converted (changed his religion) to Catholicism. He studied writing music and counterpoint with Alessandro Scarlatti. Hasse's first opera in Italy was ""Il Sesotrate"". It was performed on 13 May 1726. The opera was a success. It made him a famous composer and musician."
Dresden and Venice.
"In 1730 Hasse visited Venice. He married Faustina Bordoni, an opera singer. His opera ""Artaserse"" was performed there. It was his first opera which uses Metastasio's text. The opera was a success."
"He became the ""Kapellmeister"" of the Dresden court in around 1730. He arrived at Dresden in 1731. His employer was King August II of Poland. He wrote operas and church music in Dresden. In Dresden, he wrote the opera ""Cleofide"". The opera uses text by Metastasio. Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach may have watched the opera's first performance. On the next day, Bach performed on the organ. Hasse might have watched Bach play the organ. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach said that his father and Hasse were good friends."
"As part of his job, Hasse did not have to stay in Dresden. From 1733 to 1734 he stayed in Italy. He wrote music for the Ospedale degli Incurabili, an orphanage in Venice. He also went to Vienna. He taught Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria how to sing. Hasse came back to Dresden in December 1733. He wrote new operas. He also wrote some church music. In 1734, the king of Poland went to Warsaw. Hasse went back to Italy. He stayed in Italy until 1737."
"He went back to Dresden in 1740. He wrote the operas ""Antigono"" and ""Ipermestra"". The text for these operas were written by Metastasio. Hasse and Metastasio became good friends. They wrote many operas together."
Black Forest cake
"The Black Forest cake, also called ""Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte"", is an authentic German cake made up of a chocolate layer cake with cherries in the middle and whipped cream on top. They are traditionally made with fresh Morello cherries, poached in a sugar syrup and pitted. It is a variation of the chocolate cake, and sometimes decorated with chocolate curls."
Jeremy Clarkson
"Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English author, broadcaster, journalist, talk show host. He is best known for presenting BBC television show ""Top Gear"" with Richard Hammond and James May. He is also known for controversial remarks."
He also writes columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun.
Clarkson was ranked 49th on Motor Trend Magazine's Power List for 2011. It is a list of the fifty most important figures in the automotive industry.
"On 26 March 2015, while Clarkson was not allowed to be at work, the BBC announced it will not keep paying him after he said cruel things to and attacked a producer."
Syd Ward
Sydney William Ward (5 August 1907 – 31 December 2010) was an Australian-born New Zealand cricketer.
"Ward was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the second longest-lived cricketer, behind England's Jim Hutchinson, who at the time of his death was 103 years and 344 days old."
Hypothermia
"Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than . Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink."
Mild.
"When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop. The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands. They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well."
"Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest."
Moderate (Middle).
"The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking unsteadily. The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere."
Severe.
"Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies."
Rapids
"Rapids are found on rivers. Rapids are formed by one or more of the following: constriction, obstruction, gradient, and flow rate. For instance, when water is flowing swiftly over a rocky river bed, rapids can be formed. Rapids are typically found in or near the mountains, due to the element of gradient. Formally, the word ""rapids"" is always plural, (like ""scissors"" and ""trousers""), but is often used in the singular when speaking of a specific rapid or when it would be grammatically awkward; e.g., ""Sweet's Falls Rapids vs. Sweet's Falls Rapid). The word ""rapid"" means ""very fast."""
"Because of the splash made by the water going over rocks, rapids are also called ""whitewater"". Some people enjoying whitewater canoeing or whitewater rafting as a sport."
Waray language
"Wáray-Wáray or Warai (commonly spelled as ""Waray""; also ""Winaray"" or ""Lineyte-Samarnon"") is a language spoken in the provinces of Samar, Leyte, and Biliran in the Philippines."
"The Waraynon group of languages consists of Waray, Waray Sorsogon and Masbate Sorsogon. All the Warayan languages belong to the Visayan language family and are related to Cebuano and more closely to Hiligaynon and Masbatenyo."
Usage.
"Waray-Waray is one of the ten officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines and used in the local government. It is spoken throughout the islands especially in the Eastern Visayas region. But it is also spoken in some parts of Mindanao, Masbate, Sorsogon and Metro Manila where Warays went to. There is also a very small number of Filipinos abroad, especially in the United States, that speaks this language."
Number of people in prison.
"As of 2006, there are currently nine million people in prison in the world. The United States currently has the most people in prison; it has more than 2 million people in prison. In 2002, both Russia and China also had over 1 million people in prison. In 2003, the United Kingdom had 73,000 people in prison; France and Germany had a similar number of people in prison."
Cultural references to prisons and prison life.
"There are many books and poems about prisons or prison life, such as ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas, père and ""The Ballad of Reading Gaol"" by Oscar Wilde."
"There are also movies that depict prison life, including:"
"There have also been television programs, such as """" (1979–1986), ""Prison Break"" (2005–2009), Lockup (2005 - present) and (2006 - present), as well as Locked Up Abroad. A current TV show about a women's prison is Orange Is the New Black."
Mexico
"Mexico (; official name: United Mexican States , ) is a country in North America. Mexico is south of Texas, California and other American states. Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico."
"People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak Spanish. There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages, like Nahuatl, Mayan, and Zapotec. Most modern Mexicans are descended from Native Americans such as Aztecs and Mayans and mostly have native blood. They are Catholic. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City."
History.
"Before the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the Olmec culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatán peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec god is Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Moctezuma II."
"In 1519 the Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain."
"In 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide. He set up the First Mexican Empire and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic."
"A man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio López de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a dictator, Texas declared independence (1836). The Battle of the Alamo was part of this Texas Revolution. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States. In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the southwestern United States. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela."
"Between 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Juárez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After more war he was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again."
"Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio Díaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Díaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the Mexican Revolution in 1910."
"The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down."
"In 1929 President Plutarco Elías Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president Lázaro Cárdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940."
"After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas."
"Mainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years."
Politics.
Mexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Parliament has a Senate and House of Deputies.
Geography.
"Mexico is in the southern part of North America. It is roughly shaped like a triangle. Mexico is more than 3000 km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East. Mexico has two large peninsulas. Baja California in the northwest, and Yucatán in the southeast. In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocatépetl and the Iztaccíhuatl. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are deserts. In the south are tropical rainforests. Some rivers in Mexico are the Río Bravo (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the Río Balsas, the Río Pánuco, and the Río Yaqui."
People.
"Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is also the second most populous country in Latin America (after Brazil). 60% of Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers (mostly Native American); these are called mestizos. Almost 30% of Mexicans are pure Native American and 10% are European. Most Mexicans (90%) speak Spanish. 10% of the Mexicans speak a Native American language, like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Maya or Zapotec. Non-indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico speak another foreign language such as Arabic or Japanese. Most people in Mexico are Catholic (89%) Christians."
Atlantic Ocean
The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean. It covers a total area of about . It covers about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology.
Geologic history.
"The Atlantic formed when the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Africa. This began sometime in the Cretaceous period, roughly 135 million years ago. It was part of the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea."
"You is a second-person English pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person. Sometimes, just using the English letter ""u"" is acceptable, and ""ur"" for the words ""you're"" and ""your"". This is very informal, and is mostly used in texting."

Chinese language
The Chinese language is the group of languages used by Chinese people in China and elsewhere. It forms part of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
"Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being Mandarin, Wu, Yue and Min. These are not mutually intelligible and many of the regional varieties are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages."
"'Chinese' can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use the same writing system. Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing. Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the Soviet Union, using one official language so people can understand each other. The Standard Chinese language is referred to as Mandarin in English, ""Pǔtōnghuà"" or ""common to everybody speech"" in mainland China and ""Guóyǔ"" or ""language of the whole country"" in Taiwan. All official documents in Pinyin are written in Mandarin and Mandarin is taught all over China. It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries."
"Chinese is used by the Han people in China and other ethnic groups in China who are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Many people in autonomous regions of China speak other languages. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. They also give ""some"" indication of pronunciation, but the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese. Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, people in places far from each other say them differently, just as ""1, 2, 3"" can be read differently in different languages."
"Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu Pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters."
All the Chinese languages (or dialects) use tones. This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear.
Different languages or dialects of Chinese.
"The Chinese language is like a big tree. The base of the tree started thousands of years ago. It now has several main limbs. Some people call ""just a branch"" what other people call a main limb, so you can say there are six or seven main limbs. Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain, the United States, Australia, India, and so forth. Just as the Romance languages all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin, the Chinese languages all have some common source, so they keep many common things among them."
Here are the main seven main groups of languages/dialects of Chinese by size:
Traditional and simplified characters.
"In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. The Japanese language uses them even more often. These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji."
"A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. However, people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper—but they will have to guess some less-used words."
Examples.
"Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it."
"The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters."
"Before 1956, Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters. At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all. The government of the People's Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand. They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write. Today, many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters."
Zero
"Zero (0) is a special number. If there are zero things, then there is nothing at all. For example, if a person has zero hats, that means they do not have any hats."
Symbol.
"The symbol for the number zero is ""0"". It is the additive identity of common numbers. This means that if a number is added to 0, then that number would remain unchanged."
Math with zero.
3 + 0 = 3
3 − 0 = 3
0 − 3 = −3
Bubble tea
"Bubble tea, also called pearl tea or Boba, is a drink which comes from Taichung, Taiwan. It is made by mixing black tea with non-dairy creamer or milk and adding round ""pearl"" tapioca. There are many flavors other than the original one. Green tea can be used instead of black tea. Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca."
"When it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA."
Bubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.
Things that are in bubble tea.
"Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. Ice-mixed versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy softness. There are many varieties of the drink with a huge range of ingredients like coconut or mango. The two most popular types are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca."
The reason for choosing tapioca.
"At first, people made bubble tea without tapioca pearls. But Taiwanese people started to find substances to make the sweetened flavor. Tapioca came from the cassava plant, which is a root of the trees from South America. This plant is now farmed and enjoyed around the world."
Effects on the body from bubble tea.
"Four positive nutrients that tapioca provide are carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds. These include a very low level of fat, cholesterol, and sodium . It is also known as the source of fiber, “good” cholesterol, and protein. But bubble tea has Cyanogen that are transformed in humans and animals after the plant tissue has been weakened. The blood remains oxygenated after it passes through your body and back to the lungs."
Process to make bubble tea.
"Bubble tea is found in Taiwanese restaurants and commonly prepared by shaking ice, milk, tea, and sugar in a cocktail shaker which resulted in a lot of tapioca bubbles. People use the same preparation to make bubble tea, just now with the added Pearls."
An Jung-sik
"An Jung-sik (1861–1919) was an artist who lived in the late Joseon dynasty. In 1918 he organized the association of paintings and writings artists (Seohwa-hyeopae; 서화협회;書畵協會)'. And he founded ""Gyeongmokdang"" () in which artists and supporters gathered and communicated with each other. As the leader of the association he made an effort to educate younger artist generation. He was excellent at landscape, portrait, flowers and birds."
His main works are:
"In his period, the western modern art was introduced to Korea, and the Korean traditional art was declining. He not only tried to succeed the traditional art but also adapt the western art, a realistic trend."
Korean International School of Hong Kong
"The Korean International School of Hong Kong (KIS) was founded on March 1988. It is in Lei King Wan, Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong, near Tai Koo Shing. Tai Koo Shing has many Koreans."
Structure.
The school has an English section and a Korean section. The Korean Section uses Korean textbooks. The students there prepare to take the KSAT (Suneung) so they can go to Korean universities. The English section uses English textbooks and follows the Cambridge International Primary Programme.
"KIS has many facilities, like a tennis court, swimming pool, soft-surface playing fields, and a gymnasium. Students use the facilities for physical education classes and activities outside of classes. Higher grade students take a school trip to England."
"There are many special parties during the year. Usually there is one party per month. Some of these parties are Play Day in April, Sports Day in May, Spring Concert in June, Halloween in October, and Fun Tie and Hat Day."
"The students are in four ""house teams""- Cougars, Eagles, Lions and Pandas. Each house has their own chant and their own colour."
Investigation.
In the past the school has had problems with bribery. A person in the cleaning company paid a bribe to a school officer. So the Independent Commission Against Corruption investigated the school and arrested one person. Koreans in Hong Kong were disappointed. They said they lost confidence in the school's management.

After he won against the opponent middelweight champion Roman Karmazin, he fought against Sebastian Sylvester, who defended the International Boxing Federation title. Geale won the fight and combined the International Boxing Federation title and the World Boxing Association title after a fight against Felix Sturm. After that, he defended his title against Anthony Mundine, who had beaten him in 2009. He is the reigning Champion of the World Boxing Association (WBA) and the International Boxing Federation (IBF)."
Empress of Japan
"Japanese empresses or Empress of Japan means a . The term also mean the wife of the Emperor, or ."
The wife of Naruhito is Empress Masako. She became the current Empress of Japan when her husband accepted his role as emperor.
Empresses regnant.
"There were eight female monarchs. In other words, there were six female emperors including two who reigned twice."
Empresses consort.
"The wife of an Japanese emperor is called empress in English, but her title in Japanese is a little different."
"""Kōgō"" is the title of a non-reigning empress consort. The title, still in use, is generally conferred on an emperor's wife who had given birth to the heir to the throne. The title was first awarded posthumously in 806 to the late mother of Emperor Heizei."
"""Chūgū"" was a term which evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, ""chūgū"" replaced ""kōgō""; and then the titles became interchangeable."
"The numbers of ""kōgō"" varied, but there was only one ""Chūgū"" at a time."
"The title ""kōtaigō"" was given to the wife of an ex-emperor; and the title ""tai-kōtaigō"" came to be used by a dowager empress."

Throughout their trip, they encounter a variety of different people that sometimes help them, and other times try to hurt them."
"Joel lives with Sarah (his 12 years old daughter) in America. One night, sounds of explosions broke the silence. It seems that a kind of mushroom sick goes to the human body and changes their genetics and make them to ""Wild people eater"". Joel, his brother Tommy, and Sarah want to escape from the city but the city was surrounded by Armed Soldiers and in the middle of the way, Sarah is shot by one of the soldiers and dies in her father's arms."
"20 years later, when many people have died by this disease, the survivors live in a quarantine area. Joel, with his friend Tess, do smuggle in that area but a person named Robert has stolen their weapons."
"After the fights that they do with Robert, Robert tells them that he has gave the weapons to a group called Fireflies. Marlin is the head of this group and promises to Joel and Tess that he will give back their weapons if they give a girl called Ellie to the Fireflies."
Reception.
"The game got great reception, getting over 120 awards and receiving the title of 2013's game of the year. IGN rated the game 10 out of 10, along with many other national game raters, that all rated the game highest any game has ever received. During the first week, the game sold over 3.4 million copies, second only to Grand Theft Auto in sales records ."
"The Last of Us is the most awarded game of all time, winning over 200 game of the year awards.This game has applauded by the critics and took over than 50 complete numbers and the average of the numbers is 95 from 100."
Game Play.
"The Last of Us is a third-person perspective game. The first characters of the game are Joel and Ellie. For most of the game, players control Joel, and Ellie is controlled by the game's Artificial Intelligence. Players also control Ellie and Sarah in a few parts of the game. In this game you can use different guns and other things which you find in the environment like knifes to kill your enemies."
Multiplayer.
"The game includes a multiplayer side, where the player can choose to be a Hunter or a Firefly, with the objective of completing twelve weeks (84 days/games) on each side. It comes with multiple different modes and maps."
Behavior.
"The Horned Viper is nocturnal and terrestrial (lives on the ground), and is usually found buried underneath the sand. They are said to be slow moving, but they are able to do sidewinding. When they do sidewinding they can move faster across the sand. They are able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. They sink into the sand tail first and keep on sinking deeper into the sand until only their eyes and nose are sticking out of the sand. The reason they do this is so they can ambush prey which come close to it. They are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. They live in the deserts of North Africa, Arabia, and Iran."
Feeding.
"The Horned Viper catch their prey by ambushing. They eat mainly rodents, birds and lizards."
Las Vegas culture
"Las Vegas culture is the name for a number of setltements on the coast of present-day Ecuador. These settlements were created between roughly 8000 and 4600 BCE. In total, there are 31 settlements. The people who lived there were hunter-gatherers. They had also started agriculture. Bone points and a spatula have been discovered. They may have been used for making nets or textiles, along with various tools and containers shaped of shell; wood, bamboo, reeds, and bark are also believed to have been used in the tool industry."
No mummies have been found on the coast of Ecuador. The Las Vegas people had similarities with the people whose remains are preserved as the Chinchorro mummies of the north coast of Chile.They also lived at the same time.
Yu Kil-chun
"Yu Kil-chun (, 1856 – 1914) was a Korean politician, philosopher, thinker, reform activist and independence activist during the Joseon Dynasty. His nickname was Gudang, Chunmin, Guyil."
Life.
"Yu Kil-chun was born in Kwangju. In his early years he studied under Park Kyu-su and Oh Kyung-suk. As a young man in 1881, he went to Meiji Japan to study at Keio University. He then went to the United States in 1884 to study mathematics. After his he was accused of supporting the ""Gaehwadang"" (enlightenment party). He was arrested and put in jail from 1885 to 1894."
"Between 1894 and 1895, Yu worked for the government of prime minister Kim Hongjip. He was Vice Minister of State for Home Office. In October 1895, Korea's King Gojong claimed that Yu was involved in the assassination of Queen Min. Kim was killed and his cabinet was disbanded. Yu went to the Russian embassy and escaped the country for exile in Japan. He returned to Korea in 1907 after he was pardoned by Emperor Sunjeong."
"In 1910, when Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan, Yun started a movement against the annexation. Yu was offered the title ""danshaku"" by the Government of Japan, but he refused it. He died in 1914 of a heart problem. He was aged 58."
Plot
Plot may mean:
Katherine Jackson
"Katherine Esther Jackson (born May 4, 1930 as Kattie B. Screws) is the matriarch of the Jackson family of musicians and singers, including Michael Jackson, La Toya and Janet Jackson. She is the widow of Joe Jackson."
"Jackson had 10 children. Several of the children became famous. In 1986 ""Essence"" honored her as ""Mother of the Year""."
"In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, ""My Family"". The book told about her elderly years and her relationship with her husband and their children."
"On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died. Katherine was granted temporary guardianship of Michael's three children. In 2012 her guardianship was suspended for a short time. The guardianship resumed with TJ Jackson, Michael's nephew, added as a co-guardian."
Fax
"Fax (short for facsimile), or telecopying, is the transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device."
"The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which turns the contents (text or images) into a bitmap, Then the bitmap is sent through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image, printing a paper copy."
"Businesses usually have some kind of fax system, but the technology has faced increasing competition from Internet-based methods. Fax machines still retain some advantages, particularly in the transmission of sensitive material which, if sent over the internet, may be intercepted. However, encryption (a secret coding system) can make internet messages secure."
"In some countries, because electronic signatures on contracts are not recognized by law while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business."
"In many businesses, standalone fax machines have been replaced by fax servers which receive and store incoming faxes electronically. The servers route them to users on paper or via a secure email. Such systems reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound phone lines needed by an office."

Alfriston
"Alfriston (pronounced All-friston) is a village and civil parish in the Sussex district of Wealden, England. The village is in the valley of the River Cuckmere, about four miles (6 km) north-east of Seaford and south of the main A27 trunk road and part of the large area of Polegate. Alfriston has a population of 764."
Dipodidae
The Dipodidae are a family of small to medium-sized rodents living in the northern hemisphere. The family has over 50 species in 16 genera.
"They include the jerboas, jumping mice, and birch mice. Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of ""saltation"", which is jumping from a bipedal stance. This feature is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas. Their movement resembles that of kangaroos more than that of true mice."
"Most species are nocturnal, and the eyes and ears are noticeably larger than usual in proportion to the body."
Personal defense weapon
"A personal defense weapon (PDW) is usually defined as a light, compact and easy to use firearm. However the definition varies depending on context and who you ask. Many will still say it is a short-barreled rifle (SBR). These are regulated in the United States by the ATF. Many SBRs have ""selective fire"" (you can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic fire)."
"The United States Department of Homeland Security defines a personal defense weapon as an M4 carbine (or a Colt AR-15 civilian semi-automatic rifle). Some governments' definition of PDWs includes handguns. An example is the Czech Republic. It has proposed a constitutional amendment which would allow its citizens to own and keep PDWs as a way to discourage terrorists. Regardless, a PDW is usually agreed upon as being somewhere between a submachine gun and an assault rifle."
History.
"In the 1980s, the term was used for troops in tight, confined environments. They needed a compact automatic weapon that could defeat body armor. It was designed for troops in tanks, military trucks and those operating from aircraft including pilots. The majority of soldiers do not take part in an infantry battle. Their jobs are usually to support the infantry. Their main role is not winning a fight, but often to escape an ambush. In other situations they may assist the infantry. PDWs are also used by bodyguards as they can be hidden under a jacket but still allowed good firepower. PDWs tend to be shorter range weapons."
"The term evolved as concealed carry became more popular, especially in places like the United States. Certain states in the United States make carrying a firearm for personal defense relatively easy while others make it more difficult. Also, quite a few other countries allow concealed carry, to various degrees. Pistols, especially compact models, are very popular self defense weapons today. Also, there are now a number of pistols available in rifle calibers."
Alternative self-defense weapons.
"In places where a firearm cannot be carried or the person chooses not to carry a firearm, there are other weapons they can carry. Common items such as a credit card, car keys, a pen or even a scarf can be effective self defense weapons. Because of the popularity of self defense, there are also specially designed non-lethal weapons designed not to look like weapons."

Curtis now lives in Florida. He is a superdelegate.
Excise
"An excise or excise tax is an indirect tax charged on certain goods. As an indirect tax, they are charged by the producer or the merchant who then has to pay the government. For the same reason they are also not considered a sales tax. Excise taxes are commonly part of the retail price of a product such as gasoline, alcohol or cigarettes. Excise taxes may be charged by both state and federal governments."
Excise vs sales tax.
"Excise taxes are different from sales tax in two important ways. First, excise is charged only on specific goods. Sales tax can apply to most things a person might buy although certain jurisdictions may exempt food or clothing. Excise taxes are usually applied to luxury goods or products linked to health issues such as tanning salons or cigarettes. Secondly, sales tax is charged as a percentage of the purchase price. An excise tax is usually a fixed amount added to the price. It can be hard to tell how much excise tax a person pays because it is part of the purchase price. Sales tax is added to the price and is usually shown on the receipt."
US excise taxes.
"In the United States, excise taxes make up about 4 percent of all federal revenues. This is lower than many other countries. The Constitution refers to excise tax as an indirect tax. Some states in the United States have different names for excise taxes. For example, in the state of Massachusetts the excise tax charged on automobiles is called an ""ad valorem tax""."
Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on April 8, 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution"
changed the method by which United States Senators were elected. For the first 125 years of the Constitution required US Senators to be elected by the state legislatures. A number of problems in the United States Senate created the need to change how Senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the United States.
Background.
"When the Constitution was adopted in 1788, Senators were to be elected by the state legislatures. This remained in effect for 125 years. By the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure. In addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years, political machines had gained control over state legislatures. This corrupted the process and the Senate was seen as a ""millionaire's club"" who served private interests instead of the people. Beginning in the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed Senators be elected by direct election. The Senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals."
"At this point, many states changed their strategy. Article Five of the United States Constitution offers two methods for amending the Constitution. In addition to the common method of a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, was another method. It stated that if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one, Congress must call a constitutional convention. The method had not been used before. When it appeared two-thirds of the states wanted the change, Congress acted."
"Before and After is a 1996 thriller drama based on a 1992 book of the same name. Meryl Streep plays Doctor Carolyn Ryan, Edward Furlong plays Jacob and Liam Neeson plays Ben Ryan. The subject of this thriller is murder, deception, coverup and betrayal. The release date was February 23, 1996."
"Uozu, Toyama"
"is a city in Toyama Prefecture, Japan."
History.
Uozu developed as a castle town.
"In 1582, the forces of Oda Nobunaga forced the Uesugi clan to give up control of Uozu Castle."
"In 1918, riots started in Uozo because of increases in rice prices."
"In 1956, a great fire ravished many buildings in Uozu."
Geography.
"Several rivers run through Uozu—the Fuse River, the Katakai River, the Kado River, and the Hayatsuki River."
Gold was discovered in the mountains of near Uozu.
Demography.
"According to Japanese census data,"
Lake Mungo remains
"The Lake Mungo remains are three sets of human fossils. They are Lake Mungo 1 (""LM1"", or ""Mungo Lady""), Lake Mungo 2 (""LM2""), and Lake Mungo 3 (""LM3"", or ""Mungo Man""). The sites are located near Lake Mungo, in New South Wales, Australia, in the World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes Region. Pieces of skeletons have been found in this region. These pieces have been attributed to over forty human skeletons. The Lake Mungo remains are the most significant of these."
Mungo Lady (LM1).
"LM1 are the fossilised, cremated remains of a young woman. They were found in 1969 by James Bowler with the University of Melbourne. Radiocarbon dating of pieces of bone from the burial put LM1 between 24,700 and 19,030 years old. Charcoal from a hearth 15 cm above the burial was dated at 26,250 years old (plus or minus 1,120 years). Reconstruction and study of the remains were mainly done by Alan Thorne at the Australian National University. The patterns of burn marks on the bones suggest that the body was first burned, then smashed, then burned a second time, before being buried."
"Research published by Bowler in 2003 rejected previous estimates for all of remains at the site. Optical dating concluded that both LM1 and LM3 were buried around 40,000 years ago (plus or minus 2,000 years). This makes it the earliest evidence of human cremation that has been found. It suggests that ancient indigenous Australians in this region had their own complicated burial rituals."
"The bones were returned in 1992 to the area's traditional owners: the Paakantji (Barkindji), the Mathi Mathi and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park visitor centre."
Mungo Man (LM3).
"LM3 was found by James Bowler on 26 February 1974, when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. It is located 500 m east of the LM1 site. The body was covered with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a complicated and artistic burial practice. Like the cremation of LM1, this indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought."
Description.
"The skeleton was of a slender individual, quite different to the build of modern indigenous Australians. The skeleton was badly preserved: large pieces of the skull were missing, and most of the bones in the limbs were damaged. Usually, the gender of a skeleton is determined using the bones in the skull and the pelvis. The problem is that these bones are in a very bad state in LM3, or they are missing altogether; in other words, the ""normal"" method of gender determination cannot be used with LM3. Since LM3 was discovered, other features were studied; most of these studies agree that LM3 was probably a male."
"LM3 was buried lying on his back, with his hands joined together covering the groin. Some of the bones show evidence of osteoarthritis and eburnation, and the teeth are well worn. Based on this, it is likely that LM3 was quite old (around 50 years old) when he died. New studies show that, using the length of his limb bones, it is possible to estimate LM3's height at 196 centimetres (77 inches or 6 ft 5 in), unusually tall for an Aboriginal."
Age.
"The first estimate of LM3's age was made in 1976 by the team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) who excavated LM3. They estimated that LM3 was between 28,000 and 32,000 years old. They did not test LM3's remains directly; instead, they made their estimate through stratigraphic comparison with LM1. In 1987, an electron spin resonance test was done on pieces of bone from LM3's skeleton. This gave an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999, optical dating work was done on quartz from the LM3 burial site. The results indicated a burial older than 24,600 years (± 2,400) and younger than 43,300 years (± 3,800)."
"Later in the same year, research led by Alan Thorne gave a new estimate of 62,000 years old (plus or minus 6,000 years). This estimate was made by combining data from uranium-thorium dating, electron spin resonance dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the remains and the soil in the grave. This estimate was very controversial, and some of the techniques used to get this estimate were criticised."
"In 2003, several Australian groups came to an agreement that LM3 is about 40,000 years old. A team led by Bowler did 25 more OSL tests that suggested that LM3 can not be older than 50,000 years. This age roughly agrees with stratigraphic evidence using four different dating methods. The age of 40,000 years is now the most widely accepted age for the LM3. This makes it the second oldest human fossil east of India, and the oldest in Australia. In addition to this, the study published in 2003 found that LM1 and LM3 are similar in age, and that humans were present at Lake Mungo as early as 50,000 to 46,000 years ago."
Other discoveries of remains.
"In 1998, the remains of a child were discovered. These are believed to have roughly the same age as Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. In 2005, erosion exposed another adult skeleton. Because it was not protected, this skeleton was destroyed by wind and rain about a year later."
Life.
"He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He attended Copenhagen University and earned his master's degree in 1841. During this time, he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837. Although they were engaged for a time, Kierkegaard ended the engagement in 1841."
"After breaking up with Regine, he spent much of his time writing book after book, in a highly dramatic yet subtle way. He also wrote some of his works using pen names, or pseudonyms. He died in Copenhagen. Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime, after his death they became influential in the 20th century."
Works.
"Books by Kierkegaard. ""Either/Or"" and ""Fear and Trembling"", both published in 1843, are thought to be especially significant."
Despotism
"Despotism is a form of government that is controlled by one person or a small group of people. The person who controls the state is called a ""despot"". The despot has complete control of the state, like a dictator or tyrant. In history, the pharaohs of Egypt were despots. The word ""despot"" is thought to come from the Ancient Greek word ""despotes"", which means ""the master""."
"According to Montesquieu, the difference between absolute monarchy and despotism is as follows. In the case of the monarchy, a single person governs with absolute power by fixed and established laws, whereas a despot governs by his or her own will and caprice."
The importance of the idea of despotism is that today it is a very common type of dictatorship or direct rule. Ruling monarchies are today few in number.
"Even when there are elections, as there are for the Russian presidency, opposition candidates are at such a disadvantage that they are rarely, if ever, successful."
"Despotism has always been associated with Eastern rather than Western states. Of the former Soviet Union, it is only the new states to the west which have attempted, with difficulties, to build genuine democracies (such as Moldova and Ukraine)."
Lakshadweep
"Lakshadweep (; ISO: , formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (), are a group of islands in the Arabian Sea. They belong to India. Their capital is Kavaratti. It covers an area of . Eleven of the 36 coral atoll islands of Lakshadweep are inhabited."
"The islands are the only coral atolls in India. The people living there are Malayalam and Mahl people, who have been influenced by Arab traders. Lakshadweep is a Muslim region just like the neighbouring Maldives, where tourism is strictly regulated. Lakshadweep has the largest percentage of Muslims - 98%, even larger percentage than Jammu and Kashmir and is the only Muslim-majority Indian administrative division entirely within India."
"Apart from the emerging tourism, government jobs, fishing and coconut production are the mainstays of the Lakshadweep economy."
Daman and Diu
"The territory used to belong to Portugal. In 1961, Indian soldiers and air fighters took control of the territory. In 2020, it merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli to make a new union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu."
Riding helmet
"A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of helmet made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground."
"Helmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders."
Ketchup
"Ketchup is a kind of thick, liquid sauce. It is made from tomatoes, so it is sometimes called tomato sauce. Usually it is used to add flavour to food. Some people like to eat sausages, burgers, hotdogs or fishsticks with ketchup. Ketchup tastes very unlike the real tomato."
History.
Tomato ketchup.
"Although today's ketchup is tomato based, it did not appear until about a century after other types. By 1801, a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison. It was later printed in an American cookbook, the ""Sugar House Book"". James Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in ""The Virginia Housewife"". This was an important 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin."
"As the century went on, ketchup became more popular in the United States. More Americans began to like tomatoes. Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. A man named Jonas Yerks (or Yerkes) is believed to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly after that, other companies did the same. F. &amp; J. Heinz created their tomato ketchup in 1876. Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised: ""Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!"""
"The ""Webster's Dictionary"" of 1913 defined ""catchup"" as a ""table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Written also ketchup]."""
"The holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound. Whisper keys were also invented to prevent overblowing. The bassoon is known for its reedy sound. Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary. Middle register could be used for lullabies because of its majestic and soothing tone. Its lower register is deep, dark, and could be used for scary movies and such."
History and repertoire.
"The bassoon developed from a renaissance instrument called the ""curtal"" or ""dulcian"". These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms. In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line, perhaps playing the same as the cello. A man named Hotteterre made many parts of the modern bassoon. In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra. Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart, and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies. The bassoon was a very important instrument in the orchestra. Mozart and Beethoven gave the bassoon important parts in the music."
Contrabassoon.
"In some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used. This plays an octave lower than a bassoon, taking it right down to bottom B flat or C on the piano. Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower, i.e. the very lowest note of the piano (A). One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra, but in fact the tube keeps doing U-turns, making four parallel rows of tubing. They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards. The weight is supported by a peg to the floor. The contrabassoon used to be shaped like a bassoon."
"The contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra. Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn-like introduction to the last movement of ""Symphony no 1"" by Brahms. It can be clearly heard, growling away, in the opening of the ""Piano Concerto for the Left Hand"" by Ravel."
Octave
An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name.
If a musician sings or plays a scale (‘do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do’) the first and last ‘do’ are an octave apart. It is called an ‘octave’ because there are eight notes in a scale (‘octo’ is Latin for ‘eight’).
If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song “Somewhere over the rainbow” (i.e. the word ‘Somewhere’) these two notes are an octave apart.
"Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar, almost like the same note. The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast. For example: if someone plays Middle C on a piano, a hammer hits the Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second. The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second."
"Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand, if their hands are too small. Most adults can stretch an octave easily (playing one note with the thumb, and the other with the little finger)."
Tinder
Tinder is a material that is used to start fires easily when lit with a match.
Some materials commonly used as tinder are:
Stephen Harper
"Stephen Joseph Harper (born April 30, 1959) is a Canadian economist, entrepreneur, and retired politician. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015. He is a member and the former leader of the Conservative Party, after being elected in 2004. He was elected in February 2006 and replaced Paul Martin as Prime Minister."
"Harper was born in 1959 in Toronto, Ontario and lives in Calgary, Alberta. He is married to Laureen Teskey and has two children. He is the third Prime Minister, after Pierre Trudeau and John Turner, to send their children to Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. Stephen Harper was Prime Minister for nine years, during which Canada hosted both the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games. Harper also hosted the G8 and G20 meetings."
"Harper is a conservative and supports cutting government spending and taxes. As Prime Minister, he has cut the goods and services tax and approved a budget that would cut funding to several government programs. He has also shown support for the military and a bigger Canadian military presence in the northern part of Canada."
"Even though Harper did win the seat in the riding of Calgary Heritage during the October 19, 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party was defeated by the Liberal Party of Canada, which was led by Justin Trudeau and who succeeded Harper as Prime Minister. It was thereafter announced Harper would resign as party leader and had requested an interim leader be chosen to serve until a leadership election can be held."
Tadpole
A tadpole or polliwog is the larva of a frog. It breathes water and lives in the water. Tadpoles hatch from small eggs.
"Frog eggs are round and toad eggs are laid in long strings. Like bird eggs, they have nutrients (food) inside them for the young animal to grow before it hatches."
Movement.
"Tadpoles swim by lateral undulation: their tails move side to side, not up and down."
Food.
"Most types of tadpole eat only plants, for example algae on rocks. Some types of tadpole eat plants and animals, even other smaller tadpoles."
Metamorphosis.
Economic growth.
Coffee was first planted in Costa Rica in the early 19th century. It was first shipped to Europe in 1843. It became Costa Rica's first major export. Coffee would remain Costa Rica's biggest export until the 20th century.
"Most of the coffee exported was transported by oxcart to the Pacific port of Puntarenas. Since the main market for the coffee was in Europe, it soon became a high priority to develop a transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government asked U.S. businessman Minor C. Keith to build a railroad to the Caribbean port of Limón. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890."
"Most Afro-Costa Ricans come from Jamaican immigrants who worked on the railway. United States convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also worked in the construction of the railroad."
"In exchange for making the railroad, Costa Rican gave Keith large amounts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas became the largest export. The United Fruit Company began to hold a major role in the national economy."
20th century.
Costa Rica has enjoyed greater peace and political stability than other Latin American nations.
"But in 1917–19, General Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown. The unpopularity of Tinoco's government led to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military."
"In 1948, José Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising between the previous president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia (he served as president between 1940 and 1944) and Otilio Ulate Blanco. With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day Costa Rican Civil War was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century."
"The victorious rebels formed a government that abolished the military. It oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta relinquished its power on November 8, 1949, to the new democratic government. After that, Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest in 2014. All of them have been widely regarded by the international community as peaceful and transparent."
Geography.
"Costa Rica is on the Central American isthmus. It is between latitudes 8° and 12°N, and longitudes 82° and 86°W. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It has a total of of coastline. Costa Rica also borders Nicaragua to the north ( of border) and Panama to the southeast ( of border). In total, Costa Rica has plus of territorial waters."
"The highest point in the country is Cerro Chirripó, at . The largest lake in Costa Rica is Lake Arenal."
Climate.
"Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the Equator. The climate is tropical all year. The country has many microclimates depending on elevation, rainfall, and the geography of each region."
"Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls. It does not have the four seasons other countries have. The year can be split into two seasons: the dry season (known as summer), and the rainy season (known as winter). The ""summer"" starts in December and ends in April. ""Winter"" starts in May and ends in November. During this time it rains constantly in some regions."
"The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean. Annual rainfall is over . Humidity is also higher here. The mean annual temperature on the coast is around . in the main populated areas, and below on the highest mountains."
"There are many national parks in Costa Rica, including Manuel Antonio National Park."
Plants and animals.
"Costa Rica is home to many plants and animals. The country has only about 0.25% of the world's landmass, but it has 5% of the world's biodiversity. Almost 25% of Costa Rica's land area is in national parks and protected areas. This is the largest percentage of protected areas in the world."
Costa Rica successfully reduced deforestation. It had one of the worst deforestation rates in the world from 1973 to 1989. But it was almost zero by 2005.
"The Corcovado National Park is internationally known by ecologists for its biodiversity. Visitors can see many different types of animals. An example is the big cats and tapirs. Corcovado is the only park in Costa Rica where all four Costa Rican monkeys can be found. These include the white-headed capuchin, the mantled howler,the endangered Geoffroy's spider monkey and the Central American squirrel monkey. The squirrel monkey is found only on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and a small part of Panama."
"Tortuguero National Park is home to spider, howler, and white-throat Capuchin monkeys. It is also the home of three-toed sloth and two-toed sloth. It has 320 species of birds and many reptiles. There is an annual nesting of the endangered green turtle, and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant leatherback, hawksbill, and loggerhead turtles also nest here."
"The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is home to almost 2,000 plant species. Including many orchids. It is also home to more than 400 types of birds. There are more than 100 species of mammals here."
"Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians. They have the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (""Ctenosaura similis"")."
"Provinces, cantons, and districts."
"Article 168 of the Constitution of Costa Rica says the political divisions are classified into 3 groups: provinces, cantons, and districts."
Costa Rica has seven provinces. The provinces are divided into 81 cantons. The canton is directed by a mayor. Mayors are chosen democratically every four years by the canton's people. There are no provincial legislatures. The cantons are further divided into 463 districts.
The provinces are:
Sports.
Costa Rica entered the Summer Olympics for the first time in 1936 with the fencer Bernardo de la Guardia. They entered the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1980 with the skier Arturo Kinch. All four of Costa Rica's Olympic medals were won by the sisters Silvia and Claudia Poll in swimming. Claudia won the country's only gold medal in 1996.
Association football is the most popular sport in Costa Rica. The national team has played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments. They reached the quarter-finals for the first time in 2014. Its best performance in the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup was runner-up in 2002.
"Then in 627, Abu Sufyan led the Quraysh and its allies to attack Medina itself. However, they could not pass the trench that the Muslims had dug around Medina. After several weeks, the coalition broke up and went home. The Medinians were considered victors."
The truce with Mecca.
"After the pagans of Mecca failed to gain control of Medina, the Muslims became stronger. The pagans then decided to sign a truce with the Muslims. This means that they would not fight each other for ten years. The Muslims used this as a chance to talk to other people all over Arabia. In three years, many people changed their religions to Islam."
"But, this truce did not last for long. After three years of it, a small group of horsemen from Mecca attacked a Muslim camp and killed a few of them. The Muslims in Medina heard of this, and the truce was canceled. Abu Sufyan, the third leader of Mecca in Muhammad's lifetime, tried to resume the truce, but Muhammad politely refused the offer. Muhammad told his followers to be ready to capture Mecca. After Mecca was captured, they went on to capture the Torkan."
The capture of Mecca.
"In 630, most people in Arabia had become Muslims, and they became part of Muhammad's large army to capture Mecca. Because of the big size of the army, the people of Mecca were afraid to fight back. Abu Sufyan, who was feeling unhappy over the broken truce, went to Muhammad's camp outside Mecca to ask for forgiveness. Muhammad did not say that he would forgive him, so he returned home. While he was with Muhammad, he changed his religion to Islam by saying the Testimony (ash-Ashaada):"
"""I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."""
"The next day, the Muslim army walked towards Mecca. Everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Ka'aba, believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal ibn Ribah, a former Ethiopian slave, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"Abu Sufyan heard this in his home. From this, he learns that Muhammad forgave him. At that time, Muhammad and his followers removed and broke all idols from the Kaaba. The idols were statues that were worshiped as gods. Muhammad forgave all citizens of Mecca. In the end, Bilal climbed to the top of the Kaaba and called for prayer. This was Muhammad's victory in spreading Islam all over Arabia. But, because he was old, he would not live for long."
His death.
"In 632 AD, on June 8, Muhammad became very sick. Before he died, he told his followers about his death. He is buried in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, where the Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) is. In Medina, his friend Abu Bakr went to the Masjid al-Nabawi and shouted to the people:"
"""If any of you worship Muhammad, you should know that Muhammad is dead. But those of you who worship Allah(SWT) (God), let it be known that Allah(SWT) (God) is alive and cannot die."""
"Although Muhammad died, Islam soon spread all over the Middle East. Then, centuries later, it continued till it reached Africa, Asia and Europe. Islam has become one of the world's biggest and fastest-growing religions."
Relations.
"When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with ""Peace and Blessings be upon him"" (Arabic: ""sall-Allahu `alayhi wa sallam""). For example, ""Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him)"". In printed matter, a calligraphic symbol is frequently used instead of printing the phrase. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr succeeded Muhammad. Shias believe that Ali should have succeeded."
Legacy.
Images of Muhammad.
"Most Muslims do not make or show images of Muhammad. The Qur'an does not state that images of Muhammad must not ever be made, but it does contain passages that forbid the creation of idols. There are also passages against the creation of images of God in the Hadith. Muslims, especially Sunni Muslims, believe there should be no pictures of Muhammad. When people create images of Muhammad, some Muslims may view this as disrespectful, offensive, and emotionally injurious."
"In 2005, a Danish newspaper published political cartoons of Muhammad. More than 100 people died during the ensuing demonstrations. Johan Galtung, a Norwegian mathematician and peace activist, tried to help both sides come together and talk about this. According to Galtung, the attacks against Danish institutions ended after the government had invited talks."
"On 7th January 2015 the Kouachi brothers, hooded and armed with Kalashnikovs, burst into the editorial meeting of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, shooting at the assembled people. They killed cartoonists Cabu, Charb, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, economist Bernard Maris, proof-reader Mustapha Ourrad, police officer Frank Brinsolaro who was protecting Charb, Michel Renaud, founder of the Rendez-vous du Carnet de voyage festival invited to the meeting, and caretaker Frédéric Boisseau. They also seriously wounded cartoonist Riss, journalists Philippe Lançon and Fabrice Nicolino, and webmaster Simon Fieschi."
"As they left the building, just before killing policeman Ahmed Merabet who was lying on the pavement wounded and begging for mercy, the terrorists shouted: “We’ve avenged the prophet, Muhammad”."
"In addition, the following murders have been officially linked to the Charlie Hebdo massacre: Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, a policewoman was killed in the suburb of Montrouge. Four people were taken hostage at a supermarket in the east of Paris. These were Yohan Cohen, 20, who worked at the supermarket, Philippe Braham, 45, a business manager for an IT firm, Yoav Hattab, 21, a student and the youngest supermarket victim, Francois-Michel Saada, 64, was a former pension fund manager."
"Amedy Coulibaly, 32, the hostage-taker in the supermarket, has also been linked by Paris prosecutors to the shooting and wounding of a 32-year-old jogger in a park in south-west Paris, on the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack."
Wives.
A list of his wives' names in chronological order
Khadijah bint Khuwaylid.
"Abdullah ibn Jafar reported that he heard Sayyiduna Ali saying in Kufa that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""The best of the women of her time was Maryam, daughter of Imran, and the best of women of her time was Khadijah, daughter of Khuwaylid."" She was 40 years old when they got married."
Sawda bint Zamʿa.
Sawda bint Zam'a was the first woman to immigrate to Abyssinia in the way of Allah.
Aisha.
"Aisha was a young girl. She is described as very intelligent with a very good memory. Aisha spent the next nine years of her life with Muhammad, she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity, and reported a lot of Muhammad's narrations. She married Muhammad when she was nine years old."
Hafsa bint Umar.
"Aphelion, the point during its orbit, when the Earth is furthest from the Sun, occurs around this date."
Public domain
"Public domain is a phrase that describes something that belongs to all people in general: the public. The public domain contains works (such as books, films, or paintings) that are not under copyright protection."
"The ""opposite"" of ""public domain"" is copyrighted material, which is owned either by the creator of the work or their estate. The term ""public domain"" is only used to describe things that can be copyrighted, such as photographs, drawings, written articles, books or plays, or similar works of art. As a general rule, all intellectual property works, after enough time has gone by, will become part of public domain. Examples include the works of Leonardo da Vinci, William Shakespeare and Ludwig van Beethoven, and the books of Isaac Newton."
A work can enter the public domain in many ways.
"In some cases, if a work enters the public domain after copyright expiration, anyone using the work may still be required to note who created the work. Even if some works are in the public domain due to not being copyrighted, there may be still non-copyright usage restrictions. For examples, even though the design of national currencies may be ineligible, or be unsuitable, for copyright, counterfeiting them for fraud is widely a very serious crime. Another example are logos and images that only have text or simple shapes. These logos aren't copyrighted in the United States, but they are often protected by trademarks."
Child
"A child (the plural is children) is a person below the age of puberty (biologically) or below the age of majority (legally). A person can be called his or her parent's child, no matter how old he or she is, a synonym for the word 'child' is ""kid""."
"In rich countries, children go to school. Small children may go to nursery school, preschool or kindergarten. Playing with small toys and using their imaginations are important for child development. But often in a developing country, children sometimes work in factories or in the fields with their parents or guardians."
"When two people get married and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this marriage, that child is called a ""step child"" by the child's non-birth parent. If both people had children, the children of each parent are ""step brothers"" or ""step sisters"" of each other. A child whose parents have died is an orphan. Orphans with no parent may be raised by grandparents or other relatives. Otherwise they may go to live in an orphanage. They may be adopted by another adult or couple wanting a child. They will then be able to grow up in a new family."
Nickelodeon
"Nickelodeon (often shortened to Nick) is a worldwide cable television network. Airing Sundays-Fridays from 7 a.m.-8 p.m. and Saturdays from 7 a.m.-9 p.m. It is made for children. The network was started in 1983 as Pinwheel. During the late mornings and afternoons, Nickelodeon shows Nick Jr.. This is a group of learning programs and series for younger children. They are shown while the older children are in school. At night, the network shows Nick @ Nite. Nick at Nite is a group of reruns of older series that parents watched when they were younger."
Programming.
"Programming seen on Nickelodeon includes animated series (such as ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", ""The Loud House"", ""The Patrick Star Show"", ', ""The Smurfs"", ""Rugrats"", ""Big Nate"", ""Monster High"", and '), live-action, scripted series (such as ""Danger Force"", ""Tyler Perry's Young Dylan"" and ""All That""), and original made-for-TV movies, while the network's daytime schedule is dedicated to shows targeting preschoolers (such as ""Bubble Guppies"", ""PAW Patrol"", and ""Blue's Clues &amp; You!"")."
Nicktoons.
"Nicktoons is the branding for Nickelodeon's original animated television series. Until 1991, the animated series that aired on Nickelodeon were largely imported from foreign countries, with some original animated specials that were also featured on the channel up to that point."
"Though the Nicktoons branding has seldom been used by the network itself since the 2002 launch of the channel of the same name, original animated series continue to make up a substantial portion of Nickelodeon's lineup. Roughly 6 to 7 hours of these programs are seen on the weekday schedule, and around nine hours on weekends, including a dedicated weekend morning animation block."

"The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle."
Geography.
"The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar."
"In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border."
"In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific."
"The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres."
"The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is deep."
Gulf Stream.
"The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents. One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic. Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole. This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole."
"There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa."
Geology.
"The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south."
The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.
Mercury
Mercury may mean:
Mercury (element)
"Mercury, also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum (pronounced hai-DRAR-jər-əm), is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. Its atomic mass is 200.59."
"The symbol ""Hg"" stands for its Latinized Greek name ""hydrargyrum"", meaning watery or liquid silver."
History.
No one has the credit for finding mercury. It was known in ancient times. Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that are from 2000 BC.
"Chinese people also knew it from long ago. In China and Tibet, people thought using mercury would make them live longer and have better health. One of China's emperors, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì, is said to have been buried in a tomb with rivers of flowing mercury. He died from drinking a mixture of mercury and powdered jade because he wanted to live forever. However, this only made him die of liver failure, poisoning, and brain death. The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments. The Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics. These cosmetics sometimes hurt and made faces uglier."
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Mercury is a silvery-white liquid post-transition metal. The reason for mercury being a liquid is complex. It is heavy; a chunk of iron can float on mercury. Compared to other metals, it does not conduct heat well. However, it conducts electricity fairly well. Mercury is the only metal with a known melting point (−38.83 °C) lower than caesium. Mercury is one of the two elements that are liquids at standard temperature and pressure. Bromine is the other one."
"Mercury may be seen as a transition metal, but it is normally seen as a post-transition metal. It is in Group 12 of the periodic table. Mercury has seven stable (nonradioactive) isotopes. 202Hg is the most common isotope. Mercury makes a blue to ultraviolet color in a tube when a spark is passed through it. The ultraviolet light can kill germs or light fluorescent lamps."
Chemical properties.
"Mercury is an unreactive metal. It does not corrode in air unless hydrogen sulfide is also there, similar to silver. Mercury can oxidize to mercury(II) oxide when heated in air. If it is heated further, it decomposes into mercury and oxygen again. It does not dissolve in ordinary acids, but can dissolve in oxidizing acids to make mercury salts. It can make amalgams when mixed with most metals, like aluminium, gold, and zinc. Iron, tantalum, tungsten, and platinum do not make amalgams with mercury. Iron flasks were used to trade mercury because of this."
"Mercury can dissolve large amounts of aluminium metal, making it dangerous to transport in aluminium containers. The thin layer of oxide on aluminium stops it from amalgamating (making an amalgam with) aluminium, but the oxide coating can be damaged to expose the metal. Then the aluminium metal is dissolved and oxidizes to aluminium oxide. The aluminium oxide forms a solid and releases the mercury, which amalgamates more aluminium. This process keeps repeating until a large amount of aluminium is dissolved."
Chemical compounds.
"Mercury forms chemical compounds in 2 oxidation states: +1 and +2. Mercury(I) compounds are weak oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents. Most of them are colorless. They easily disproportionate to mercury(II) compounds and mercury metal. They react with oxygen in the air to make mercury(II) compounds. Many mercury(I) compounds do not dissolve in water. Mercury(I) chloride is one of the most common mercury(I) compounds. Mercury(II) compounds are strong oxidizing agents and very corrosive. Mercury(II) compounds are red, yellow, or colorless. Mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) chloride are the most common mercury(II) compounds in the laboratory."
Volcanoes.
Volcanoes are the places where magma reaches the earth's surface. The type of volcano depends on the location of the eruption and the consistency of the magma.
Intrusions.
"Intrusive volcanism is when magma is forced into the rocks that make up the Earth's crust. When it cools and become solid while still underground, different features called plutons are formed. The rock formed is intrusive igneous rock."
These plutons will be exposed at the surface of land when the overlying rocks are removed after a long time of denudation (laid bare by erosion).
"Major features formed by intrusive volcanicity include: batholith, laccolith, dyke, pipe and sill."
Extrusions.
"The molten magma under great pressure forces its way through the fissure of underground rocks and reaches the Earth's surface to form ""igneous extrusion""."
"Major extruded materials include gas, liquid and solid."
Features formed are:
Pacific Ocean
"The Pacific Ocean is the body of water between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It is the largest named ocean and it covers one-third of the surface of the entire world. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn south from Cape Horn, Chile/Argentina to Antarctica, and joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn south from Tasmania, Australia to Antarctica."
"As the Atlantic slowly gets wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking. It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the centre of the Earth - this is called subduction. This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosions of hot rocks and dust. When an earthquake happens under the sea, the quick jerk causes a tsunami. This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else. Many of the Earth's volcanoes are either islands in the Pacific, or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean's edge. Plate tectonics are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller."
Antarctica
"Antarctica is the Earth's southernmost continent. It is on the South Pole. It is almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle. Around Antarctica is the Southern Ocean. It is the fifth-largest continent in area after Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. About 99% of Antarctica is covered by ice. This ice averages at least 1.6 kilometers (1.0 miles) thick."
"Antarctica is the coldest, driest and windiest continent. It is also, on average, the highest of all the continents. Antarctica is considered a desert. It has yearly precipitation of only 200 mm (8 inches) near the sea and far less inland. No humans live in Antarctica permanently. However, about 1,000 to 5,000 people live through the year at the science stations in Antarctica. Only plants and animals that can live in cold live there. The animals include penguins, seals, nematodes, tardigrades and mites. Plant life includes some grass and shrubs, algae, lichen, fungi, and bacteria."
"The first known sighting of the continent was in 1820. Antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the 19th century. This was because of its hostile environment, few resources, and isolation. The first official use of the name ""Antarctica"" as a continental name in the 1890s is said to have been used by Scottish cartographer John George Bartholomew."
"The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 by 12 countries. More countries have signed the treaty since then. So far, 46 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty declares that military activities and mineral mining are against the law. However, it supports scientific research. It also helps the continent's ecozone. More than 4,000 scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together."
Geography and geology.
"Antarctica is covered by an ice sheet about four kilometres thick. Under the ice it is mostly land, although the ice shelves are over the ocean. The Transantarctic Mountains divide the land between East Antarctica in the Eastern Hemisphere and West Antarcticain the Western Hemisphere."
"Antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice. One is Lake Vostok, which has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years. The lake is 250 km long and 50 km wide. Another is the huge Gamburtsev mountain chain, which are the size of the Alps, yet entirely buried under the ice. The Gamburtsev range has a nearby massive rift valley similar to the East African Great Rift Valley. It is called the Lambert system. Scientists used radar that can work under ice to survey the whole of Antarctica."
Ancient Antarctica.
"Scientists say Antarctica used to be much further north and much warmer, moving to where it is now through continental drift. From 2011 to 2013, scientists collected fossils of frogs, water lilies, and shark and ray teeth, showing that these life forms used to live on Antarctica. The frog fossils were about 40 million years old. Scientists say marsupials, animals that keep their babies in pouches, could have started in South America, migrated to a warm ancient Antarctica, and gone to Australia from there."
Life in Antarctica.
Plants.
"Few land plants grow in Antarctica. This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture (water), sunlight, good soil, or a warm temperature. Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer. However, moss, lichen and algae do grow. The most important organisms in Antarctica are the plankton which grow in the ocean."
Animals.
"One important source of food in the Antarctic is the krill, which is a general term for the small shrimp-like marine crustaceans. Krill are near the bottom of the food chain: they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton. Krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet. Whales, penguins, seals, and even some of the birds that live in Antarctica, all depend on krill."
"Whales are the largest animals in the ocean, and in Antarctica. They are mammals, not fish. That means that they breathe air and do not lay eggs. Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica."
"Whalers have hunted whales for hundreds of years, for meat and blubber. Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area."
"The recorder is one of the oldest and most popular woodwinds and has been used to great effect by greats, such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi. The general public is normally only familiar with the plastic, child's version of the recorder, but professional and high-quality recorders are still made of wood."
"The saxophone may look like a brass instrument, but it is played like a clarinet and therefore it is a woodwind instrument. It is usually played in bands and jazz groups."
Use.
Woodwind instruments are played in several ways. The flute is played by blowing across the top of the mouthpiece. It is like blowing across the top of an empty bottle. The oboe and bassoon both have a double reed. It is like blowing through a drinking straw. Bagpipes have double reeds which are inside the mouthpiece (“enclosed reeds”). The clarinet and saxophone have single reeds which are clamped against the opening of the mouthpiece.
"In comparison, brass instruments are all blown in the same way: by blowing against a cup-shaped mouthpiece. This is why the saxophone cannot be called a brass instrument, although it is made of brass."
The way that a player shapes his mouth to blow an instrument is called the “embouchure”. Woodwind instruments have several different embouchures.
"In an orchestra there may be two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons. In larger orchestras, particularly from the Romantic period onwards, there may be three or four. Sometimes the extra instruments such as the piccolo are used. If, for example, in an orchestral piece the third flute is marked “doubling piccolo”, it means that the person playing flute 3 will also play the piccolo. However, if the piccolo plays at the same time as flute 3 they will obviously need an extra player for the piccolo part."
Woodwind instruments in an orchestra often have short solos. These will be played by the first player (the “section principal”).
Bewitched
Bewitched is a comedy television show that was shown on TV by ABC from 1964 to 1972. It is about a man who is married to a witch.
"The lead characters are Darrin and Samantha Stephens. Samantha twitches her nose or moves her hands to make a spell happen. Samantha was played by Elizabeth Montgomery. Darrin was played by Dick York from 1964 to 1969. Because of illness, Dick York left the show and was replaced by Dick Sargent who played Darrin from 1969 to 1972. Samantha's mother Endora was played by Agnes Moorehead. Endora dislikes Darrin and often makes things difficult for him."
Dumbo
"Dumbo is a 1941 American animated movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released on October 23, 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures. The fourth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, ""Dumbo"" is based upon a child's book of the same name by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Perl. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a baby elephant who is cruelly nicknamed Dumbo. He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using them as wings. Throughout most of the movie, his only true friend aside from his mother is the mouse Timothy, making fun of the stereotype between mice and elephants. ""Dumbo"" was made to make up for the damages of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"". The movie has been criticized in recent years as being ""racist"" (the leader crow in the movie was named ""Jim Crow"" and at some point in the 1950s was renamed ""Dandy Crow"" in attempt to avoid controversy, but the original name is still the one mostly known, although it was supposed to be just a sarcastic mockery to the Jim Crow laws in the Southern USA back then and was used only on the character's model sheets), yet is also considered to be one of Disney's best movies. It was an attempt to be simple and make profits for the Disney studio, is now generally regarded as a classic of animation. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features."
The story.
"Florida, 1941. Mrs. Jumbo sadly looks on how babies are delivered by the stork to other circus animals. As even a baby elephant makes a pretty heavy package, hers is the last to arrive, but soon becomes the laughing stock of the others because of his big ears, getting meanly named ""Dumbo"" by the others. When Mrs. Jumbo can not take the public making fun of her son, she is locked up as ""mad elephant"", and Dumbo finds himself all alone. A mouse named Timothy comes and scares the mean herd. He encourages Dumbo and tells the circus director to make Dumbo the top (literally) of an elephant pyramid stunt which ends up literally bringing the house down, and Dumbo is given the job of ""baby clown"" in a repetitive, humiliating and dangerous number as punishment. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy brings him to go see his mother. The next morning, they find themselves up in a tree with a bunch of crows, who discover that Dumbo can fly."

Characters.
Dumbo the Flying Elephant.
"Dumbo is the main character in the movie. He is a fictional anthropomorphic elephant who has really big ears. He can fly using his big ears. Similar to Dopey from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and Gideon in ""Pinocchio"", Dumbo has no spoken dialogue. However, in the live-action/puppet television series ""Dumbo's Circus"", Dumbo was voiced by Katie Leigh."
"In the movie, Dumbo is delivered by Mr. Stork, and is made fun of for the strange size of his ears. As his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, beats up the bullies who pick on her baby, the ringmaster has his helpers chain her up and lock her up in a trailer, which says: ""MAD ELEPHANT"". It is then that Timothy Q. Mouse looks after Dumbo. The two of them try to make Dumbo famous and get his mother free. Thanks to the help of a ""magic feather"" from some crows, Dumbo flies to fame, and gets his mother free."
Timothy the Mouse.
"Timothy Q. Mouse is a mouse who became the only friend of elephants Dumbo and his mother Mrs. Jumbo. He teaches Dumbo how to become the ninth wonder of the universe, and the only flying elephant in the whole world."
Mrs. Jumbo.
"Mrs. Jumbo is Dumbo's mother. Deeply depressed at not having her baby delivered, she loves her son more than anything. She becomes angry when the boys pick on him."
"Other characters include the other elephants who also make fun of Dumbo, the Ringmaster, the clowns of the circus, the Pink Elephants, Mr. Stork and the Crows who give Dumbo the ""magic feather"" and teach him to fly."
Release.
"Even though World War II was going on, ""Dumbo"" was still the most financially successful Disney movie of the 1940s. This was one of the first of Disney's animated movies to be broadcast, albeit severely edited, on television, as part of Disney's anthology series. The movie then received another distinction of note in 1981, when it was the first of Disney's canon of animated movies to be released on home video and also was released in the ""Walt Disney Classics"" Video Collection in 1985. That release was followed by remastered versions in: 1986, 1989, 1991 (Classics), and 1994 (Masterpiece). In 2001, a 60th Anniversary Special Edition was released that has original RKO titles. In 2006, a ""Big Top Edition"" of the movie was released on DVD that also has original RKO titles. A UK Special Edition was released in May 2007 and was a successful Disney release."
Reception.
"The movie received very good reviews and did well at the box office despite being released less than 2 months before ""World War II""."
CNDO is the short cut for Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap. It is both 1) a method for learning key facts about molecular orbitals as well as 2) the name of a particular set of computer programs. CNDO is based on quantum chemistry. It is one of the first semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods. It uses two approximations:
"CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule. CNDO starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them. Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals. From this information, CNDO computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals."
CNDO/2 is the main version of CNDO. John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO/2.

Selena (movie)
"Selena is an epic biographical drama movie. It was released on March 21, 1997, by Warner Bros. Gregory Nava was the director and the screenwriter. The movie is about the singer Selena. She was murdered at age 23 by her friend, an ex-employee of her clothing stores. The movie also describes how Selena started in the music business and her family's problems. Jennifer Lopez starred as Selena, and many music critics believe this movie made Lopez famous. ""Selena"" was produced by Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Selena's father), Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz."
"Lopez was given $1 million for her role as Selena, making her the highest-paid Hispanic woman ever, at the time. The contained two unreleased songs, two tribute songs and two melodies. It reached number seven on the US ""Billboard"" 200 chart. It was certified platinum for shipments of one million copies in the United States.bagamash"
"Nava had a budget of $20 million to make this movie. They filmed the movie in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas. Over 35,000 fans participated in the Houston Astrodome scene. The movie made $15,599,598 on its first week, the number one movie for that week. In total, it made $35,281,794 in 101 days. ""Selena"" had mostly good reviews from critics, though many thought the movie did not tell the true story of Selena. The movie won several ALMA Awards and Imagen Foundation Awards. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award."
Plot.
"The movie starts with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) getting ready for her Houston Astrodome concert on February 26, 1995. After her performance, the movie goes back in time to 1961. Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. (Edward James Olmos) and his band Los Dinos are at band practice. After band practice, they went to see a promoter in the other side of town. Los Dinos are then discriminated for being Americans of Mexican heritage. Los Dinos then performed at a Spanish nightclub, and are booed off stage by Mexicans for not knowing any Mexican music. The movie goes forward in time to 1981. Abraham had quit his dreams of becoming a music star and began helping his family. After work, Abraham sat down on his chair and began playing the guitar. His youngest child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) was playing a football game in the backyard. She noticed her father and was curious to know what he was doing. She started to sing in front of Abraham. Abraham was surprised, he started a family band, and named it Selena y Los Dinos. He puts A.B. Quintanilla III (Rafael Tamayo) on base and Suzette Quintanilla (Victoria Elena Flores) on drums. Selena became the singer of the group."
"The movie is now set in 1989, where Selena is performing at a Houston, Texas festival as an adult. In the next scene, Selena began talking to her cousin (Seidy Lopez) about her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Suzette (Jackie Guerra) ran upstairs and told them that a rock guitarist is in their kitchen. The three of them began spying to see what's going on. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) began to audition as the band's new guitarist in front of Abraham. Abraham tells A.B. (Jacob Vargas) that he does not like Chris. This is because he is a rocker. However, A.B. tries to tell Abraham that Chris will change his style and look. The next day, Selena asks Chris to eat with her at a pizzeria. In the next scene, Selena's song ""Como La Flor"" reached number one on ""Billboard"" which made the group come together and celebrate. Selena is asked to perform in Mexico where 50,000 fans are waiting on her to sing. Selena came out to perform ""La Carcacha"". However, the crowd became very excited and started pushing people inside of the stage. Selena is later asked by her father to calm down the crowd. She performed a slower version of ""Como La Flor"" and calmed everyone down. After her performance, she and Chris walked on a pier. Selena told him that she was scared for the first time, while Chris tells Selena that he loves her."
"While on the bus, Abraham found out that Chris liked Selena. Abraham tells Chris and Selena that their relationship is over. He then fires Chris and orders him to leave. Selena tried to run after him, however, her father told her that if she did that he will disband the group. After this, Selena and Chris began to meet secretly and they eloped. Selena went to her father's house the next day. Abraham began crying and told Selena that he was sorry. He then accepted Chris into the family. In the next scene, Selena won a Grammy Award and opened her clothing stores. She hired Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as the manager. Yolanda began to steal money from these places. After this, Selena started recording songs for her crossover album. Abraham later finds out that Yolanda was stealing money, and holds a meeting to hear Yolanda's side. Yolanda tells Abraham that if given time, she will prove her innocence. Later that night, Selena performed ""Si Una Vez"" at the Houston Astrodome on February 26, 1995. After that night, Selena asked her mother to scratch her head and that she and Chris are thinking of starting a family. Selena then dreams of the crossover tour and sings ""Dreaming of You"". After Selena sings the opening of the song, a rose is thrown at her. Selena is seen being rushed to the hospital. Reporters tells everyone that Selena was shot by Saldívar during an argument over the missing financial records. In the next scene, a doctor walks towards Selena's parents. He tells them that Selena has died. ""Dreaming of You"" is played again, while her fans are seen holding pictures of her during a candlelight vigil. The movie ends with a picture of Selena waving goodbye reading ""April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995""."

Production and marketing.
"Selena's family wanted to make a movie about Selena's life. They searched Hollywood, California for movie producers. Abraham then contacted Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz. They chose Gregory Nava as the movie director. Abraham told Esparza and Katz that he did not like Nava because of his ""ego"". The two producers told Abraham that everyone in Hollywood had an ""ego problem"". They also told him that Nava was the right guy."
"Nava spent one month with the Quintanilla family. He wrote down everything that the family said about Selena. By the fifth week, Nava had written the movie and showed Abraham the draft. Abraham was not happy — he did not want Selena's fans to think that eloping was a right thing to do. He also did not like the conflict between his character and Chris Perez. Nava responded that the information was ""life events"". He also said that even though he may seem like a ""bad guy"" in the movie, his actions after the marriage would make people see him differently. Abraham agreed and allowed the two stories in the movie. Salma Hayek was originally asked to play the role of Selena in the movie, but she turned it down. She felt that it was ""too early"" to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional since Selena's death was still being covered on television."
"After Muhammad died in 632, a new head of the state, called caliph, was named: Abu Bakr. He was the first of the four caliphs whose caliphate was called that of the Rashidun, which means 'rightly guided.' After dealing with the Ridda wars, wars against rebellious tribes who rebelled after Muhammad's death, he started to campaign against the Byzantines. Abu Bakr himself did not live to see the results of his initiative after suffering a natural death in 634. But his successors sure did."
"Umar was the second caliph and managed to lead the Muslims to conquer Roman Egypt and even expand to present day Libya in the west. All the way to eventually the Indus River in the east after conquering the Sassanid Empire. Eventually in 644 it was neither the past famines or plagues that killed Umar, but a Persian slave."
"Uthman ibn Affan followed Umar as a caliph and ruled the longest of the four caliphs. In his twelve years of rule he standardized the Qur'an, spread the empire westwards to the Maghreb and even a part of Spain and eastward further into Central Asia. He was also assasinated which lead to Ali ibn Abi Talib being the fourth Sunni caliph and the first Shia imam."
The Umayyad and Abbasid Empire.
The death and assassination of Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 gave birth to a new era where the Umayyad Caliphate thrived and continued to expand the land left by the Rashidun.
Modern history.
Wahhabism and the First Saudi State.
"After Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab got exiled from Uyaynah, he sought refuge in Diriyah, where some of his followers were residing. At that time, Muhammad bin Saud was the local chieftain of Diriyah. Two brothers and the wife of Muhammad bin Saud were followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab's ideology. They encouraged cooperation between Muhammad bin Saud and Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab. Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab needed military support to secure his ideology and preaching, while Muhammad bin Saud needed pastoral support. Fulfilling these needs eventually led to an alliance between the scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and the local ruler Muhammad bin Saud creating the First Saudi State, the Emirate of Diriyah."
"When Muhammad bin Saud died in 1765, his son Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud who was a dedicated student of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, became the leader of the Emirate of Diriyah. In his reign, the Emirate of Diriyah expanded in territory throughout the Arabian Peninsula. In the eastern part of the peninsula, Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud got Al-Hasa, Qatar, Al-Buraimi and Bahrain under his influence. In the western part of the Peninsula, Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud conquered parts of the Hejaz region. During the conquests of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud, the Saudi State got involved in a war with the Ottomans. At this stage, the campaigns of the Ottomans against the Saudi State failed, and Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud was expanding his territory inside Ottoman territories. With the death of Abdulaziz bin Muhammad Al Saud in 1803, his son Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud became ruler. Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud conquered the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a few years, which gave him the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Eventually the Egyptians, who were supported and led by the Ottomans, destroyed the powers of Al Saud in 1818. It marked the end of the First Saudi State."
Ottoman domination.
"By 1824, the Al Saud family regained control over parts of the Nejd region. This is seen as the beginning of the Second Saudi State, the Emirate of Nejd. The Saudi ruler, Turki bin Ali, made Riyadh the capital of its state. It remains the capital of the Saudi State today. Turki bin Ali succeeded in retaking most of the lands lost to the Ottomans. In 1865 the Ottomans launched an attack on the Saudi State again. This time with help from the Al Rasheed family of Ha'il, who are another powerful family of the Nejd region. The Al Rasheed family defeated the Saudi State in 1891, which marked the end of the Second Saudi State. Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud, who was the Saudi leader at that time, retreated into the desert and eventually to Kuwait with his family."
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
"In 1902, Abdul Rahman's son Abdulaziz regained Saudi territory from the Al Rasheed family. He even regained control over Mecca and Medina from 1924 to 1925. In 1932 he declared the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as it is known till today."
Boundaries.
"The discussion for Saudi Arabia to fixate definite boundaries with its neighboring countries started from 1920 onwards. It finalized its boundaries with Iraq, Jordan, and Kuwait. On borders with Iraq and Kuwait, two neutral zones were created – one with Iraq and the other one with Kuwait. In 1934, borders with Yemen were almost finalized.In 1965, Saudi Arabia gave some of its areas to Jordan, and Jordan gave some of its areas to Saudi Arabia. In 1971, the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was split between these two countries. Likewise, Saudi Arabia and Iraq decided in 1981 to split the neutral zone between them. This zone was split between the two countries in 1984."
"Still, Saudi Arabia's borders with the United Arab Emirates and Oman were not final. The border with Qatar was finalized in 2001."
Politics.
"King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud died in 1953. His son, who was named Saud, became the king. He reigned for 11 years. In 1964, he was forced to step down, and his half-brother, Faisal, became the king. Faisal had the support of the senior members of the royal family and the religious leaders. Faisal also held the post of the Prime Minister. This tradition of being both the King and the Prime Minister still continues in Saudi Arabia. All Kings after Faisal have followed this practice."
"Faisal took several new steps for economic development of Saudi Arabia. During his reign, many important political events also happened like the ones noted below:"
"In 1975, King Faisal was assassinated by one of his nephews. The nephew was found guilty, and he was sentenced to death. King Faisal's half-brother Khalid became the King and the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of King Khalid, Saudi Arabia's importance in regional politics increased. The economic growth of the country also continued at a steady rate until his death."
King Fahd's period.
"King Khalid died in 1982. After his death, Fahd became the King. At the same time, he also became the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. His half-brother Prince Abdullah became the Crown Prince."
The income of Saudi Arabia became less during King Fahd's reign. This was a result of lower price of petroleum oil. King Fahd's government used an economic policy that helped the country to survive with a lower income.
King Fahd helped Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq's economy had become terrible on account of this war. The King also discussed with these two countries to stop fighting. Both countries (Iran and Iraq) stopped the fight in August 1988. The King also helped in making the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) a more vital organization. The GCC is an organization of six countries Persian Gulf. The purpose of the organization is to increase the development of and cooperation among the member countries.
Gulf War.
"In 1990, Saddam Hussain was ruling Iraq. The Gulf War of 1991 was when he invaded Kuwait. Many people thought that his army would also invade Saudi Arabia. King Fahd allowed some Western countries and the USA to send their forces to the country. Many Muslims were against that their most holy land was used by non-Muslim soldiers."
"During and after the Gulf War, King Fahd’s role was vital. During the war, he allowed the entry of the royal family of Kuwait inside Saudi Arabia and was followed by 400,000 other persons from Kuwait to stay temporarily. The King let the troops of countries like the USA mount attacks on Kuwait to liberate it. He also helped arrange support from former Muslim countries for the liberation of Kuwait. Iraqi forces were eventually ousted from Kuwait."
Terrorism.
"The presence of troops from Western countries has angered many Muslims. One of them was the rich man Osama bin Laden. He was forced to leave Saudi Arabia when he disagreed and opposed the King of Saudi Arabia. Other than Osma bin Laden and his followers, several other persons and groups did not like the presence of Western troops inside Saudi Arabia."
Those who opposed the presence of Western troops were persons and groups who attacked people. They tried mainly to attack the foreign forces in Saudi Arabia. Some examples of such attacks are given below:
"The September 11, 2001 attacks in New York had resulted into many deaths and big destruction. After enquiry, it came to light that out of 19 suspected persons for these attacks, 15 were from Saudi Arabia."
"Such things attracted the attention of the government of Saudi Arabia. The government started a policy to check such activities. Even then, terrorist activities of such persons and groups continued."
Amazonas
Amazonas is the name of four places in South American nations:
1740s
The 1740s was a decade that began on 1 January 1740 and ended on 31 December 1749.
Tocantins (state)
"Tocantins is a state in central Brazil. The state was made in 1988 out of the northern part of Goiás, and construction began on the capital, Palmas, in 1989. Palmas is much newer than most cities in the area."
The state is the border between the Amazon Rainforest and Brazil's grassy flatlands. The state is very important for raising and selling cows and other farm animals.
Amazon rainforest
The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world.
"The forest is in a basin drained mainly by the Amazon River, with 1100 tributaries. It is a moist broadleaf forest which covers seven million square kilometers (1.7 billion acres). Of this, five and a half million square kilometers (1.4 billion acres) are covered by the rainforest."
"This region includes territory from nine nations. Most of the forest is in Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, and Colombia with 10%. Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana have just a small amount of rainforest."
"The Amazon has over half of the planet's rainforest area. It has many species of plants some include rosewood, mahogany and ebony. It is the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. The forest was formed at least 55 million years ago, in the Eocene period."
Biodiversity.
Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome. Tropical forests in the Americas have more species than African and Asian wet forests.
More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest. It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity.
"The region is home to ~2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of species of plants, and some 2000 species of birds and mammals and a similar number of fish. The diversity of plant species is the highest on earth with some experts estimating that one square kilometre may contain over 75,000 types of trees and 150,000 species of higher plants. One square kilometre of Amazon rainforest can have about 90,000 tons of living plants. This is the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world. One in five of all the birds in the world live here. To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or cataloged."
Conservation.
More than a fifth of the Amazon rainforest has already been destroyed. The forest which remains is threatened. People who care for the environment warn about the loss of biodiversity. They also point out that releasing the carbon which is stored in the trees will increase global warming.
"Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity due to the destruction of the forest. Also, the release of the carbon in the vegetation would accelerate global warming. Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's productivity on land and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems. of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996."
"Some people have calculated that it may even pay to save the forest. They said that one hectare of Amazonian forest in Peru is worth about US$6280, if it is used to harvest fruits, latex and timber (wood). If all the wood is cut down for timber, it has a value of about US$1000. Obviously, this can only be done once; it is not sustainable. When the forest has been cleared, the hectare of land can be used as a pasture, and is worth about US$148. Not all people agree on the study; some have questioned the assumptions behind it."
"The Brazilian Air Force has been using surveillance aircraft to monitor the forest. At a conference in 2004, scientists warned that the rainforest will no longer be able to absorb the millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually, as it usually does, because of the increased speed of rainforest destruction."
"By 2018, about 17% of the Amazon rainforest had been destroyed. When 20–25% (3–8% more) is destroyed, the climate will change. It will flip to a non-forest ecosystem – degraded savannah. As their homelands continue to be destroyed by deforestation, rainforest peoples are also disappearing."
Rubber boom.
"Once the process of vulcanization was invented, companies began to make many kinds of new rubber products, such as boots and seals for machines. American and European companies began buying large amounts of latex from Brazil. This boom in Brazilian rubber began around 1870, but the need for automobile tires brought the greatest wealth to the new rubber producers."
"Other rain forests have rubber trees, but Amazonia has by far the best. However, the trees could not be farmed on plantations because if they were next to each other, the insects would eat them. Therefore, people had to find the trees in the rain forest, cut slits in them, leave cups to collect the latex, and come back later to get it."
Thousands of people moved to the rain forest to work collecting rubber. Most of these people were hired by rich rubber merchants. The rubber merchants loaned them money to come down the river and buy tools. Each merchant’s collectors had to sell the rubber only to their rubber merchant at low prices and buy supplies only from them at high prices. That meant the collectors were always in debt to their merchant and could not leave to do something else. The rubber merchants quickly became very rich.
"The center of the rubber trade was Manaus on the Rio Negro. It became first a boom town and then a beautiful, wealthy city. It had electricity before most of the cities in the United States did. The newly rich merchants built huge expensive homes and brought in automobiles to travel on the city’s few roads. They built a magnificent opera house with crystal chandeliers and decorated tiles brought all the way from Europe."
"However, the rubber boom only lasted about forty years, ending by 1913. Some men had taken the seeds of the Amazon rubber trees and began growing them in the Asian rain forests. The trees grew well there, and they could be grown on plantations. The insects that could destroy them were in South America. So the price of rubber began to fall, and the rubber boom stopped."
One part of getting e-mail addresses is to find addresses that are still in use. One trick used by spammers is to put a link at the end of a message like this:
"If the person clicks on the link, it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address. Then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually open spam messages. Next, the spammers sell that list to other spammers. The same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer (called ""replying""), which also tells the spammer the message has been opened."
Method two.
"Another trick that spammers use is to put a picture – even one that cannot be seen – into a spam message. The picture will have a name that goes with just that one email. When the email is opened, a request will be sent to the server that has that picture to get the image. If they get this request, then they know that you read their email, which could cause a person to receive even more email spam."
Other meanings.
"The word ""spamming"" is also used to describe the act of typing a lot of words or text in Internet chat rooms, so that other people using the chatroom cannot carry on conversations. Usually this blocks the screen with meaningless words, in order to annoy the other people in the chatroom. Spamming in Internet chatrooms is usually considered to be rude. This kind of behavior is usually called ""flooding"" rather than ""spamming""."
"The word ""spam"" is often (mistakenly) applied to emails containing content that the receiver sees as silly or simply meaningless (e.g. yujhcykgfvylfuv,uyguvgy)."
Problems with spam.
"Computer users at home and in workplaces waste a lot of time opening and deleting spam messages. In some cases, spam emails contain viruses or links to pornography or illegal gambling websites. Spam emails often advertise products or services which are being lied about by the companies sending the spam, such as frauds or scams."
Spam prevention.
"Some user email programs can automatically delete spam messages when they arrive, or move them to a separate spam folder. Internet service providers also detect them automatically and cooperate to cut off customers who are major spammers."
Earthquake
"An earthquake is a sudden movement or trembling of the Earth's tectonic plates, that creates shaking of the ground. This shaking can destroy buildings and break the Earth's surface."
"Earthquakes are caused by disturbances in the balance of the earth. The different tectonic plates slowly move past each other. When they get stuck, they build up tension. The earthquake happens when the tectonic plates are suddenly released, so they start to move very quickly. An earthquake's first point of rupture is called its hypocenter, or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter."
"People who study about earthquakes are called seismologists. There can be many earthquakes over a short period of time in a small area. The sudden release of tension in the tectonic plates sends waves of energy that travel through the Earth. Seismology studies the cause, repeats, type, and size of earthquakes."
"The effect of an earthquake can be measured by a seismometer. It detects the shakes caused and it puts these movements on a seismograph. The strength, or magnitude, of an earthquake, is measured using the Richter scale. The Richter Scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. The scale is numbered 0-10. On the scale, 2 is scarcely noticeable, and magnitude 5 (or more) creates damage over a wide area. The largest earthquake ever measured was a 9.5. An earthquake of 10 has never been recorded."
"Scientists cannot predict an earthquake before it happens. But we do know where earthquakes might happen in the future, like close to fault lines. An earthquake under the ocean can create a huge wave called a tsunami. This can create just as much destruction as the earthquake itself. Earthquakes can also create landslides."
Zones.
"Earthquake zones are concentrated in some parts of the world. The first is the Pacific belt, which circles the Pacific Ocean. This part is the biggest seismic belt: it has the most active earthquakes and the most volcanoes."
"The second part is the Alpide belt. It includes the seismic activities from Sumatra, to the Himalayas, to south Europe and north Africa, to the Atlantic Ocean."
These belts are along the edges of tectonic plates. The tectonic plates push on each other and make great amounts of tension.
History.
Earthquakes sometimes hit cities and kill hundreds or thousands of people. Most earthquakes happen along the Pacific Ring of Fire but the biggest ones mostly happen in other places. Tectonically active places are places where earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are quite repeated.
Causes of an earthquake.
"Earthquakes are caused by tectonic movements in the Earth's crust. The main cause is when tectonic plates ride one over the other, causing orogeny (mountain building), and severe earthquakes."
"The boundaries between moving plates form the largest fault surfaces on Earth. When they stick, motion between the plates leads to increasing stress. This continues until the stress rises and breaks, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault. This releases the stored energy as shock waves. The San Andreas fault in San Francisco, and Rift valley fault in Africa are faults like this."
"1. Volcanic Earthquakes: Earthquakes which are caused by volcanic eruptions are quite devastating. However, these are confined to areas of active volcanoes."
"2. Collapse Earthquakes: In areas of intense mining activity, often the roofs of underground mines collapse and minor tremors take place. These are called collapse earthquakes."
Earthquake fault types.
"There are three main types of geological fault that may cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened. Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other."
Earthquake clusters.
"Informal education is less organized. It may be a parent teaching a child how to prepare a meal or ride a bicycle. People can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library or educational websites. This may also be called self-education. Some quite famous men have been largely self-educated, like Alfred Russell Wallace."
"Unschooling is when kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings. Instead, they go on websites, play games, or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way. The experience of children with ""unstructured"" lives is that they get into trouble."
Deschooling is a more drastic approach. It advocates abolishing schools. It was put forward in the USA of the 1960s and 1970s. It is no longer an active movement.
Schooling.
"Many public schools (U.S. terminology) provide a free education through the government. Parents may send their own children to a private school, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do not make education available, or because their families do not have enough money, or because the children have to work for money, or because the society has prejudice against education for girls."
There are primary schools and secondary schools. In many places they are government funded. Colleges and universities usually charge fees (tuition payments) which may be different in different countries.
Army
"The army is the part of a country's military that fights on the ground. People in the army are called soldiers. Many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks, airplanes, and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground."
"A soldier may be a volunteer (someone who joins something because they want to), or he may be forced by the government to join the army. Forcing men to join the army is called conscription or ""draft"". Voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers, but high in confidence and quality. Drafted armies are large, but often lacking in confidence and in quality: it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will. Sometimes an army is made up from mercenaries, who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to the country which they serve."
"Soldiers do many things, from shooting enemies, to digging defensive trenches. They are used to defend their country, or attack another country's army. It is difficult, and soldiers must be in good shape, both physically and mentally. They almost always move together, and that way the team can do more things, in a safer way. They may be assigned to certain places to guard, or they may be told to search a place, or even attack it. That is up to their commander. Every soldier answers to someone else, so that way, everything is organized."
"Sometimes, when a country's army is busy in different places, and there are not enough soldiers to do more, a country can hire civilians to do some of the army's jobs, like protecting buildings and important people and convoys of trucks traveling from one place to another. Usually, they hire veterans who were members of the military before leaving and working elsewhere."
"Working in the army and wearing the uniform is called ""service"". A soldier will never say ""I work as a Sergeant in the signal corps"" but always ""I ""serve"" as a Sergeant in the signal corps"", or other rank, specialty and unit. Only civilian workers who do not wear uniform speak about ""working"" in the army."
Military strength.
"Despite the growing importance of military technology, military activity depends above all on people. For example, in 2000 the British Army declared: ""Man is still the first weapon of war."""
Discipline.
The function of the army is based on discipline. That means that every soldier will unquestionably carry out the orders which he or she has received and will obey his or her superior officer or non-commissioned officer. There is only one exception: orders which violate the human rights or international law must not be obeyed as it is considered a war crime. The chain of command is expressed by the military rank system and hierarchy.
Gear.
"A soldier is supplied with weapons, such as guns, knives, and other simple gear for surviving in the battlefield, such as food, water, clothes, and tents. They must keep good care of the items. Some soldiers train to be a doctor for the army, or other civilian duties."
Qualifications.
"Before a soldier joins the army, he must qualify to be in it first. The person is put through tests, so that the army will know if the recruit can do it or not. This is sometimes called 'boot camp'. He must complete mental tests, and physical tests. It depends on where he is testing that will tell him how hard it will be. He will also take tests to determine what job he will do in the military. For instance, he may work with computers and be a member of the signal corps or be a cook for the soldiers, he may have been a construction worker in civilian life and be a military engineer, he may become a truck driver and serve in logistics, or he may be very good with a rifle and be a sniper in the infantry. There are a lot of jobs that a person can choose to do in the army."
Branches.
There are traditionally six branches of service in the army:
Theology
Theology is the study of one or more religions
"(‘Theo-’ means God in Greek and ’-logy’ is study, which makes it ’God study’ or ’study of God’). Somebody who studies theology is called a theologian. Books or ideas about theology are called theological."
"Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some people study theology to better understand their own religion, while other people study theology so that they can compare religions."
"The word ‘theology’ was first used to describe the study of God in Christianity but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so. Some people use the words 'comparative theology' in reference to approaching theology within more than one religion at once."
"During the High Middle Ages, it was thought that theology was the highest subject learned in universities. Theology at that time was named ""The Queen of the Sciences"". There was a plan for young men to study easy subjects and then harder subjects. The easiest subjects were called the Trivium. The next harder subjects were called the Quadrivium. Finally, young men were expected to study theology. This meant that the other subjects existed primarily to help with theological thought."
Work
"Jasenovac was a complex of five sub-camps covering over on both banks of the Sava River. The largest camp was at Jasenovac, about southeast of Zagreb. The complex included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the Sava River; a children's concentration camp in Sisak; and a Stara Gradiška concentration camp."
"The camp's history website says, ""We cannot be sure of the exact number of victims of the Ustasha camp in Jasenovac. According to research completed so far, the number can be estimated at between 80,000 and 100,000""."
Background.
The Independent State of Croatia (ISC) made three orders in 1941:
"These orders were enforced through the regular court system, and through new special courts and mobile courts-martial with special powers. By July 1941, there were too many new prisoners to fit in the jails that existed. The Ustaše government began building the Jasenovac concentration camp."
"The Independent State of Croatia was created and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Because of this, the ISC took on their ideas about race and politics. Jasenovac had a role in the Nazis' ""Final Solution."" However, the ISC also used the camp for the ethnic cleansing of Romani and Serbian people in Croatia."
The Nazi organizations that directed the Ustaše's death camps were:
"The Nazis encouraged the Ustaše's anti-Jewish and anti-Roma actions and showed support for the anti-Serb policy. Soon, it became clear that the Nazis wanted to commit genocide. In a meeting on July 21, 1941, Hitler said to the Croatian military commander, Slavko Kvaternik:"
"The Jews are the bane of the human kind. If the Jews will be allowed to do as they will, like they are permitted in their Soviet heaven, than they will fulfill their most insane plans. And thus Russia became the center to the world's illness... if for any reason, one nation would endure the existence of a single Jewish family, that family would eventually become the center of a new plot. If there are no more Jews in Europe, nothing will hold the unification of the European nations... this sort of people cannot be integrated in the social order or into an organized nation. They are parasites on the body of a healthy society, that live off of expulsion of decent people. One cannot expect them to fit into a state that requires order and discipline. There is only one thing to be done with them: To exterminate them. The state holds this right since, while precious men die on the battlefront, it would be nothing less than criminal to spare these bastards. They must be expelled, or -- if they pose no threat to the public -- to be imprisoned inside concentration camps and never be released."""
Creation of the camp.
"The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Bročica, were closed in November 1941."
The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war:
"The camp was built, managed and supervised by Department III of the ""Ustaška Narodna Služba"" or ""UNS"" (lit. ""Ustaše People's Service""), a special police force of the ISC. Vjekoslav ""Maks"" Luburić was head of the UNS. At different times, Miroslav Majstorović and Dinko Šakić managed the camp."
"The Ustaše interned, tortured and executed men, women and children in Jasenovac. The largest number of victims were Serbs, but other victims included Jews, Bosnian Muslims, Gypsies, and Croatian resistance members opposed to the ISC regime. When they got to the camp, the prisoners were marked with colors: blue for Serbs, and red for ""communists"" (non-Serbian resistance members). Gypsies had no marks (this was later changed)."
"Most people who were sent to Jasenovac were killed at execution sites near the camp: Granik, Gradina, and other places. Prisoners who were kept alive were mostly people who had special skills (for example, doctors, pharmacists, electricians, shoemakers, and goldsmiths). They were forced to work at Jasenovac."
Living conditions.
"The living conditions in the camp were terrible, as was usual for Nazi death camps. Prisoners were fed very little, not given enough clothing or shelter to stay warm, had no health care, and were abused by the Ustaše guards. Also, as in many camps, conditions would be improved temporarily when special groups visited. For example, when members of the press visited in February 1942, and later when a Red Cross delegation visited in June 1944, the prisoners were treated better until the visitors left. Then the living conditions would go back to usual."
Food.
"Like at all Nazi death camps, the food given to prisoners at Jasenovac was not enough to keep them alive. The kind of food they were given changed over time. In camp Brocice, inmates were given a ""soup"" made of hot water with starch for breakfast, and beans for lunch and dinner. (These ""meals"" were served at 6:00, 12:00 and 21:00.) Food in Camp No. III was better at first, with potatoes instead of beans. However, in January, prisoners started getting only one daily serving of thin ""turnip soup"". By the end of the year, the diet had been changed again, to three daily portions of thin gruel made of water and starch. More changes were made, but prisoners never got enough food to keep them from starving."
Water.
"The water at Jasenovac was even worse than at most death camps. There was no clean water at the camp. Prisoners were forced to drink water from the Sava River, which was contaminated with ""hren"" (horseradish)."
Shelter.
"In the first camps, Brocice and Krapje, inmates slept in regular concentration-camp barracks. These were made of wood and had three tiers (levels) of bunks."
"In Camp No. III, which housed about 3,000 prisoners, there was not enough shelter for everyone. At first, inmates slept in the attics of the camp's workshops, in an open depot used as a railway ""tunnel"", or simply outside in the open. A short time later, eight barracks were built. Inmates slept in six of these barracks. The other two were used as a ""clinic"" and a ""hospital."" These were not places where inmates could get medical treatment and get better. They were places where sick inmates were put together to die or be killed."
Forced labor.
"As in all concentration camps, prisoners at Jasenovac had to work about 11 hours a day. They did hard, forced labor, and were always watched by the Ustaše guards. These guards would execute inmates even for small reasons, and say the inmates were ""sabotaging labor."""
"Ustasas Hinko Dominik Picilli and Tihomir Kordić controlled the labor section. Picilli would personally whip inmates to make them work harder. He divided the ""Jasenovac labor force"" into 16 groups, including groups of construction workers, brick-workers, metal-works, and agricultural workers. Many inmates died from the hard work. Brick-working was especially hard and dangerous. Inmates working as blacksmiths were forced to make knives and other weapons for the Ustaše. Building dikes was the most feared job of all."
Sanitation.
"Inside the camp, there was no sanitation. Prisoners had no way to keep things clean, and had to live in terrible conditions. Blood, vomit and dead bodies filled the barracks. The barracks were also full of pests like lice and rats, which spread disease. The barracks smelled terrible because inmates had to use a bucket for a toilet during the evenings. The bucket often spilled."
"During breaks from work (from 5:00-6:00; 12:00-13:00, and 17:00-20:00), inmates were allowed to empty their bowels in public latrines. These were big pits that lay bare in the open field, covered with planks of wood. Inmates often fell inside and died. The Ustaše encouraged this by having prisoners separate the planks. Sometimes, the Ustaše would even drown inmates inside the pits. When it rained, these pits would overflow and drain into the lake. This meant that urine and feces would mix into the water which the prisoners had to drink."
"Inmates were given rags and blankets, but they were very thin. The barracks were also not enough to keep inmates warm from the cold. Prisoners' clothes and blankets were rarely cleaned. Inmates were allowed to wash them quickly in the lake once a month, except during the winter, when the lake froze. Then, inmates were sometimes allowed to boil a few clothes, but not well enough to get them clean."
"Because of these terrible living conditions, inmates suffered from illnesses that led to epidemics of typhus, typhoid, malaria, lung infections, influenza, dysentery, and diphtheria."
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
"And,"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,"
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.
Vulcans age a lot better
"Well, yeah,"
"he didn't look too bad, did he?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, uh, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK"
Imagine that.
"Yeah,"
that's amazing.
"But, did they have some pretty good special effects?"
"Oh, excellent, excellent special effects."
"But I think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one."
"Yeah,"
"FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad"
"Well, you know why?"
"No,"
I don't.
Why?
"Uh, William Shatner wrote it."
"Oh, is that right?"
"And even worse, he directed it."
"Uh,"
"Leonard, Nimoy, he does a lot better."
"Oh, yeah,"
"he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one."
He produced this one
"But he directed the one before, uh, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that."
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
"I, uh, know the name"
but I haven't been there.
"Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant."
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
"Uh, I went to the Naval Academy."
"Oh, the U S ,  Naval Academy?"
"And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty."
Uh-huh.
"And,"
"yeah,"
"we would go over there to, uh,"
"pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders"
"I think it was,"
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
"Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,"
"but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,"
"and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy"
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
"Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?"
"I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has."
"Yes, sir."
"My dad worked there for years, and years."
Uh-huh.
"That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando."
"So,"
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"no,"
"I watch those if I,"
"but my husband likes to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which I'm not,"
"Oh, see, I like sports."
"No,"
I don't.
"Well, I, I do, I like ice skating"
"and I like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,"
Uh-huh.
"but I, I,"
and I'll watch snippets of baseball games
"and I, I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing."
Uh-huh.
"And I don't ever, no matter what's on, I don't ever just sit and watch T V."
"I'm usually either doing dishes,"
"or I may be sewing,"
"or, you know, I always have, or letter writing,"
I know.
"or I may be working around in the room somehow,"
"but I don't, I don't ever just sit and,"
"I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know."
"No,"
I don't sit.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
I know.
Who has time?
"I don't have time to sit, I know."
No.
"It's, it's, uh,"
That's why I don't get to watch that much.
"I mean, I, watch nine o'clock"
Right.
"Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land."
"And, of course, it's pretty static right now"
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
How about you?
"Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas."
I'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway.
Okay.
Okay.
"And, I guess we have a similar situation."
"I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand"
Uh-huh.
and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street
"so I don't I don't even know how high those go,"
Okay.
but some of those are pretty big.
"Yes,"
those are over a million.
Yeah
"So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all."
"They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles."
"So,"
"Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas."
Yeah.
"Not as bad as Houston,"
"but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
I've noticed that.
"Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or zero lot home,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, acorn squash are good winter keepers."
Yeah.
"I mean, things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste"
Uh-huh.
"you know, we eat it, we,"
just too much.
"She, she starts her own plants."
She plants a lot of tomatoes
Uh-huh.
"I let her do all the planting and putting,"
"and I, I do a lot of the, uh, a lot of the, the the back work, and stuff."
"But she does, she helps me a lot, too."
Uh-huh.
She puts a lot of financial.
She plans it all out.
Beans like to be near certain types of plants.
"Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, uh, peas,"
I don't know.
"Something,"
"Oh, really"
"because of like the cross-pollination,"
"or,"
"No,"
"it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans."
"I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,"
they just don't like each other.
Huh.
"I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books,"
"so. I wish I knew more to tell you why,"
"but,"
"Huh. My mom put, uh, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,"
and the got cross pollinated by the bees
"and so my transportation costs have gone up by, uh, five times"
"Yeah,"
I understand that.
"We, we have a real similar situation."
"Ours, uh, have quintupled, at least."
So there is a real family budget.
"Yeah,"
"pretty much, um."
The problem is there never seems to be enough money.
"I have three children,"
"and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need,"
"and, uh, of course, nothing ever goes down,"
"I mean, uh, I remember,"
I have five children total.
I have three left in the house.
Yeah.
"And I can remember years ago, when school would start,"
"and I'd go buy all five kids, you know, shoes,"
"and I could get out of the, out of the shoe store without spending more than thirty-five dollars."
"Nowadays, thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes"
If you're lucky.
"yeah,"
"so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last, uh, I guess about the last ten years."
Exempt or nonexempt.
I'm exempt.
"Wow,"
must be nice.
"Part of the high price spread. Uh,"
"no,"
"well, we don't, we do,"
but we don't have a family budget.
We have the fixed things we have to pay.
"He was pretty good,"
"but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age."
You can't play football at fifty-five.
Right.
"But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh,"
anything can be warped.
Yeah.
"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely."
Uh-huh.
Something to stay active at for a long time.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years."
"Yeah,"
and they can still get good at it.
"That's right,"
that's absolutely right.
"And it's something that,"
"Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on,"
"Yeah,"
"when you're too old to do anything else go play golf,"
Yeah
yeah
"But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in"
Uh-huh.
"or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles."
True.
"You know, you can go to the country club together."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's probably a good thing.
It's probably the safest thing.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum"
Yep
and simple majority won't do.
No.
"And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"yeah,"
quorums are to easy to get.
Yep.
"And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know."
"So it's, it's"
definitely
"but, uh, I don't know."
"I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing."
Yeah.
Like Gives them a little too much power
Yeah
"I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently."
"But, uh,"
"Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict"
"but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons"
Yeah.
"About the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit"
Yeah.
"but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that"
and  that's what the trial by jury.
"You can play with your friends,"
"he can play with his friends,"
"but you've both been out and exercised,"
and you have enjoyed the day.
"Right,"
yeah.
"Or my favorite,"
just ride around in the cart with him
"You bet,"
you get a lot of exercise that way.
"Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, I'll tell you what, if if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long."
"Oh, yeah."
"But my husband's pretty tolerant,"
so he's not too bad to watch.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, mine had a very short fuse."
"If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it."
"Oh, no,"
yeah.
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.
"I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal."
Gosh.
"Now my husband has a temper,"
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.
"He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
So I guess he's real laid back about it.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, I see."
"uh, but, uh, we did a lot of fishing when we were up there."
"But down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing."
"I can't remember what the name of the lake is,"
and he was just here this past weekend.
"I could have,"
"I, I think he mentioned it again,"
but I couldn't remember what it was.
"Uh, I want to call it Salt Fork, or Lake Fork."
"I, I can't remember,"
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.
"Oh, oh, oh, uh, I think I know where, uh, Lake Caddo, or something like that."
"I, you know,"
that may be it.
That may be it.
"If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and he said that he has never gone anywhere before,"
"and he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen."
So I would love to go over there.
"They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,"
"and I was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing, and, uh, and catch some bass."
"I would love to do that,"
"but they have snakes over there,"
"and I'm not too welcome around,"
"I don't, I really don't want to share a boat with a snake."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I just, I, I, I don't see it."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
okay.
I think Florida still uses electric chair.
Yeah
"Uh, I don't, I don't know."
In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God.
Yeah.
"And that's not,"
I don't think that's right.
"But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it."
Yeah.
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
"and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um,"
Yeah.
with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year.
"They,"
Yeah.
That's what's happening here.
"There is,"
"like, uh, that's,"
"in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, uh, uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"And it's like, you know, that's a big problem"
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
Uh-huh.
"and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a a big problem."
Yeah.
"Uh, go ahead."
"I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't."
Right.
"Be a little more, you know,"
"and that's the other issue. Uh,"
the pitch and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well and thread,"
"Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,"
"but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie."
I haven't seen that yet.
"I, I, I hear,"
"we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it."
"It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess."
So we're going to go see that.
But you enjoyed that?
"Yeah,"
"it's, it's something that, uh,"
"my brother lives over in Fort Worth,"
"and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,"
"and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video."
"And I said, no,"
this is not one that you want to do that with.
"That's what I heard,"
yeah.
"It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen."
"It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,"
"it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture."
"Yeah,"
"I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos."
"No,"
"it's one I think,"
"but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,"
this is my favorite movie.
"Well, this is the one for me this time."
"the monotonous the monotonous,"
yeah.
no
"that's not,"
"I don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about, well, I'm better than you, and blah, blah, blah."
Uh-huh.
I don't like that.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I like the funny, satire,"
"and then some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in urban society."
Yeah.
It really does.
"It talks about, um, race relations and police relations"
"and, um, that, that"
I guess I don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I'm, with you though,"
I like classical
Uh-huh.
"um, I don't like to listen to it all the time, but, um, some of the time, anyway."
"I like easy listening, just kind of, you know,"
I guess I don't care much for rock and roll any more.
"I used to like it all right,"
but I don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason.
"Um, let's see."
"Country western, uh, I'm not quite as big on that."
"Some of it's okay, uh"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's about my opinion of that"
yeah
"It's, it's okay, um,"
"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men."
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved"
"but, uh, they really were helpful, I know, to our house."
"It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it"
Yeah
Yes
That's awful.
"Um, Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting."
We've got a scout coming up
"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets,  and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that."
Huh-uh.
"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son"
"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather,"
"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there,"
and we took down that paneling
and he helped me
"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him. And, uh, and, uh, help putty up the holes together and, and do things,  like that."
Huh-uh.
"How does the paneling,"
"it looks lots better than,"
do you like it better?
"Oh, I like it so much better."
It makes it so much lighter.
Yeah.
"You know, it really does."
"You know, and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked,  much better, too."
Huh-uh.
That's nice.
It's been fun.
"Nice to have it come out positive and look,  look good."
Yeah.
one paycheck went into savings
"and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills"
Right.
"and it,"
"and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty"
"and, you know. But my wife likes to spend."
"She enjoys,"
so that's fine
But a
"for savings , I'll have to look into that."
Yeah.
"that's, that's been our godsend, you know."
Huh-uh.
"We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,"
"we also own our own house,"
Huh-uh.
"um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible."
Yeah.
"I mean, half the city owned trees ."
One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.
"Oh, really, because of the heavy ice."
Yeah.
It broke the limbs.
Exactly.
Huh-uh.
"We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,"
"but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken."
Right.
"Plus, we went with a friend,"
"and they said you know,"
"and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it."
Yeah.
"That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family."
"Yeah,"
Is it really?
Yeah.
except that mine are a little bit older
"and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,"
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.
Uh-huh.
You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.
That's right.
That's right.
"Well, that's what she said to us."
"She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?"
"And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college."
"And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know."
And that was kind of our view on it.
"It just costs too much,"
"you just can't do it, you know."
"So, I don't know,"
"it's, it's,"
"I don't, uh,"
"it just amazing,"
"it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years."
I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.
"And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them."
"Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,"
"Oh, goodness."
"and I said, that's wonderful."
I applaud that.
"Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a great idea.
"Hell, I'd love to cut ours in half,"
"but, uh"
Uh-huh.
man.
"And if you figure, get with a financial person."
Yeah.
"And you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan, if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment it'll make, uh,"
Uh-huh.
it has a magic with numbers.
"It, I, it'll shave almost, you know, X number of dollars off,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
we we've become aware of that.
"We have a, there's a loan officer through our church, too, that I think could help us better."
"You know, he does that full time with the bank, you know."
Uh-huh.
"And so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know, that, you know, we know are people of integrity."
So.
Sure.
"You know, that is another thing that, you know,"
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time
"we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving, you know,"
"we're going to go to somebody that we know,"
"we're going to take someone with us older,"
and we didn't do any of those things.
Somebody you trust.
"You know, there are so many rip-off artists here in this town."
"It's, it's, uh, it's really a sin,"
it really is.
Yeah.
I got taken on some on firewood.
"it's mainly for flower bed,"
"so I'm not going to, no I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there."
All right.
"But, I,"
"yeah,"
I do want to have a raised bed.
"I've never,"
my flower gardens are always been like on the ground.
Right.
"They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up."
"Well, you can see it a little better"
and it stands out.
"Yeah,"
this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch
"and I can tell you there's nothing around it, cement foundation all the way around it. Not a shrub, not a bush."
Um.
"There was a lilac tree,"
"and the landlord cut it down and said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding"
"And I'm looking at him like, Jeez."
People would kill to have a lilac bush
and he's cutting it down
So. That's all right.
Flower beds are all right.
"Anything, as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding."
"Rub up against the siding. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast."
"Some people, uh, would really like to have them,"
"and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over their lawn."
Uh-huh.
"So, they're kind of a pain,"
"but, you know, people who don't have them think they're great."
I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.
"I think that would be a ,"
Huh-uh.
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.
They could go visit them during the day.
What?
Yeah
"that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children."
"But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit."
Yes
I do.
"Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too."
"You know, go on and pay a lump sum"
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.
"But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay."
"But if you pay out less, then you lose that money."
Um.
"I don't like that part,"
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.
"Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important."
"And then we got that cafeteria plan,"
do you have that?
No.
No.
I don't know what it's about .
"You can, uh,"
"well you,"
"let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance."
It takes it out of your salary before taxes.
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
yeah
They don't make mistakes.
That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive
Right.
and they were not.
"And I haven't heard of any,"
now I'm not in personnel or anything.
Yeah.
"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not."
"In other words, there's very few mistakes,"
"and that, of course, has got to be critical."
"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program,"
"it's got to be with a very, very good agency."
You don't just have some local group do it.
It's got to be a highly qualified agency.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
not just some doctor's office somewhere.
"No,"
you don't want to do that.
It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.
And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.
"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing."
"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course."
"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere,"
"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us."
Oh really.
Yeah.
"Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,"
or do they fire them right away.
"Oh, no."
They're not fired.
"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program."

"Sir Cuthbert Sidney Wallace, 1st Baronet (20 June 1867 – 24 May 1944) was a British surgeon."
"He was born in Surbiton, Surrey, the youngest son of the Rev. John Wallace and educated at Winchester House School, Haileybury College, 1881–86, and St Thomas's Hospital, London."

"He Zhen was from Wuyuan County, but spent much of his time in Nanjing. He had a wide-ranging influence, and founded the Huizhou (Xingyuang) or Wan (Anhui) school of seal-carving."
"He's work aspired to an antique, ancient appearance, and he was known to chip or otherwise artificially weather his seals to create the impression of age. He created this effect by exploiting natural fracture lines in the stone, or by emphasising the knife-marks made whilst incising the inscription. His calligraphy attempted to echo that of the Han Dynasty, and he used the simplicity of that script to ameliorate the elaborate stylistic flourishes of the popular Yuan-style calligraphy that had previously been used for Ming-era seals."

"Hon. Patrick Perkins, J. P., (10 October 1838 — 17 May 1901), nicknamed Paddy Perkins, was a brewer and politician in colonial Queensland. He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and, later, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council."
"Patrick Perkins was born in a humble cottage on a small farm in the village of Clonoulty near Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was the second son of Thomas Perkins, a farmer, and his wife Ellen (""née"" Gooley). He attended the local National School."
"Thomas and Ellen Perkins and their eight children (including Patrick) immigrated on the ""Persian"", departing Southampton and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 9 April 1854."
"In 1861, he married Mary Ellen Hickey in Victoria. They had four children born in Victoria:Thomas Hector (born 1864); Mary Eveleen, (1867-1942) m. Charles Seymour-Allan; Edgar Colin Francis (born 1868) and Lilly Eleanor Perkins (born 1875) m. Randall Macdonnell, m. George Wilkie Gray. They had two children born in Queensland: Patrick Harold (born 1878) and Helene Cicilia (born 1880, Toowoomba d 1965 Adelaide), Sr Margaret Mary of the Dominican priory, Adelaide."
"Patrick Perkins was a miner and storekeeper on the diggings in Victoria in districts including Ballarat, Bendigo, Woods Point and Jamieson."
"With his brother Thomas, he started breweries in Victoria and Queensland. In 1866, Patrick Perkins started the Perkins Brewery in Toowoomba. In 1872, he later extended his operations to Brisbane with the purchase of the City Brewery in 1872."
"In 1876, Patrick Perkins moved to Queensland in order to manage the Brisbane and Toowoomba breweries."
"Perkins also had interests in property and mining, including the Mount Morgan Mine and coal mining in the West Moreton area."
He was considered a shrewd and successful business man.
"On 9 April 1877, Edward Wilmot Pechey, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the seat of Aubigny, resigned. On 1 May 1877, in a by-election, Perkins was elected in Aubigny, defeating Angus Mackay (the then editor of ""The Queenslander"") by a large majority. He was elected again in Aubigny in the 1878 election and was appointed as Minister of Lands in the First McIlwraith Ministry from 21 January 1879 to 13 November 1883."
"Perkins was elected again in Aubigny in the 1883 election, However, allegations about electoral fraud (including intimidation, bribery, and ballot stuffing) in the Aubigny election started to surface, resulting in a petition to the Governor of Queensland detailing numerous kind of electoral fraud and asking to declare that the Aubigny election was void and that Patrick Perkins was guilty of bribery and corruption. On 21 February 1884, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications ruled the Aubigny election was null and void and called for a by-election. Perkins had denied any involvement in the alleged electoral fraud and the Committee of Elections and Qualifications did not disqualify him from re-contesting the seat, which provoked outrage in some quarters. However, Patrick Perkins announced he would not re-contest the seat as he would be taking a trip to England."
James Campbell was elected unopposed at the resulting by-election on 4 March 1884.
"At the 1888 election, Perkins was elected in the seat of Cambooya on 10 May 1888, which he held until 6 May 1893."
"On 23 May 1893, Perkins was appointed to Queensland Legislative Council from 23 May 1893. Being a lifetime appointment, he served until his death on 17 May 1901."
"In 1883 used his wealth to buy a palatial home at 273 North Quay, Brisbane, which he called ""Aubigny"" after the electorate that first sent him to parliament. The house was originally built in 1870 by Samuel Davis, a Jewish businessman, and included a separate building used as Brisbane's first synagogue. Patrick Perkins used the former synagogue as a billiards room. In 1899, the Perkins family rented the property to the Criminal Investigation Department which used the house as offices and the synagogue as a photography room. In 1906, the house was sold to the Rev. Mother Patrick of the Sisters of Mercy to create the 20-bed Mater Misericordiae Hospital (now a tertiary hospital located at South Brisbane); the former synagogue being the hospital chapel. Once the hospital outgrew the house and relocated to the South Brisbane area where it still operates, the house was renamed ""Loretto"" and used as a hostel for Catholic girls; the former synagogue being the maids' quarters. In about 1939 the house was demolished to make way for the construction of a church for the Church of Christ, Scientist."
"He attended the opening of the first Federal Parliament at the Royal Exhibition Building on 9 May 1901 and caught a chill which developed into bronchial pneumonia, from which he died on Friday 17 May 1901 at ""Ingleborough"", Berkeley Street, Hawthorn."
"On Saturday 18 May 1901, his funeral was conducted at the Roman Catholic church at Glenferrie, after which he was buried in the Boroondara General Cemetery in Kew, Melbourne."

"Yulia Vladimirovna Barsukova (, born 31 December 1978) is a Russian retired individual rhythmic gymnast. She is the 2000 Olympic champion in the All-Around, the 2000 Grand Prix Final All-around champion, the 1999 World All-around bronze medalist, 2000 European All-around bronze medalist and 1999 Grand Prix Final All-around bronze medalist."
"Barsukova began figure skating at age five in the Izmaylovo District of Moscow where she lived. When she was eight years old, she passed a sports club and saw girls practicing rhythmic gymnastics through the window. Her father soon enrolled her in the sport. After three years, she moved to Tagansky District high school's rhythmic gymnastics department."
"Barsukova was coached by Vera Silaeva until she was sixteen, when Silaeva took her student to Russia's head coach, Irina Viner. Viner was unimpressed initially but accepted her at the urging of Russia's national team choreographer, Veronica Shatkova."
"Barsukova began competing at international competitions following the coaching change. For six years she competed under the shadow of other Russian gymnasts, Yanina Batyrchina, Amina Zaripova, Natalia Lipkovskaya and then Alina Kabaeva. Barsukova considered quitting rhythmic gymnastics until Viner persuaded her to stay and be patient. She had her breakthrough in 1998. During an event dedicated to the 15th anniversary of Ballet Magazine, Barsukova performed along with the stars of the theater. She performed her ""Dying Swan"" ball routine and received the unofficial title of ""Miss Bolshoi Theater""."
"Barsukova won many rhythmic gymnastics titles after her emergence in major competitions as a second member of the Russian team. She won gold in hoop at the 2000 World Cup Final in Glasgow and then gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics after a hoop fumble by then-World champion, Alina Kabaeva. She was the 2000 European All-around bronze medalist and won the rope final at the 2000 European Championships (9.983). She was the oldest Olympic champion in rhythmic gymnastics—21 years, 8 months and 27 days—until fellow Russian Evgenia Kanaeva won her second gold medal at London 2012 being aged 22 years, 4 months and 7 days."
"After the Olympics, Barsukova won the all-around title at the Grand Prix Final in Deventer where she also won gold in ball, rope and ribbon final. She retired from competition following the 2000 Aeon Cup. She has participated in Russia's Channel One project ""Stars on Ice""."

"In 2010, the provincial government named the entire highway Mabel and Alexander Graham Bell Way in honour of Mabel Gardiner Hubbard and her husband Alexander Graham Bell, who resided and are buried at Beinn Bhreagh near Baddeck."
"The highway travels northeast from Port Hastings along the base of a group of mountains known as ""The Big Ridge"" to Whycocomagh. It then follows the north shore of Bras d'Or Lake, bypassing Baddeck on a short Super two controlled access segment. Still running in a general northeast direction, at St. Anns the highway begins ascending the west slope of Kelly's Mountain on the Cape Dauphin Peninsula. Highway 105 descends the east slope of Kelly's Mountain using a series of sharp turns including a 180° hairpin turn at New Harris Forks before crossing the Great Bras d'Or Channel of Bras d'Or Lake on the Seal Island Bridge. The road crosses Boularderie Island using another short Super two controlled access segment and then runs southeast as an uncontrolled access road through the villages of Bras d'Or and Florence. Highway 105 regains controlled access for the final to its eastern terminus at the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal in North Sydney where travellers can continue to Newfoundland."
"With some minor exceptions noted above, the highway is two lanes and uncontrolled access. In addition, there are two intersections controlled by traffic lights in Florence."
"The Cabot Trail, which is usually used to describe a different road, is signed along a portion of Highway 105 between Nyanza and St. Anns so that the signed route forms a loop."
"Highway 105 is descended from the former Trunk 5, which no longer exists; Highway 105 follows the old Trunk 5 alignment, using present Routes 205, 305 and roads named after it to serve areas bypassed by Highway 105. The 105 name was applied in 1964<br>"
"Trunk 5 was a provincial trunk road in Victoria County and the Cape Breton Regional Municipality between Boularderie East and Millville Boularderie on Boularderie Island in Nova Scotia. The route, known as Millville Highway, was the main highway before Nova Scotia Highway 105 opened. It originally extended from Sydney River to Port Hawkesbury.

"Crickhowell Castle () is a Grade I listed building in Crickhowell, Wales, now largely ruined. An alternative name, ""Alisby's Castle"", is sometimes used; this is thought to be after a former governor of the castle, Gerald Alisby."
"The remaining sections of the castle walls and motte stand on a spur where a tributary stream meets the River Usk, in a more elevated position than the rest of the town, which was planned around it. It has been suggested that the castle replaced an earlier motte-and-bailey structure at nearby Maescelyn, where St Mary's Chapel, which has existed since around 1300, has also been linked with the castle by some historians. The motte is oval in shape and is still clearly visible, whilst the foundations of the shell keep are largely buried. Traces of the castle bailey have been identified in the nearby playing field."
"The castle was initially a motte and bailey castle built from around 1121, probably by Robert Turberville, a member of the notable Norman family, who at the time was a tenant of the Marcher lord Bernard de Neufmarché. In 1172 it was attacked by Welsh rebels, led by one Seisyllt ap Rhirid. Henry de Turberville (died 1239), the son of another Robert, was Seneschal of Gascony in the years 1226–1231 and again in 1237–1238, and Crickhowell Castle was held at the time by a Richard Turberville. Edmund de Turberville is recorded as lord of Crickhowell later in the century. Hugh Turberville, who held Crickhowell Castle from 1273, not as tenant-in-chief but as mesne lord, also held the position of Seneschal of Gascony. Hugh's services were called upon by King Edward I of England to train Welsh men-at-arms and transform the royal levy into a disciplined medieval army capable of conquering Wales; he led both cavalry and 6,000 infantry recruited in the Welsh Marches for King Edward's forces. He was later Constable of Castell y Bere in Merionethshire. He fought against Rhys ap Maredudd during his rising from 1287 to 1291, and died in 1293, the last of the family in the direct line."
"The castle was refortified in stone from 1242 when Sybil Turberville, Hugh's daughter, married Sir Grimbold Pauncefote (or ""Paunceforte""), who thus gained possession. It was walled with substantial stone towers and a large bailey, a home castle befitting an important Royal ally in Wales. The castle was in the hands of the powerful Mortimer family dynasty of Marcher Lords and in the 14th century and declined as a smaller holding within a large portfolio of lands, titles and larger castles."
"On the Royal command of new King King Henry IV in 1400, it was again refortified, this time by Sir John Pauncefote, great-grandson of Sir Grimbold, in advance of the uprising led by Owain Glyndŵr. The castle was largely destroyed in about 1403 by Glyndŵr's forces. who also attacked and burned Abergavenny town and other settlements in the area. It was at this time that the castle is thought to have been abandoned, subsequent stone-robbing leaving only the ruined stone double tower on Castle Green. However, 19th century illustrations suggest that its condition has deteriorated noticeably in the past century. It was listed in 1963."
"The so-called ""Ivy Tower"", a small tower once thought to have dated from the 14th century and to be part of the castle, was found by an archaeological survey to be much later in date and nothing to do with the castle at all."

He passed his matriculation examination from the Albert School and was subsequently educated at the Scottish Church College, and at the Ravenshaw College, from where he graduated. Subsequently, he studied law at the University of Calcutta."
"During his stay in Calcutta, he came in contact with leaders of the Brahmo Samaj, and was deeply influenced by their vision. In 1885, he joined the bar in the court of Cuttack, where he practised, and went on to become an advocate. He was appointed Government Pleader and later given the title Rai Bahadur, which he relinquished in protest."
"His career as an advocate made him come in contact with various religious, and political personalities of the Indian Independence movement. He passed many of his ideals and values to his 9th son, Subhas, at a very young age."
"Bose was the son of Haranath Bose and Kamini Bose. He was the brother of Jadu Nath Bose, Kedar Nath Bose, Devendra Nath Bose, Tara Prasanna Bose and Surya Prasanna Bose."

= = = Cubohemioctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the cubohemioctahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"It is given Wythoff symbol 4/3 4 | 3, although that is a double-covering of this figure."
"A nonconvex polyhedron has intersecting faces which do not represent new edges or faces. In the picture vertices are marked by golden spheres, and edges by silver cylinders."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 4 hexagonal faces passing through the model center. The hexagons intersect each other and so only triangle portions of each are visible.
"It shares the vertex arrangement and edge arrangement with the cuboctahedron (having the square faces in common), and with the octahemioctahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common)."
"The ""cubohemioctahedron"" can be seen as a net on the hyperbolic tetrahexagonal tiling with vertex figure 4.6.4.6."
<HR>
"The hexahemioctacron is the dual of the cubohemioctahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the octahemioctacron."
"Since the cubohemioctahedron has four hexagonal faces passing through the model center, thus it is degenerate, and can be seen as having four vertices at infinity."
"In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting infinite prisms passing through the model center, cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker."

Darbandokeh is a former Assyrian village located in the sub-district of Harir and in the district of Shaqlawa. It is populated by Kurds today.
"The Assyrians of Darbandokeh came right after the Assyrian genocide that took place within the Ottoman Empire. They came from the Shamezdin region, located within Hakkari, Turkey and are of the Nochiya tribe. In 1938, fifteen families totaling 108 people lived in the village. As a result of forced migration in the late 20th century, today no Assyrians remain in the village of Darbandokeh. The Assyrian quarter of the village was resettled by pro-government Kurds after the entire village's population fled in 1963 due to fighting."
"Darbandokeh is the birthplace of many renowned Assyrians. It is where the Patriarch of the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Dinkha IV, was born. It is also the birthplace of the former Secretary General of the Assyrian Universal Alliance, Emanuel Kamber."
"Asset backed debt has a commodity value equal to the price of the collateral; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid."
"Commodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return."

"The circulation and mass water properties in Bali Sea are a continuation from Flores Sea to the Java Sea in the north. In oceanographic, Bali Sea is concerned with the Indonesian Throughflow coming from Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, the flow of which are mostly passing through Bali Strait and Lombok Strait."
"In a recorded tsunami history, Bali Sea observed several tsunamis. The 1815 Tambora eruption (scale 7 of Volcanic Explosivity Index) formed tsunamis on 22 September 1815 at coordinate and three years later (8 September 1818) from subsequent volcanic activities at coordinate .

= = = Maryland and Delaware Railroad = = =
"The Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company is a Class III short-line railroad, formed in 1977 to operate several branch lines of the former Penn Central Railroad in both Maryland and Delaware, United States. These branches were omitted from the system plan for Conrail in 1976 and would have been discontinued without state subsidies. As an alternative to the higher cost of subsidizing Conrail as operator of the branch lines, the Maryland and Delaware governments selected the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company (MDDE) to serve as the designated operator."
"The railroad did not own any of the track it uses until 2000 when it acquired a line between Frankford, Delaware and Snow Hill, Maryland, from the Snow Hill Shippers Association. Today, the railroad operates on 120 miles of track and runs out of a restored station in Federalsburg, Maryland. The new engine house in Massey, MD, was opened in the fall of 2019."
"MDDE incorporated in the State of Maryland on June 20, 1977 as a closely held, small railroad company. At that time, the states of Maryland and Delaware were paying subsidies to Conrail for branch lines, still owned by Penn Central, serving rural communities."
"The Maryland Department of Transportation selected MDDE to operate three of the rural branch lines in August 1977. These included the current Northern and Seaford Lines, and the discontinued branch between Clayton, Delaware and Easton, Maryland. Maryland purchased the two branches served by the MDDE Northern and Seaford Lines."
Snow Hill Shippers Association purchased the branch currently known as the Snow Hill Line in 1982 and hired MDDE to serve as operator. MDDE became owner of the branch in 2000.
"MDDE was awarded a five-year contract by Delaware in 1994 to operate a branch between Ellendale, Delaware and Milton, Delaware, and another branch between Georgetown, Delaware and Lewes, Delaware. These branches were part of the former Queen Anne's Railroad, which began providing rail service between Queenstown, Maryland and Lewes, Delaware in 1894, and extended its track to Love Point, Maryland in 1902. MDDE did not seek renewal of the Delaware contract and operation of the two lines was returned to the previous contractor, Delaware Coast Line Railroad, in 1999."
The 5-year operating contract with the Maryland Department of Transportation for the North Line and Seaford Line became effective in 2008. Two 5-year renewal options allow the contract to be extended until 2023.
"After years of using part of the Snow Hill branch for tank car storage, active rail service was restored in June 2019 to the Tysons Foods facility."

"Baldwin 60000 is an experimental steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin."
"It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is ."
"60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks."
"This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today."
"After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons."
"Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades."
"In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption."
"On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad."
"In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal."
"Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute."

"The ""Syöksy""-class motor torpedo boats () was a series of four British Thornycroft type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland."
"In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. ""Nuoli"" had the ace of hearts, ""Vinha"" the ace of clubs, ""Syöksy"" the ace of diamonds, and ""Raju"" the ace of spades."
"On 6 July 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead ""Syöksy"" dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond."
"On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. ""Vinha"" was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while ""Syöksy"" made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it."
"On 1 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. ""Syöksy"" torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS ""Meero"", 1,866 tons)."
"On 22 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" sank the Soviet minehunter ""T-41"" (""Kirov"") east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with ""Vinha""."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Nuoli"" participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from ""Sisu"" that sank the target."
"""Syöksy"", ""Vinha"" and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. ""Syöksy"" managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank."

"Microsoft Network Monitor is a deprecated packet analyzer. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ""Bloodhound"") was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team."
Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).
"The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger."
"Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ""Bloodhound"")."

= = = Blas Ruiz = = =
"Blas Ruiz de Hernán González or Blas Ruiz de Fernán González was an explorer from Ciudad Real, Spain."
"In the last decade of the 16th century, along with the Portuguese adventurer Diogo Veloso from Amarante, Blas Ruiz was the first European to ever set foot in Laos."
"Ruiz's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Veloso of Portugal. When Lovek was invaded by Ayautthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the Spanish colony of the Philippines, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the Portuguese colony of Melaka, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek."
"Ruiz and Veloso arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian Elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the Philippines. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else."
"In July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Bias Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Philippino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Bias Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Bias Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. They were both killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Philippinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang."
"There is a wide variety of training media that can be used, ranging from traditional lecture-based teaching to sophisticated simulators. Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas."
"There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful."
Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.
"A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime."
"TST has considerable experience of successfully employing the accepted techniques applied to the development of training systems, including the Systems Approach to Training (SAT) in both the defence and civilian domains using customer specific standards such as JSP 822 where required."
Carrying out all TNA activates in accordance with SAT principles ensures rigorous visibility in each design stage with clear audit trails from the initial Scoping Study through to the recommended solution.

"A T visa is a type of visa allowing certain victims of human trafficking and immediate family members to remain and work temporarily in the United States, typically if they report the crime to law enforcement, and agree to help them in the investigation and/or prosecution of the crime (or crimes) committed against them. It also allows close family members of the victims to come to the United States legally."
"The United States government estimated in 2002 that each year up to 50,000 people are trafficked illegally into the United States, mostly women and children, and are trapped in slavery-like situations. As a response, it enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), which, among other things, allows such people to apply for 3-year temporary visas that lead to permanent resident status. In 2006, Congress modified 8 CFR 214.11(p) to now have the T-visa to be for 4 years. Although 5,000 are available per year, only 2,000 had been issued as of January, 2009. In 2017, there were 8524 cases of human trafficking being reported to National Human Trafficking Hotline. And up to 2018, allowed stay period for people who are granted with T- visa is still 4 years."
Related visas include:
"The first T visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2003. In the table below, the years are Fiscal Years, so for instance the year 2009 refers to the period from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Note that this only counts T visas issued at embassies and consulates outside the United States, and does not include people who changed nonimmigrant status to T status within the United States. The T-1 status is the one most likely to be achieved through change of status within the United States, and therefore T-1 visas are not usually issued."

= = = Vicia villosa = = =
"Vicia villosa, known as the hairy vetch, fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to some of Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state — as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces."
"Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (""Vicia cracca""), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem."
Several subspecies are recognized:
"The species ""Vicia hirsuta"" is also called hairy vetch."
"Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production."
"Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting."
"It is regulated in the state of Florida. Some sources consider it generally invasive in areas with suitable climate for it to out-compete native species, in a manner similar to how cow vetch, ""Vicia cracca"", is regarded. With both vetches, their agricultural usefulness is typically given precedence over concerns regarding potential ecological degradation. Despite being native to part of Europe it is considered an alien or invasive species in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain."

"Arthur N. ""Art"" Rupe (born Arthur Goldberg, September 5, 1917) is an American music industry executive and record producer. He started Specialty Records, noted for its rhythm and blues, blues, gospel and early rock and roll music recordings, in Los Angeles in 1946."
"Born to a Jewish family in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Rupe grew up in the nearby suburb of McKeesport. As a boy, he listened to music sung at a local black Baptist church. He attended college at Virginia Tech, Miami University, and UCLA. During World War II, he worked for a shipbuilding company in Los Angeles. Along the way, he changed his surname from Goldberg to Rupe, which was an ancestral name."
"So we could get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On one side of the central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young painters organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other."
"In the Room 41 we were grouped together – Le Fauconnier, Léger, Delaunay, Metzinger and myself, joined, at the insistence of Guillaume Apollinaire, who was following this organisation with the greatest interest, by Marie Laurencin"
"Le Fauconnier showed his great ""Abondance"". Léger his nudes in a landscape in which volumes were treated following the method of differently shaded areas [zones dégradées] used in architecture or in mechanical models. Delaunay ""Le Tour Eiffel"" and ""La Ville"". Metzinger [Landscape, Nude, Woman's Head and Still Life], Marie Laurencin some canvasses with people in them. Myself – two landscapes and two canvasses with people: ""La Femme au phlox"" and ""Homme nu sortant du bain""."
"That, very precisely, was how Room 41 in the 1911 Indépendants was made up. In the neighbouring room were to be found, if my memory is right, Lhote, Segonzac, Moreau. [...]"
"During the few days it took for the hanging commission to do its work, there was nothing that could have enabled us to foresee the effect our pictures were about to produce on the public at large. The painters and critics who walked around the canvasses were clearly very interested, whether they were for or against. But no-one could have thought there was material there for a scandal. And we the first, who certainly never would have wanted it."
"So we were greatly surprised when, at the preview, the explosion took place. (Albert Gleizes)"
"""The great complaint that was made against us was of being unreadable; people claimed they could 'see' nothing in our pictures"". Gleizes continues:"
"Everyone was crushed into our room, people were shouting or laughing, expressing indignation, protesting, getting up to all sorts of antics, they were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and defended our position and those who condemned it argued with each other... Room 41 was always full."
"In ""Intransigeant"" Guillaume Apollinaire emphasized the importance of what the Cubists were doing and defended them with passion. Louis Vauxcelles in ""Gil Blas"" attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in ""Comoedia, Excelsior, Action"", and ""L'Oeuvre"" were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in ""Paris-Journal"", the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism."
"It was from that preview in 1911 that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. Prior to the Salon des Indépendants of 1911 no one had ever been called a Cubist, not even Braque or Picasso."
"What, by contrast, can be established is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined as it was to the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the ""Indépendants"", during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born in the same way as the word 'Impressionism' in 1872."
"Overnight, Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger and Delaunay had become famous. Virtually unknown the previous evening, their names and profiles were spread not only throughout Paris but throughout France and other countries as well. Gleizes writes:"
"Painting which, until then, had been the concern of only a small handful of amateurs, passed into the public domain and everyone wanted to be informed, to be let into the secret of those paintings which, it seemed, represented nothing, and whose meaning had to be deciphered like a puzzle."
"The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, known today as the Armory Show, was a landmark event in the history of art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries. This massive exhibition was presented in varying forms at three venues—New York (69th Regiment Armory, February 17 – March 15), Chicago (Art Institute of Chicago, March 24 – April 16), and Boston (Copley Society, April 23 – May 14). The exhibition introduced the visual language of European modernism to a wide spectrum of the American public, changing the aesthetic outlook for American artists, collectors, critics, galleries and museums."
"In 1913, Gleizes, along with Archipenko, Picabia, Picasso, the Duchamp brothers and others, introduced Cubism to an American audience at the Armory Show in three major cities, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to ""La Femme aux Phlox"" Gleizes exhibited his 1912 painting ""Man on a balcony"" (no. 196 of the catalogue)."
"Gleizes entries—both of particular importance, had already produced a considerable effect in Paris—practically eclipsed six paintings and a drawing by Picasso, and three paintings by Braque exhibited at the Armory Show."

Hovey was one of a group of Boston businessmen who had provided most of the funding for the American Anti-Slavery Society in the years prior to the American Civil War.
"During and after the war the Hovey fund helped to sustain the Anti-Slavery Society as fund-raising became more difficult and the cost of publishing abolitionist newspapers increased sharply. After slavery in the U.S. was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the fund's continued support assisted the Anti-Slavery Society's campaign for the political rights of the newly freed slaves, playing a crucial role in the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and Fifteenth Amendments, which secured citizenship and voting rights for African Americans."
"A controversy over the fund developed after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified. Hovey's will stipulated that if slavery was abolished before the fund's money was exhausted, the remainder was to be channeled to other specified reform movements, including the women's rights movement. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in 1865, Phillips declared that slavery would not truly be abolished until African Americans secured the right to vote, and he continued to channel much of the fund's money to that cause."

"One prominent Uruguayan woman is Paulina Luisi. Luisi was a leader of the feminist movement in the country of Uruguay. In 1909, she became the first woman in the country to obtain a medical degree and was highly respected. She represented Uruguay in international women's conferences and traveled throughout Europe. She voiced her opinion on women's rights, and in 1919, Paulina started the force for women's rights in Uruguay.

= = = Shriek: An Afterword = = =
"Shriek: An Afterword is a fantasy novel by American writer Jeff VanderMeer. Published in 2006, ""Shriek"" is set in the fictional city of Ambergris, a recurring setting in VanderMeer's work. The novel was written over a period of eight years, owing in part to what the author said, ""[some scenes that are] very personal."""
"Ambergris, named for ""the most secret and valued part of the whale"", is a fantastical urban milieu, explicitly modern and apparently pre-industrial (despite the presence of guns, bombs, and motor vehicles). Ambergris is characterized by grocery stores, post offices, cafés, and vendors (The ""Borges Bookstore"" bears note). The city was built over the land (and quiet protests) of the fungally-adept ""graycaps"", humanoids of uncertain disposition. The inhabitants of Ambergris enjoy a fascination with squid, and celebrate an anarchic annual Festival of the Freshwater Squid."
"""Shriek: An Afterword"" deals principally with two eponymous siblings, Janice and Duncan Shriek. Janice, an ex-society figure and art critic, narrates with great and sometimes dark flamboyance. Duncan, a historian of note, entertains twin obsessions: rival historian Mary Sabon and the mysterious graycaps. The Shrieks figure rather prominently in VanderMeer's collection of Ambergris novellas and short stories ""City of Saints and Madmen"": Duncan narrates the novella ""The Early History of Ambergris"", while Janice's art criticism figures into the World Fantasy Award-winning novella ""The Transformation of Martin Lake""."
"Reviewer of ""The Believer"" noted ""It's not clear what obsesses Jeff VanderMeer more, mushrooms or books. Both appear on almost every page of his new novel Shriek: An Afterword, in which disgraced historian Duncan Shriek seeks to uncover the mystery of a race of mushroom people with mysterious fungal plans, who lurk below the surface of the moss-covered city of Ambergris. VanderMeer's previous novels are part of a fantasy subgenre, often categorized as the New Weird. While Shriek certainly contains fantasy elements, it doesn’t fit into any strictly delineated genre. There are more ideas here than flights of fancy; VanderMeer owes more to Borges than Tolkien."""

"Stokes was born in San Diego, California. He attended Point Loma High School in San Diego, where he was part of a talented high school football team that included quarterback Dan White and lineman La'Roi Glover. The team was coached throughout Stokes' four years by local legend Bennie Edens."
"While attending University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Stokes played for the Bruins football team from 1991 to 1994. His breakout season came in his junior year when he was named the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year. Stokes' junior season was rewarded with a top ten finish in the balloting for that year's Heisman Trophy, being the only junior recognized. Stokes' junior season ended with unanimous All-American recognition by The Sporting News, AP, UPI, and Kodak. Stokes' senior year began as the nation's leading Heisman contender but was quickly sidetracked by a severe upper thigh contusion suffered in the season's first game. Stokes still holds UCLA school records for receiving touchdowns in a season (17 in 1993), receiving touchdowns in a career (28), receiving yards in a game (263 vs. USC in 1992) and receptions in a game (14 vs. Wisconsin, 1994 Rose Bowl), among others."
"On October 9, 2009, Stokes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame."
"Stokes was selected with the first round (tenth overall pick) of the 1995 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, and he played for the 49ers from to . The 49ers traded up 20 spots to the No. 10 pick in the first round of the draft to select Stokes. After a slow start to his rookie season, the former Bruin ultimately netted 38 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was tossed by Jerry Rice."
"During the 1996 season, Stokes suffered a broken hand and missed most of the season, leading to the emergence of the 49ers' third round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, wide receiver Terrell Owens."
"In 1997, with Rice sidelined with a torn ACL, Stokes and Owens formed a formidable duo for quarterback Steve Young, with Stokes hauling in 58 passes for 733 yards and four touchdowns. Once Rice returned, Stokes' production did not falter as he would achieve career highs in receptions (63), yards (770) and touchdowns (eight). Stokes was also the recipient of Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spitting in his face during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in December 1997."
"Along with the rest of the team, Stokes' production dropped in 1999 as a result of Young's career-ending concussion in a Monday night game in Arizona. Football Outsiders called Stokes ""the league's least valuable receiver"" in 1999."
"The 49ers released him in 2003 and he was initially signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars before going to New England. Stokes was rarely used in the Patriots offense, only contributing 15 catches for 154 yards during the 2003 campaign. New England released him and activated fullback Larry Centers near the end of the season. However, he was re-signed by the Patriots prior to the AFC Championship Game."
"He worked as a radio host for the ESPN radio affiliate based out of Modesto, California. Currently, he works as an analyst for Fox Sports on UCLA's football games and for high school football on the internet in Southern California."

= = = Museum Building (Trinity College Dublin) = = =
"The Museum Building is a building within Trinity College. Finished in 1857 and located on the south of New Square, it is home to the University's Geology, Geography, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering departments. It is a Palazzo style building, inspired by Byzantine architecture of Venice, and finished in Lombardo−Romanesque detailing, with over highly decorated 108 carved capitals."
"In 1833 the then Board of the College instigated a competition for a new Museum Building to contain the geological and various other collections which were housed within the large room of Regents House. Tenders were invited for almost twenty years, ending with the design submitted by Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward being accepted in April 1853. At the time however a row with John McCurdy had caused some concerns to the Board."
"On 23 May 1853 a contract for foundations was agreed with Messrs Cockburn & Son builders (for £24,000) and ground was broken some months later. It was during this time that Samuel Haughton (Professor of Geology) undertook an investigation into the suitability of the site due to its close proximity to the Old Library. He reported various layers of made ground, ash pits and calcareous drift, finally deeming the site permissible to build upon."
"The exterior of the building was fully in place by 1855; however, it was not until 1857 that the interior was completed and the building as a whole finished."
"Suitably fitting for a building designed to house a Geology collection, the Museum Building was constructed from a vast number of different and contrasting forms of stone. College tradition holds that it some form of stone from every quarry in Ireland during the time of its construction was used somewhere within the building."
"The exterior walls were first constructed from Calp Limestone, which were then faced with 22.86 cm (9 inches) of Ballyknockan Granite. The quoins, columns and 108 capitals, as well as the string course which can be seen halfway up the building, are all of Portland stone from the Isle of Portland, Dorset. The tympanum over the heavy wooden main door to building and which bears the crest of the College (a popular 19th-century variant, slightly different from the one currently used by the college today) is of Caen stone from Caen, France. Overall the exterior amounted to just under half the cost for the entire building."
"Initially Deane and Woodward had planned for the interior walls to be of rubble which would then be plastered over. However, in early 1855 they submitted a design change to the Board, deciding instead to use Caen Stone, and the Board agreed. However, when they had learnt that only two thirds of the stone had arrived the Board rescinded this permission. After strong argument from Deane, on 4 May they Board overruled their prior decision and agreed to the use of Caen Stone."
"The large domed central hall once again makes heavy use of Irish stone. The Romanesque arches between each column use alternating yellow and red stained blocks which sit upon bases and capitals of heavily carved Portland Stone. The central staircase and floors of the upper balconies are also made of Portland Stone. The original floor was composed of Yorkstone flagstones, further Portland Stone, Welsh Ffestiniog stone, with black squares of black slate, however this floor later relaid."
"The main entrance hall of the building houses fourteen full columns and eighteen half-column made of Irish Marble, although the only true marble is Connemara Serpentine. There had been some problems sourcing the materials needed to have every column complete, which after more petitioning from Deane resulted in the half columns. The only non-Irish stone used in the columns is a dark red Serpentine from Ruan Minor, The Lizard peninsula area of Cornwall."
The known stone from which the columns are made of include:
"Some of the interior room designs by Deane and Woodward were never realised, as the official college architect John McCurdy had convinced the Board otherwise."
"The entirety of the building's carvings are by brothers John and James O'Shea of O'Shea and Whelan who gathered wild flowers to use as models from the college's botanical garden near Ballsbridge. There are seven carvings that relate specifically to Aesop's Fables, and one (considered to be the most important) which refers to Charles Darwin and Evolution."
"College records from May 1860 mention of how the smoggy atmosphere had adversely affected the stone. After years of laying behind sooty deposits the ashlar of the building had become obscured. In 2010 a three-year conservation programme of the Museum Building was begun. Once finished in March 2013, many of the carvings which were almost invisible had been restored to their past state."

"The ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (""Murina cineracea"") , is a species in the vesper bat family Vespertilionidae, found in southern Asia, including Pakistan, northern India, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. They have tube-shaped nostrils (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding."
"The ashy-gray bat is one of 126 new species found in the Greater Mekong region during 2011. There were two other tube-nosed bats found in Southeast Asia in 2011: Beelzebub's tube-nosed bat (""Murina beelzebub"") and Walston's tube-nosed bat (""Murina walstoni""). All three species are small for bats and ""M. cineracea"" is small for a ""Murina"" bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
"The name ""ashy-gray"" comes from the color of their dorsal fur, while the ventral fur is dark gray, and there is some white fur on the breast area. In some areas the tips of the hair are dark. It lacks the golden guard hairs so common in other members of the genus ""Murina"". This bat is small enough to fit in a person's hand, weighing . As of 2013, there are still few details known about them and their ecology and it is suspected there are many more species of bats yet to be discovered in the region."
"Vespertilionid bats have many cryptic species. As an example, the members of the ashy-gray bat were formerly classified as Scully's tube-nosed bat (""Murina tubinaris""). Eight new species were found in Southeast Asia between 2005-2009. The use of DNA technology has proved very useful in differentiating between the various species of ""Murina""."

"Friedenberg is an unincorporated community located in Central Township in Perry County, Missouri, United States."
"The Bavarians who settled just outside Perryville, Missouri in the 1830s felt so strongly about the importance of peace that they named their town “Friedenberg” (German: Hill of Peace). An old nickname for Friedenberg is “Raccoon Ridge”."
"Unlike the communities of Altenburg, Frohna and Uniontown that were settled by Saxon Lutherans from Germany, Friedenberg was founded in 1838 by Lutheran immigrants from Bavaria, Germany. These Bavarians came from the Upper Franconian region, some from the city of Langenstadt near present-day Kulmbach. These immigrants worshiped in members’ homes until a log church was built in 1846 north of Cinque Hommes Creek. From 1852 until 1885 the congregation worshiped at their church on Frankenberg overlooking the Cinque Hommes Bottoms. In 1885 the congregation moved to its present site in Friedenberg and built a brick church. Peace Lutheran church disbanded in 1980."
= = = CBD and South East Light Rail = = =
"The CBD and South East Light Rail is a partly-opened Australian light rail line in Sydney, New South Wales, running from Circular Quay at the northern end of the central business district to the south-eastern suburbs of Randwick and Kingsford. It is part of Sydney's light rail network. Major construction commenced in October 2015. The project is being managed by Transport for NSW. Construction, operation and maintenance of the line is contracted to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium."
"Passenger services between Circular Quay and Randwick, known as the L2 Randwick Line, commenced on 14 December 2019, while services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford, known as the L3 Kingsford Line, are expected to commence in March 2020."
"Since the light rail network's original line opened in 1997, a line through the Sydney central business district had been suggested numerous times but failed to achieve State Government support. This changed in February 2010 when the Keneally Government announced a new line from Haymarket to Circular Quay via Barangaroo. The final route was not decided, with the three options being to send the line north via George Street, Sussex Street or a loop using both."
"When the O'Farrell Government took office in March 2011, it committed to building a line through the CBD to Barangaroo, with a preferred route along George Street. It also committed to conducting feasibility studies into the construction of lines from the City to Sydney University and the City to the University of New South Wales. On 8 December 2011, the government announced shortlisted potential routes for these extensions. In 2012, Transport for NSW (TfNSW) decided the routes to Sydney University and Barangaroo via The Rocks provided fewer customer benefits and were considered a lower priority. A route from Circular Quay to the University of New South Wales via Central station was seen as the best option."
"On 13 December 2012, the government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion line from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade with branches to Kingsford and Randwick. Construction was expected to begin in 2014 and to take five to six years."
The line services areas that were previously served by Sydney's former tram network. Some of the new route follows tram lines of the former network.
The route is mostly on-street but includes an off-street section through Moore Park. The only major engineering works on the line were a new bridge over the Eastern Distributor and a tunnel under Moore Park and Anzac Parade. There will be between eight and ten new traffic light controlled intersections created along the route.
"Several changes to the design were announced in December 2014. The major changes involve revising platform lengths at all stops to support an increase in the length of the trams from 45 metres to 67 metres, redesigning several stops, switching technologies for the delivery of the wire-free section and the removal of a proposed stop at World Square. It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion. The government claimed the increase was due to the design modifications, but a 2016 report produced by the Audit Office of New South Wales found that the increase was largely due to TfNSW underestimating the cost of the project."
"A pedestrian zone was established along approximately 40% of George Street, between Bathurst and Hunter Streets."
"The section between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay is wire-free, with trams using Alstom's proprietary ground-level power supply technology to run instead. This was originally to have been achieved by equipping the trams with batteries and providing recharging facilities at stops."
"The line is designed to handle special events in the Moore Park precinct and at Randwick Racecourse. Events at Moore Park were initially planned to be served using two coupled trams long, with double length platforms at the Central Station and Moore Park stops. Following the decision to make all tram vehicles operate in coupled pairs with a total length of , the plans to build double length platforms at Central and Moore Park were abandoned, and platforms of all stops will be long."
"A depot for the trams was built at the north-western corner of Randwick Racecourse, providing stabling facilities and allowing light maintenance. Heavy maintenance will be conducted at the Lilyfield Maintenance Depot at the site of the former Rozelle Yard. The maintenance depot will be accessed via the Inner West Light Rail."
"The line was built as a public-private partnership (PPP), with the contract covering detailed design, major construction, operation and maintenance of the line as well as the provision of rolling stock. A contract for early construction works was awarded to Laing O'Rourke in July 2014."
"In February 2014, three consortia were short listed for the main contract – covering the construction and operation of the line:"
The iLinQ consortium withdrew after Balfour Beatty pulled out. Balfour Beatty was reportedly concerned about cost overruns for the project and falling profitability of the company as a whole.
"There are other ways to collect award miles when not travelling. The Lufthansa Miles & More Credit Card can be subscribed to (which may be issued as a VISA, MasterCard or American Express card, depending on the country in which it is issued) and at least one award mile for every two Euro spent. A one-time sign-up bonus is given and sometimes introductory promotions may apply, such as double or triple award miles for an introductory period."
"Award miles can be earned on certain Deutsche Bahn trains, when staying in certain hotels, shopping in certain shops (such as the LH Worldshop), renting cars, investing in certain funds, opening an account with certain banks, picking up a catalogue in a Bang & Olufsen store, and others."
"For all offers see Miles & More website as offers vary between countries. However, all these offers do not earn any status miles."
"Once a member has collected the necessary number of miles, they can be used to buy flights, upgrades and products from the Lufthansa Worldshop (offer restricted to residents of some countries only)."
"Miles in a member's account can be exchanged for award flights on all the fully integrated airline partners and all of the Star Alliance carriers. The number of miles that is deducted from the account depends on the origin and destination of that flight. The number of miles that is required can be checked in this file. Additional fees and taxes will still apply for award flights (but can be paid by additional miles). Since the beginning of 2017, with “Cash & Miles” members have been able to use miles flexibly for their flights, and thus, to reduce the amount of money to be paid."
Lufthansa does add fuel surcharges hidden as fees on award tickets. This is prohibited for US based carriers. A transatlantic award flight (regardless which airline is actually flown) with Miles and More can cost up to 500 EUR in additional taxes and fees whereas the same itinerary booked with the US based Star Alliance partner (United) and their miles would cost less than 100 EUR in fees and taxes (even if the itinerary involves Lufthansa aircraft). So Miles and More may have a much lower value than US based Miles.
"In September 2016, Miles & More adjusted the flight award table, thereby reducing the international / national surcharge per flight distance for domestic European premium flights. Miles & More thereby takes over a part of the regular surcharge. Participants now pay €5 instead of €35 in economy classes and €20 instead of €43 in business class with Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, SWISS and brussels airlines. The number of miles required for a flight award inside Europe was adjusted slightly, increasing by 5,000 award miles for return flights."
"Miles can be redeemed for upgrades on all fully integrated carriers of Miles & More and on the following Star-Alliance partners: All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Condor Airlines, Singapore Airlines, TAP Portugal, Thai Airways International, United Airlines. Again the number of miles required depends on the destination of the flight. The exact number is found on . Passengers are only allowed to upgrade one class of service. Only certain booking classes qualify for upgrades."
"Miles can be redeemed for rental car, hotel, shopping, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries etc. Moreover, the Miles & More GmbH also continues to expand its offers in relation to travel. The hotel booking portal Miles & More Hotels already makes it easier for users to book the accommodation they need quickly, giving members the opportunity to earn at least 1,000 miles per night or to redeem their miles. In addition to this, the Miles & More rental car service allows members to redeem miles to book rental cars. Avis car rental in US costs 47,000 miles at the minimum, finding a Hilton hotel and shorting the list based on miles is impossible, selection of hotels in Best Western is very limited (The hotels are available in Best Western but most of the hotels in the list in US are NOT available for miles)."
"Members of the programme also earn award miles when paying their purchases with their Miles & More credit card. Holders of the Miles & More Credit Card Gold benefit furthermore from unlimited mileage validity. Programme members use more than 1.4 million Miles & More Credit Cards in Germany and 22 additional countries, primarily in Europe, America and Asia."
On Miles & More all customers can build status through collecting status miles. The status miles from 1 year only count towards status. Status is important as there are many privileges and advantages that status holders receive (such as priority check-in).
There are four status levels on Miles & More:
"This is the normal status that everybody gets after they join the program. This status does not receive any officially documented privileges. A Miles & More member starts with a temporary paper-card, which is usually cut out from one of the Lufthansa magazines or printed from the internet; a plastic card is sent once the member has credited at least one award mile to their Miles & More account."
"The frequent traveller card is given to all Miles & More customers that received a total of over 35,000 status miles or had 30 flights. This status remains valid for two years and a member can requalify in any one of those two years. All status cards expire in February of the third year, i.e. if status is earned in November 2009, the status will be valid until February 2012."
As a frequent traveller a passenger receives a number of privileges:
"Having collected 100,000 Status Miles within one calendar year, Miles & More members will receive ""Senator"" Status with a validity of at least two years."
The main benefits of Senator status are:
"Having collected 600,000 HON Circle Miles within two calendar years, Miles & More members receive HON Circle Status with validity of two years."

"In 1898 McLaren married Leila Evelyn Landon, who died in 1904. He married Ethyl Mary Wilson in 1910 despite the advice of Baden-Powell, who considered her below his station."
"McLaren had schooled at Harrow and studied at Sandhurst before joining his regiment, the 13th Hussars in 1880. He was posted to India, where he served as regimental adjutant and later aide de camp to General Baker Russell. In South Africa he was gravely wounded at the Siege of Mafeking in March 1900, and taken prisoner by the Boers. He was created a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1900."
"McLaren played polo throughout his military service, and was umpire of one of the two matches in the 1908 London Olympics."
"McLaren first met Baden-Powell (also a 13th Hussars officer) in 1881. Although McLaren was 20 at the time, Baden-Powell nicknamed him ""the Boy"", on account of his appearance. The two became fast friends, their relationship being one of the most important friendships in Baden-Powell's life."
"McLaren was recalled to military service in World War I, but retired again in 1915 due to ill-health."
"McLaren was one of the staff at Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island Scout camp in 1907. Baden-Powell convinced McLaren to be his first manager at the C. Arthur Pearson Limited office of ""The Scout"" magazine but McLaren resigned that position in March 1908."

"As there are no known structures surviving from that period in the Scatterville vicinity, the Scatterville Cemetery is locally significant as the best surviving link to this important early Clay County settlement which faded from view in the post-railroad era. The Scatterville Cemetery comprises roughly two acres and is set in an impressive stand of largely oak and hickory trees. The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973."
"Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved. The inscriptions on many gravestones have been obscured by age and the elements while others were never inscribed. There are a few styled markers, including two four-sided family monuments with obelisks belonging to the Allen and McNiel families.

"The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way."
"A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (""Gili Ulisvsdanvyi"") ""Where the dog ran""."
"Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the ""Silvery River"" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the ""Seventh Night"" (, and )."
"In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor)."
"Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called ""The Pathway of the Birds"" (, ). The Finns observed that migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed ""Lintukoto"" (bird home) was."
"In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Ukko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter."
"The name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, )."
"In the Babylonian epic poem ""Enûma Eliš"", the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted."
"The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας ""Galaxias"") is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, ""gala""). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way."
"Another version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way."
"A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the ""Poeticon astronomicon"" (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), or Opis, the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way."
"In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called ""śiśumãra cakra"", the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called ""Akasaganga"" which means ""The Ganges River of the Sky""."
"According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk)."
"In Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was ""Bealach na Bó Finne"" — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as ""the Great Silver Yoke"" and the ""White Marrow of Fedlimid,"" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (""Mór-Chuing Argait"", ""Smir Find Fedlimthi"")."

"The Scots Confession (also called the Scots Confession of 1560) is a Confession of Faith written in 1560 by six leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. The was the first subordinate standard for the Protestant church in Scotland. Along with the Book of Discipline and the Book of Common Order, this is considered to be a formational document for the Church of Scotland during the time."
"In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland agreed to reform the religion of the country. To enable them to decide what the Reformed Faith was to be, they set John Knox as the superintendent over John Winram, John Spottiswoode, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row, to prepare a Confession of Faith. This they did in four days. The 25 Chapters of the Confession spell out a contemporary statement of the Christian faith as understood by the followers of John Calvin during his lifetime. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox."
"While the Parliament approved the Confession on 27 August 1560, acting outside the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh to do so, Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, refused to agree, and the Confession was not approved by the monarch until 1567, after Mary's overthrow. It remained the Confession of the Church of Scotland until it was superseded by the Westminster Confession of Faith on 27 August 1647. However, the confession itself begins by stating that the Parliament ""ratifeit and apprevit [the confession] as wholesome and sound doctrine grounded upon the infallible truth of God's word""; thus, though changes within societies may have diminished its relevance, believers hold that the authority of its statements is rooted not in parliamentary approval but in, as it says, ""the infallible truth of God's word"". In 1967, it was included in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s ""Book of Confessions ""alongside various other confessional standards, and remains in the current Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s ""Book of Confessions""."
"As the Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1560, the Confession remains part of Scots law."
= = = Gilbert Ashwell = = =
"Gilbert Ashwell (July 16, 1916 – June 27, 2014) was a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health in the United States. He is a member of the National Academy of Science for his work with Anatol Morell in isolating the first cell receptor."
"Ashwell was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1916. After high school, he went to college to further his education. He attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his B.A.in 1938 and M.S. in 1941. He then went to Columbia University in New York, which was closer to his hometown, to spend two years doing research. In 1950, Ashwell joined the National Institute of Arthirtis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases. This Institute had grown and later split into two institutes, which are the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Ashwell worked at the latter as an emeritus scientist after his retirement."
"Ashwell’s goal as a researcher was to devise a labeling serum glycoproteins in order to study the role of ceruloplasmin in Wilson disease. With another researcher named Anatol G. Morell, he worked to propose that membrane lectins remove senescent circulating glycoproteins, and discovered one of the earliest known carbohydrate receptors. They were able to devise a labeling procedure which allowed them to remove enzymes of the glycoproteins' sialic acid residue. By completing this process, they were able to incorporate other substances into the protein. In 1974, Ashwell and Morell happened to discover that a certain receptor in a human’s liver is able to recognize a specific glycoprotein called asialoglycoprotein. Ashwell explained that he was not specifically looking for the asialoglycoprotein when he found it."
"Ashwell died on June 27, 2014 from pneumonia in a Washington, D.C. area hospital. He was 97."
= = = Gogaji = = =
"Gogaji (also known as Goga, Jahar Veer Gogga, Gugga, Gugga Pir, Gugga Jaharpir, Gugga Chohan, Gugga Rana, Gugga Bir and Raja Mandlik) is a folk deity, worshipped in the northern states of India especially in Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab region, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Gujarat. He is a warrior-hero of the region, venerated as a saint and a 'snake-god'."
"Although there are references to him in the folklore of Rajasthan, little historical knowledge of Gugga exists other than that he ruled the small kingdom of Dadrewa (in present day Rajasthan) and was a contemporary of Prithviraj Chauhan."
"According to legend, Goga was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who gave 'Gugal' fruit to Goga's mother Bachhal which was used to name him. Another belief is that he was called Goga because of his remarkable service to cows(Gou in Sanskrit)."
"Goga had a kingdom called Bagad Dedga near Ganganagar that spanned over to Hansi near Hisar in Haryana and included territory up to the river Sutlej in Punjab. It is believed that Goga lived during the 12th Century AD In the past, the river Sutlej flowed through the district of Bathinda in present-day Punjab in India. The capital was at Dadrewa near Ganganagar."
"Goga () (Rajasthani: (Gugo) गुग्गो) was born in c. 900 AD to queen Bachchal (the daughter of a Rajput ruler, Kanwarpala who in 1173 AD ruled over Sirsa in present-day Haryana) and king Zewar in Dadrewa of the Chauhan Clan in the Churu district of Rajasthan. The earliest parts of Goga's life were spent in the village of Dadrewa, situated on Hissar—Bikaner highway in Sadulpur tehsil of Churu district in Rajasthan. According to other legends, his father was Vachha Chauhan, the Raja of Jangal Desh, which stretched from the Sutlej to Haryana."
"When Bachal was worshipping Gorakhnath, her twin-sister decided to usurp the blessings from the Gorakhnath. In the middle of the night, she wore her sister's clothes and deceived Gorakhnath into giving her the blessing fruit. When Bachal came to know about it, she rushed to Gorakhnath and said that she had not received anything. To this, Gorakhnath replied that he had already given his blessings and said that her sister was attempting to deceive her. After repeated requests by Bachal, Gorakhnath relented and gave her two Gugal candies. She distributed these candies to ladies having no child, including the 'blue mare' who was pregnant at that time. When the Guru gave the blessing to Bachal, he foretold that her son would become very powerful and would rule over the other two sons of their aunt, Kachal."
Goga was married to Shreeyal Roz who was daughter of Tandul Nagari's King Sindha Singh.
Another story is that Arjan and Sarjan were against Goga and was a part of conspiracy with king Anangpal Tomar of Delhi. King Anganpal attacked bagad region with Arjan and Sarjan. Both of them were killed by Goga. Goga spared the king after his miserere. In a quarrel about land he killed his two brothers on which account he drew upon himself the anger of his mother.
"The cult of Goga falls within folk religion and therefore his followers include people from all faiths. Goga is popular as a Devta who protects his followers from snakes and other evils. He has been deified as a snake demigod and is a prominent figure among those who follow the Nāga cult in what is now Rajasthan and since the seventeenth century has been worshipped in the Western Himalayas also, possibly as a consequence of migration there from Rajasthan."
"He is particularly popular among those engaged in agrarian pursuits, for whom the fear of snakebite is common. Although a Hindu, he has many Muslim devotees and is chiefly considered to be a saint (""pir"") who had the power to cure the effects of poison (""jahar"")."
"He was reputed to be a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath. According to Muslim oral tradition prevalent in Punjab, he learnt the way of entering and leaving solid earth by a Muslim Pir Hazi Rattan of Bathinda. Goga is also believed to have lived for some time in Bathinda."
"The cult is prevalent in Rajasthan and other states of northern India, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the north western districts of Uttar Pradesh. His followers can also be found in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh."
"His shrine, referred as medi (shortened colloquial term for Samādhi), consists of a one-room building with a minaret on each corner and a Hindu grave inside, marked by a Nishan (a symbol or sign), which is made up of a long bamboo with peacock plumes, a coconut, some colored threads and some handpankhas with a blue flag on the top."
"Worship of Goga starts in Bhaadra month of Hindu calendar. On the 9th of Bhadra, the people worship his symbol, a black snake painted on a wall. Worshippers take a fly-flap, known as chhari, round the village. Devotees pay their respect to it and offer churma. The Savayians sing devotional songs known as ‘Pir ke Solle’ in his honour to the accompaniment of deroos. Beating of deroos is the exclusive privilege of the Savayian community; others may sing, dance or offer charhawa. It is believed that the spirit of Gugga temporarily takes abode in the devotee dancer who lashes himself with a bunch of iron chains. People also open their rakhis on this day(bhadra krishna paksh navmi) and offer them to him. They also offer sweet puri (a type of sweet chappati) and other sweets and take his blessing."
"Grand fairs are held at samadhi sathal Gogamedi. Gogamedi is 359 km from Jaipur, in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. It is believed that Goga went into samādhi at Gogamedi. Thousands of devotees gather to pay homage at this memorial annually in the month of Bhadrapada during the Goga fair, which lasts for 3 days. The fair is held from the ninth day of the dark half of Bhadrapada (Goga Navami) to the eleventh day of the dark half of the same month. People sing and dance to the beats of drums"
"with multicoloured flags called ""nishans"" in their hands. The songs and bhajans on the life history of Gogaji are recited accompanied by music played with traditional instruments like Damru, Chimta, etc. At his birthplace Dadrewa, the fair goes on over a month. Devotees from far eastern places of Dadrewa start arriving from the beginning of the auspicious month of Bhaadra. These devotees are commonly known as purbia (those who belong to east). It is a common sight to see people with snakes lying around their necks. According to a folklore in and around his birthplace Dadrewa it is believed that if someone picks up even a stick from johra (a barren land which has a sacred pond in Dadrewa), it would turn into a snake. Devotees of Gogaji worship him when they get a snake bite and apply sacred ash (bhabhoot) on the bite as an immediate remedy."
"In Thaneek Pura, Himachal Pradesh, a very large scale festival and fair is organized on Gugga Navami. The tale of Gugga Ji is recited, from Raksha Bandhan to Gugga Naumi, by the followers who visit every house in the region. These followers while singing the tales of Gugga Ji carry a Chhat (a wooden umbrella) and people offer them grains and other stuff. They bring all the collected offerings to the temple and then the grand festival of Gugga Navami is celebrated for three days. Apart from various pujas and rituals, the wrestling competition (Mall or Dangal) is organized for three days where participants from all over the region compete. The annual three-day fair is also a part of these festivities where people come and enjoy great food, and shop for decorative items, handicrafts, clothes, cosmetics, household goods, and toys for children."
"Goga is known as Gugga in the Punjab who has a significant following. Many Punjabi villages have a shrine dedicated to Gugga. A fair is organised annually in the village of Chhapar and is known as the Chhapar Mela. Gugga's legacy in Punjab can be seen in towns such as Bareta Mandi, which is situated at a distance of 51 km from Mansa in Punjab. ""The town is predominantly inhabited by Chauhans who trace their origin from Gugga, ‘Lord of Snakes’. It is said that nobody has ever died here on account of snakebite because of the blessings of Gugga."""
"The amateur division of the show known as the Competitive Classes often have an assigned theme, related to the overall show theme. The 2007 Show, Legends of Ireland, featured Pressed Plant Material (i.e. dried flower pictures) that ""incorporated a Celtic Knot."" The first weekend's Medium Niche theme was ""Wish You Were Here"" ""Exhibitors will be sent Irish postcards for inspiration. A copy of the postcard will be mounted next to the exhibit."" Entrants for that class typically have a mockup of the niche at home, where they practice assembling and lighting their entry in the months preceding the show. In a ""Challenge"" class, entrants bring only pruning shears, and must use show-provided materials to interpret a theme within a limited amount of time. Three typical ""Horticulture"" classes are 142: ""Clivia, flowering. Pot 8"" or under"", 143: ""Clivia, flowering. Pot 8""-10"""", and 144: ""Clivia, foliage"". (There was also a Clivia entered in 2007 under ""Exceptional plants 10–20 years old, to be judged against “perfection” for their species/cultivar."")"
"A popular part of the show floor is the Garden marketplace where visitors can buy plants and seeds, cut flowers, craft items, and other flower, landscaping and horticulture-related items."
"The Show boasts fabulous floral and garden design, live entertainment, culinary events and extraordinary gardening how-to workshops and lectures by experts."
"The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society was founded in 1827. The nation's first flower show was held in Philadelphia in 1829, and showcased many exotic and native plants. The flower show moved to the now-demolished Philadelphia Civic Center in 1966, where it remained each year until 1996, when it moved to its present location at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Today, PHS contributes to the local economy and the green life of Philadelphia and the region. Proceeds from the Flower Show support thousands of revitalization projects in communities. In recent years, a youth division was added to the pressed flower category, with the most recent winner being Kendall Wolson, a 17-year-old student from New Jersey who created a scene depicting two bears catching fish in a river."
= = = Bamboozle (quiz) = = =
"Bamboozle! was a quiz game featured on Channel 4 Teletext in the United Kingdom. It was originally part of Teletext's ""Fun & Games"" category, though the rest of the category had been discontinued for some years before Bamboozle! ended (due to the general discontinuation of all Teletext news and editorial content in December 2009). The last edition, themed around 'Ends and Lasts', appeared on Monday 14 December 2009. The Boozler 'family' appeared one last time on Tuesday 15 December 2009 saying farewell to the Teletext audience."
"On 9 August 2010 Bamboozle! was given a new home by Teletext on the iPhone complete with all the retro graphics. On 11 July 2019, Teletext Holidays launched a version of the Bamboozle quiz on their 404 error page."
"Bamboozle! was originally intended as a real-time game that could be played in conjunction with a broadcast TV programme using a similar multiple choice format as ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"". The decision by the new broadcast teletext franchise holders (Teletext UK) in 1993 to opt for X.25 packet switching meant that it was impossible to adequately synchronise the broadcast of teletext content in the context of a TV programme. The format thus fell back to the form it had operated in largely unchanged since 1994."
"The game used Fastext keys (different coloured buttons on the TV remote control) to select the desired answer from a choice of four, and was ""presented"" by virtual host Bamber Boozler, who derived his name from the word ""bamboozle"" and the name of University Challenge host, Bamber Gascoigne. Bamber Boozler's appearance was constrained by the limitations of the Level 1 World System Teletext alpha mosaic display format. From 1993–2005, Teletext competitions editor Julian Edwards created the quiz ""Bamber Boozler"" and the character ""Bamber Boozler"". In later years, journalists Charlie Ghagan and, latterly, Roger Wilkinson oversaw the quiz. Roger Wilkinson also provides content for the Teletext iPhone app."
"A new set of questions was originally given each week, but this soon became more regular, eventually becoming daily. Each game originally had 25 questions, later reduced to 20, then 15 and eventually 12. The player was required to answer all questions correctly in order to complete the quiz, but was allowed multiple attempts to do so. Initially, if a question was answered incorrectly, the player would have to start again from Question 1, However this was later amended so that a maximum of three questions would need to be answered again. After completing the quiz, there was a score table with themed responses, for example:"
according to how many questions were answered correctly at the first attempt.
"On particular dates the quiz was themed, for example Halloween featured related questions and images of skeletons and spiders, whilst Guy Fawkes Night featured firework based questions, as well as numerous Christmas based versions. There were also special ""name the picture / person"" graphical editions."
"Other Boozler family members were introduced over the game's first few years – Bamber's wife, Bambette, who normally appeared when a question was answered incorrectly; while Saturday's quizzes were generally easier than the weekday editions and were presented by Bamber's son, Buster, with Bambette's role filled by Bonnie, his daughter. At one point in the quiz's history the red, yellow and green keys were sensible answers and the blue was mostly reserved for a comical response although rarely was the correct one. This was later changed and all the keys would have sensible answers."
"The quiz started off at 20 questions, then it went down to 15 and then 12. On very few special occasions it was 30, however one question wrong and contestants had to start from the very beginning."
"The ""Bad Luck"" pages appeared when questions were answered incorrectly, they used to feature little trivial messages at first and then mainly birthday announcements. This was scrapped to introduce ""Bambette's Bonus"" (or Bonnie's Bonus in Junior Bamboozle) where contestants could score again with a question from her. This was not a multiple choice question and contestants could get the answer by pressing the reveal button."
"The makers of ""Bamboozle!"" introduced a weekly competition whereby a viewer could contribute the questions to Bamboozle! As well as having their questions used, names mentioned and their image appear on screen (the viewer could supply a photograph, which was converted to a Teletext-style cartoon); the winning contributors also received a £20 WHSmith gift voucher. Even before this, viewer-submitted questions were readily used in various forms ever since the early days of the quiz."
"Back in the early days of ""Bamboozle!"", on a number of occasions the quiz would be put on hold and in its place was an adventure game (a different one each time), based on the popular children's fantasy programme ""Knightmare"". Viewers had to use the fastext keys to navigate their way through the quest."
"""Ten to One"", was a sports version of ""Bamboozle!"" with the host Brian Boozler. The quiz was so called because it presented ten sports questions and players had to get from the ten down to one. It is a double meaning as Ten to One also relates to bookies popular odds on betting in many sports."
"This quiz ran concurrently with Bamboozle! for sometime until late 1998 where Brian said ""I'm putting down the mic for a bit, I'm back in 1999..."", however it never returned. He was however, during the period that the quiz was ""rested"", a guest quizmaster on Bamboozle! asking the contestants sports questions like before, with Bamber saying at the end ""Thanks Brian... check your score below!""."
"""Junior Bamboozle!"" was a version run on Saturdays for children. It was hosted by Buster Boozler and the bad luck pages were hosted by Bonnie Boozler."
= = = Mike and Ike = = =
"Mike and Ike is a brand of fruit-flavored candies that were first introduced in 1940 by the company Just Born, Inc. The origin of the candy's name remains unknown, but there are many conjectures. Mike and Ikes were originally all fruit flavored but now come in several different varieties which have been introduced over the years."
"The Mike and Ike brand was first introduced in 1940 by Just Born, Inc., which is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Its origin uncertain, the name may have come from the comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), which, however, had ended by the 1940s. Or the name may have referred to the Matina Brothers, two of whom, nicknamed ""Mike"" & ""Ike,"" were billed as circus midgets and had roles as Munchkins in the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz""; the author Dean Jensen wrote without cited evidence that the two became so popular in America that a boxed candy was named after them. . Other proposals include a company-wide contest, a vaudeville song titled “Mike and Ike”, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose nickname was ""Ike."" Just Born acquired the ""Rodda Candy Company"" in 1953 and produced new flavors of the candy, such as cotton candy. Additional flavors such as Root Beer came in the 1960s, and others have been introduced on and off since."
"Mike and Ike are oblong fruit-flavored chewy candies that come in several colors and varieties, including cherry, orange, lime, lemon, and strawberry. Popular varieties are Tropical Typhoon, Berry Blast and Jolly Joes. Each candy has 7 calories, 0 grams of fat, and approximately 1 gram of sugar. The candy is kosher and gluten-free."
"They are similar to Hot Tamales, another candy introduced by the same manufacturer in 1950, though they are not spicy."
"Just Born produces several varieties of Mike and Ikes, including:"
Retro/limited varieties include:
There are also seasonal packages for Easter in which the Mike and Ike flavors are formed as jelly beans.
"Ting (old Norse: þing) means assembly. It first came into being during Viking times and was formed by the freemen of the community, and it generally numbered about a hundred men. Tings were necessary in the clan-based society of Northern Germany and Scandinavia, because they allowed for inter-clan wars to be resolved or prevented through the mediation of the ting. It also served as the place for religious rites and trade negotiations."
Landstinget is also the Danish name for the modern Parliament of Greenland.
"Under the Constitution of 1849, the requirements for the right to vote was the same for the two houses, however the requirements for electability were stricter for Landstinget; candidates were limited to those of age 40 and above and they were required to have a substantial income. The house originally had 51 members, all elected indirectly. The voters elected a group of electors for each constituency, and the electors elected the members of the house. The members were elected for a term of eight years; however, terms were staggered so that half of the seats were up for election every four years."
"With the Constitution of 1866, the electoral system was reformed. The number of seats was increased to 66 of which twelve were appointed by the king for a period of twelve years, and one by the Faroese Løgting. The remaining 53 were elected indirectly."
"In Copenhagen, half the electors were elected by the voters paying the largest amount of tax, and the other half by all the voters. In the rest of the country, one elector was elected by the voters in each parish in the countryside and half as many electors were elected in the market towns by the same system as in Copenhagen. Then for each elector elected in the parishes and the market towns, one elector was found among those that paid the greatest amount of tax in the parishes. As the main direct tax of the time was based on real estate and its value as farmland, this system greatly favored manor owners. The result was a conservative majority lasting 35 years, until the 1902 election."
"The next reform of the electoral system came with the Constitution of 1915, and the first election under this system was the 1918 election. Women were given the right to vote, the number of seats was increased to 72, the number of constituencies was reduced to seven, and the system of royally appointed members was replaced by 18 members elected by the resigning Landsting for a period of eight years."
"Although a 1939 referendum that would have replaced Landstinget with another chamber—the Rigsting—and simplified the legislative process, failed due to a low voter turnout, the bicameral system and thereby Landstinget was abolished when the current constitution was approved in a 1953 referendum."
= = = M. Clifford Townsend = = =
"Maurice Clifford Townsend (August 11, 1884 – November 11, 1954) was the 35th Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from 1937 to 1941. During his term he led relief efforts during and after the Great Flood of 1937."
"Maurice Clifford Townsend, known as Clifford to his friends and family, was born on a farm in Blackford County, Indiana to David and Lydia Glancy Townsend on August 11, 1884. He had one sister, Myrtle, and the two were raised on a country farm. After completing high school in 1901 he worked as a teamster in the oil fields during the Indiana Gas Boom, and later in a factory. In 1907 he entered Marion College in Grant County. After working as a teacher for six years to pay for his education, he graduated in 1907. He then taught in the common schools, and served as school superintendent for different counties between 1909 and 1919."
"He entered politics as a representative in the Indiana House in 1923. His single term in the legislature was focused mostly on reforming the state's tax code, an issue he worked on up through his term as governor. In 1928 he ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress, but was defeated. He then returned to education, serving again as a school superintendent and on the executive committee of the Indiana's Teachers Association in 1929. Townsend's experience in education made Paul V. McNutt consider him as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor and helped him to win the nomination at the state's Democratic convention in 1932."
"He was elected the 33rd Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket and served from 1933 until 1937. The position of Lieutenant Governor was dramatically altered during his term. Previously, the position received only a token salary, only required active work during legislative sessions, which amounted to sixty days every two years. The position was granted significantly more power after the passage of the 1932 Executive Reorganization Act when the position was made head of the state's agricultural department and assigning him other administrative duties. The change put a large number of patronage jobs under his control."
"Townsend's mother placed his name in nomination for governor at the 1936 Democratic state convention. His nomination though, was a tough battle. The Democratic Party was split between three strong faction, with McNutt supporting Townsend, powerful senator Sherman Minton supporting Pleas Greenlee, and the chairman of the state party supporting Kirk McKinney. The fight at the convention was bitter, and a fist fight broke out before the final vote took place. In the end McNutt's control over the party machine determine the nomination in favor of Townsend. The popular McNutt campaigned heavily on Townsend's behalf in the general election. Republicans again made gains in the General Assembly, but Democrat kept the majority and Townsend won the election, defeating Republican Raymond Springer by over 180,000 votes."
"Townsend was inaugurated January 11, 1937. The state was immediately beset with a disaster as the Great Flood of 1937 began. Within a week, every community on the Ohio River was destroyed and hundreds of thousands were homeless. In the early stages, he coordinated evacuation efforts, routing all available trains to carry people to safety as flood waters rose. Thousand of relief workers and the national guard were called out to help rebuild. The disaster remains the second worse to have ever hit the state. Indiana was the only state affected by the flood, and there were no drownings reported. Harry L. Hopkins of the National Relief Administration said, ""No state was better managed during the flood than Indiana."""
"Before the flood relief was completed, a large strike broke out in General Motors factories across the state. Violence broke out in Anderson and the National Guard was called out by Townsend to restore order and protect the factory. The strike prompted Townsend to request the creation of the state Division of Labor to provide voluntary mediation in union strikes. Steel workers in Gary launched a strike in 1937, and the division successfully prevented it from turning violent."
"As the end of his term neared, the former state party chairman Frederick Van Nuys, who had been elected Senator again, attempted take control of the party from the McNutt-Townsend faction. The battle was primarily over who would control federal patronage jobs. President Franklin Roosevelt intervened after Van Nuys opposed his plan to stack the United States Supreme Court, and used his own influence to have Van Nuys defeated in his reelection bid. Townsend at first agreed to go along with Roosevelt's plan, but after McNutt decided it would be to harmful to the state party, Townsend changed his mind, much to Roosevelt's chagrin."
"In the mid-term elections, Republican took the control of the Indiana House of Representatives, 51 to 49. The Republicans blocked Townsend's proposed new social programs, and attempted to roll back many of his predecessor's programs. The Senate blocked the bills from passage, and the session ended in deadlock. Only a few pieces of legislation were passed: the driver's license examination became required by law, pensions for the state's firemen were approved, free textbooks were authorized for public schools and the state ordered school buses to be painted yellow for safety's sake—this last starting a nationwide trend."
"After Townsend left office, he extricated himself from internal politics of the state party, and did not involve himself in the selection of his successor. During World War II Townsend used his farm experience in government service, directing the Office of Agricultural War Relations, the Agricultural Conservation and Adjustment Administration, and the Food Production Administration. In 1943 he resigned from federal service and returned to Indiana to manage his farms in Blackford and Grant counties. Townsend was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in 1946, but was defeated by William E. Jenner. He died November 11, 1954 from a heart attack, and was buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Hartford City, Indiana."

"The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is a zoo in Roeding Park in Fresno, California covering 39 acres and housing over 190 species. Its attractions include Stingray Bay, Dino Dig, Valley Farm, Sea Lion Cove, African Adventure, and Ross Laird's Winged Wonders Bird Show. The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA)."
"The zoo was formed some time around 1908. The earliest zoo record describes a collection consisting of two bears and around fifty birds of various species. According to the zoo's website, ""bears, local cats, hoof stock, and birds were added to the Zoo and housed in log cabin type exhibits."" The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) officially recognized the park opening in 1929 as the Roeding Park Zoo."
"Only few animals were seen, but that number would later rise. The year attendance was around 2,000 and most of the visitors were from Fresno and the surrounding areas."
"The zoo grew substantially in the 1940s and 1950s, with 100 animals and more birds by 1947. The zoo's first foreman, Eldon ""Curly"" Blocker, was hired from the San Diego Zoo. In 1949, the zoo's Asian elephant Nosey (a name determined by a citywide ""Name-the-Elephant"" Contest) was acquired, with help from the Fresno Rotary Club. Her arrival coincided with Fresno's ""49ers Days Rodeo Parade"", and Nosey's presence in that parade was popular enough to spawn the creation of the Fresno Zoological Society, which would create interest in the zoo and provide a fundraising mechanism. In the 1950s, ten large exhibits were added to the zoo grounds with monkeys, sea lions, camels, giraffes, an African bird aviary, a flamingo habitat, and on-site feed and medical compounds. The zoo became an institutional member of the AZA in 1957. In 1965 Paul S. Chaffee was hired as the zoo's first director. In the late 1960s, the animal exhibits were renovated, with climate control being added to increase the comfort of the animals. In 1967, the large bird of prey exhibit was constructed, and in 1968, a master plan for future development was drafted. something to support the rest of this"
"The zoo's area expanded by a third, and new exhibits featuring bison, elk, and prairie dogs were added. In 1976, in honor of the American Bicentennial Celebration, the park's grizzly bear facility was expanded. In 1978, the Park Zoo Trust Fund (distinct from the Zoo Admissions Trust Fund) was established to make sure a portion of concession sales were used to improve the zoo. This freed the zoo from having to approve a budget with the City Council. In 1979, the zoo added the Edward A. Kane Reptile House, the world's first computer-controlled reptile habitat."
"In 1982, Nosey the Elephant's habitat was renovated and three new elephants were brought in. A red wolf exhibit known as Wolf Woods was added in 1984, and the Doris and Karl Falk Wildlife Education Center was completed, becoming part of the zoo's Educational Center. In 1985, the zoo's name changed from the Roeding Park Zoo to the Fresno Zoo. In 1988, the zoo's walk-through rainforest exhibit was added. 1989 saw the addition of a large classroom wing, and the implementation of the Adopt-an-Animal fundraising program. Paul S. Chaffee, the zoo's director since 1965, died in 1990, and the Fresno Zoo was renamed the Chaffee Zoological Gardens of Fresno in his honor. In 1993, Nosey the elephant died at the age of 47."
"In 2004, ""Measure Z"" was passed by the voters (73%) in Fresno to raise money to expand the zoo, and to improve the animal exhibits. The US$150 million project was contingent upon the submission and review of an environmental impact report. The name of the zoo was shortened to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in 2006. In 2007, a traveling ""Stingray Bay"" exhibit visited and attracted large crowds. Several stingrays were bred while they were visiting Fresno. In 2009, a permanent Stingray Bay exhibit was opened, funded by Measure Z. In the rain forest exhibit, the former butterfly house (Maddis House) reopened as the Tropical Treasures exhibit in March 2009, with poison dart frogs and a sloth among other species."
"The first intercollegiate athletic event in the school's history took place on November 25, 1892, when the Agriculturalists defeated the football team from the University of Utah, 12-0. The football program has a rich history (Merlin Olsen and Phil Olsen are alumni) throughout the mid-20th century, but has struggled lately, following two ill-fated stints as an independent program and two more years in the geographically distant Sun Belt Conference, after the Big West Conference, which had housed the Aggies since 1978, elected to stop sponsoring football in 2001. USU's other teams remained in that conference until the school was invited to join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2005. USU had lobbied to join its in-state rivals Utah and BYU in the WAC for many decades prior to 2005, but were only allowed in after the two other schools had left to form the Mountain West Conference. Subsequently both Utah and BYU departed the Mountain West Conference and USU was invited to join that conference, where they currently reside."
"Recently, the men's basketball team, under coach Stew Morrill, has become a nationally respected program, with several conference championships and trips to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The basketball program has been one of the most successful programs in the country since 2000, winning at least 23 games in each season, many conference championships, and appearing in the NCAA tournament numerous times. In fact, many Aggie sports have been extremely successful for many years, though this is often overlooked due to the recent futility of the football team."
"Following the great heights of the 1960s and 70's, Aggie football has fallen upon hard times in recent decades, leading to a disproportionate lack of USU sports coverage in statewide and national media. Many of the Aggie faithful attribute the decline to administrators at both Utah and BYU freezing then-superior USU out of the newly formed WAC. However, other factors cited as leading to the decline include a failure to upgrade facilities until recently, a lack of donors to athletics, and the complacency of past athletics directors. The futility of the football program has had an extremely negative effect on the perception of the university as a whole, and it is something that the Aggies are only now recovering from. 2011 saw the first winning season in many years, a bowl game, and in May 2012, an invitation to the Mountain West Conference, which will give USU its first stable, promising conference home in a half-century."
"However, former athletic director Scott Barnes recently inked deals with TV stations, replaced the head football coach, raised funds, and accomplished numerous necessary reorganizations, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and conference schools. In large part due to his efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses. The Aggies brought in WAC championships in five sports during the 2008–09 academic year, tied for the most in school history."
"As of January 2016, Aggie football has an overall record of 547–533–31 (.506)"
"After many years of futility, the Aggies experienced a renaissance under head coach Gary Andersen, who replaced Brent Guy following the 2008 season. The 2011 campaign was the team's first winning season in many years, resulting in a postseason bowl berth. 2012 has brought the school's first-ever 10-win season and WAC championship (its first outright conference championship since 1936), and national Top 25 rankings in all three major polls. Andersen left USU after the 2012 season and has been replaced by his former offensive coordinator Matt Wells."
"The Aggies have played in eight bowl games in their history, winning three. The team's first victory came in the 1993 Las Vegas Bowl against . The team has made three consecutive bowl appearances, the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, in 2011 and 2012, and the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, in 2013. The team lost to Ohio in the 2011 edition and defeated Toledo 41–15 in the 2012 edition. In 2013 USU defeated Northern Illinois University in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl."
"USU football is played at Maverik Stadium, which seats 25,100."
"The men's cross country team has been impressive in recent years, winning the WAC title for the past five years in a row—each year since joining the WAC. Members of the team have garnered numerous conference and regional awards, and have competed in the NCAA Championships. Likewise, the men's track and field team has long enjoyed success, with a bevy of All-American athletes from decades past. In recent years, the team has also won WAC championships in 2007, 2009, and 2010 (outdoor) and 2008 and 2010 (indoor)."
"Golf has spent many years attempting to return to the heights achieved in the early 1980s by alum Jay Don Blake. As a member of the Aggie golf squad, Blake won the NCAA Championship in 1980 and was named NCAA Player of the Year in 1981. He turned pro that year, and in 1987 joined the PGA Tour, where he has one victory and several top-10 finishes, mostly in the early '90s. He has won three times on the Champions Tour."
"The tennis team has a difficult time attracting major recruits due to the lack of indoor on-campus facilities. The team trains and plays its home matches at an upscale local gym. Despite this deficiency, the team has produced a number of athletes who have won all-conference honors in recent years, drawing from both local and international talent pools."
"Of women's sports at USU, gymnastics has probably been most successful historically, heading to the postseason 26 times, including five trips to the national championships. The soccer team has been successful as of late, finishing the 2008 season with a perfect record in conference play, as well as a WAC title. Despite falling in the conference tournament in 2009, Aggie soccer landed three players on the All-WAC first team."
"Women's volleyball and softball are two of the sports at USU that boast of national championships in their history. In 1978 the Aggie volleyball team defeated UCLA to win the AIAW Large College volleyball national championship. The following year, the team fell to Hawaii in the championship match."
"The Aggie softball team has appeared in four Women's College World Series, in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1984, winning the AIAW Division I softball national championship in 1980 and 1981."
"Neither team has returned to such heights in recent years, though each has been consistently good. The women's tennis team struggles with the same disadvantages as the men's."
"The women's basketball program began rebuilding in 2003 after a 16-year absence. At the time, USU was the only Division I school that did not have a women's basketball program besides the mostly male Virginia Military Institute and The Citadel. It took eight years for Utah State to post a winning record, finishing the 2010–11 season at 16–15 after reaching the second round of the WNIT. The 2011–12 team finished 21–10 for the first 20-win season in school history, exiting the WNIT in the first round. Following the season, Raegan Pebley, who had been head coach since the return of the sport, was hired away by Fresno State, with Jerry Finkbeiner being hired as her replacement."
"The most used sports venue is the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics events are held. TV and radio announcers visiting the Smith Spectrum for the first time commonly state that the spectrum is one of the loudest basketball venues in the country with one of the most enthusiastic crowds in the country, rivaling Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University. It is a tradition that near the beginning of games the crowd chooses one player from the other team who commits a blatant foul, taunts the crowd, etc., and every time that player touches the ball the entire crowd boos loudly until he passes the ball. This pressure on opposing players created by this tradition has cut many outstanding players down to below average while at the Spectrum."
"The football team plays in Maverik Stadium, slightly north and west of the main campus. The stadium had natural grass until 2004, when artificial turf was installed. Romney Stadium is built on a hillside, and appears much smaller from outside than it actually is, as much of the seating and the field are below street level. In 2009, the field at Romney Stadium was named Merlin Olsen Field, in honor of the Hall of Fame alumnus."
"The name Aggies, short for Agriculturalists, is a fixture of many universities that began as land-grant and agricultural colleges. Early USU sports teams were sometimes simply referred to as the ""Farmers"" as well as the Aggies, though the former name was never official. Beginning in the 1930s, an image of a ""bean-pole farmer"" with a pitchfork in hand and hay stalk in mouth began to be used to represent the college, though this too was never made official, and disappeared following the transformation into a full-fledged university in 1957."
"During the late 1960s and early '70s, a movement began on campus to shed the Aggie name in favor of the Utah State Highlanders, but the movement met with widespread opposition and was abandoned. The name ""Highlanders"" was a nod to the university's historic ideological tie to Scotland, which came about very early on in the college's history, mostly due to the university's setting on a hill in a high mountain valley. In fact, for a brief period, USU's teams were indeed nicknamed the ""Scotsmen"" as well, and a remnant of this era lives on in the current and popular fight song ""The Scotsman""."
"A November 7, 1901 meeting decided that the college's official color would be blue. It originated as more of a royal blue, morphing fully into navy by the 1920s. The term ""Big Blue"" came about in the 1960s simply to refer to the uniform color, as opposed to any particular mascot. The image of a bull first appeared on a football game program in 1975, and the following year it was adopted as USU's mascot."
"For a few years, USU used an actual white bull, painted blue, which was brought to sporting events and corralled on the sidelines. However, when the Smith Spectrum was built, there were concerns with the bull ruining the floor. For a short time, the bull was outfitted with red rubber boots, which did not pan out and the bull was retired."
"In 1987 USU Student Athletics Vice President John Mortensen decided that Utah State should still have a mascot and spent $750 on a costume for Big Blue. The costume was somewhat of a disappointment because it was royal blue, not navy, had real animal horns, and was not easy to move around in."
"The costume has since undergone at least one redesign, but is now one of the most active and recognized college mascots in the region. Possibly Big Blue's most well-known antic was his tradition of rappelling from the JumboTron to kick off team introductions for men's basketball games. He also enjoys crowdsurfing. As of 2003, four of the six people who had played the Big Blue role had gone on to become mascots for professional sports teams."
"The HURD is the student section at Utah State University. The HURD started in 2006 and has grown every year since. Beginning as a club in the USU Student Association, the HURD moved to total inclusion of the entire USU student body in the summer of 2012. At capacity, the HURD fills 6,500 seats at Romney Stadium for USU Football and 4,000 seats in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum for USU Basketball. The HURD helps organize major activities, with leadership and help from the HURD Committee, such as tailgates, camp outs, away game watch parties and more for the student body and community. Drawing from its motto ""Be Seen. Be Loud. Be HURD!"", the HURD ensures that the teams who visit Utah State University will experience the best atmosphere in the country for collegiate athletics by being known as one of the craziest student sections in the country."
"The Aggies' principal fight song is known as ""Hail the Utah Aggies"" as well as simply ""Fight Song"". It was composed in 1933 by Mickey Hart, with words by Darwin Jepsen and Mark Hart. The main verse is sung twice, with the chant once in between."
"The popular Scotsman song was composed by student Ebenezer J. Kirkham, class of 1918. At athletic events, ""The Scotsman"" is often sung immediately following ""Hail the Utah Aggies"". The words are sung twice through without a break, accompanied by synchronized arm gestures originally created by a small students in Section K of the Spectrum in the early 90s to represent milking of a cow by hand eventually spread to the entire student section. The motions are yet another example of USU students ingenuity creating longstanding traditions at sporting events. During the final words of the second ""verse"", the students' pitch often rises to a full-out yell."

= = = Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao = = =
"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as the Fight of the Century or the Battle for Greatness, was a professional boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110. Although the fight was considered to be one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a letdown by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast."
"Despite predictions that Mayweather–Pacquiao would be the highest-grossing fight in history as early as 2009, disagreements between the two professional boxers' camps on terms for the fight prevented the bout from coming to fruition until 2015. The failure to arrange the Mayweather–Pacquiao fight was named the 2010 ""Event of the Year"" by ""The Ring"". Serious negotiations were kickstarted in 2014 by an unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter and part-time actor, Gabriel Salvador, made a key introduction between Pacquiao's trainer and confidant Freddie Roach and CBS President Les Moonves, who both worked to facilitate the match. By 2015, negotiations for the fight had been finalized, with all of the major issues that prevented the fight from happening in the past resolved, including purse split, drug testing and location."
"The fight was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) jointly produced by HBO and Showtime, the respective rightsholders of Pacquiao and Mayweather. In the Philippines, the fight was also broadcast in simulcast across three of the country's major broadcast television networks. The fight was expected to be the most lucrative in the history of professional boxing: with an initial estimate of 4.4 million purchases, the PPV alone broke revenue records in the United States (U.S.) with $410 million in revenue, making it the highest-grossing PPV in history, surpassing Mayweather–Álvarez in 2013. By September 2015, the figure had been amended to 4.6 million. The broadcast of the fight in the Philippines was watched by nearly half the country's households. Due to the record high price of the PPV, the fight was also widely broadcast through unauthorized online streams on services such as Periscope."
"Despite the large amount of hype that surrounded it, critics felt that the bout itself was disappointing, primarily citing Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy in the ring and Pacquiao's difficulty in landing punches on Mayweather. This had led to some critics re-labelling the fight 'Better Never Than Late' rather than 'Fight of the Century'. It was later revealed following the event that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the fourth round. Further controversy emerged when it was revealed that prior to the fight, Mayweather had been administered IV fluids cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through a retroactive ""therapeutic use exemption""—an exemption, however, not authorized by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC)."
"When the fight was announced, Mayweather was 38 years old and still undefeated, with a perfect professional record of 47 wins and no losses. On June 6, 2008, six months after defeating Ricky Hatton by a tenth-round technical knockout, Mayweather announced his retirement from boxing. At the time, plans were in motion for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, which was going to take place September 20, 2008. ""This decision was not an easy one for me to make as boxing is all I have done since I was a child,"" Mayweather said. ""However, these past few years have been extremely difficult for me to find the desire and joy to continue in the sport."" At the time, 31-year-old Mayweather registered 39 wins and no losses in his historic career. At the time of his retirement, ""The Ring"" had Mayweather ranked as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Manny Pacquiao at No. 2."
"During Mayweather's brief retirement, Pacquiao earned superstar status in much of the Western world with his eighth-round technical knockout victory over Oscar De La Hoya, for which he moved up from lightweight to welterweight (135 pounds to 147 pounds)."
"On May 2, 2009, the day of Pacquiao's fight against Ricky Hatton, Mayweather announced that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, ""The Ring"" lightweight champion and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Márquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a 12-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a 12-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: ""If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause guess what? I beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round. ... When you talk boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather."""
"Pacquiao would go on to defeat Hatton by a second-round knockout to win ""The Ring"" junior welterweight title. The win made him the second boxer in history to win titles in six weight divisions, the first being Oscar De La Hoya."
"Mayweather vs. Márquez was postponed until September 19, 2009, due to a rib injury suffered by Mayweather. Despite being out of the ring for 21 months, Mayweather looked as sharp as ever and dominated the fight, winning by a lopsided 12-round unanimous decision. After the bout, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe stated that a fight with Pacquiao was the ""next obvious choice from a marketing standpoint."""
"On November 14, 2009, Pacquiao stopped Puerto Rican star Miguel Cotto in round 12 to win the WBO welterweight title. Pacquiao's victory sparked a media frenzy and fans were quick to demand a fight between the two of them, despite the fact that the actual fight itself had not officially been made yet and would not take place until 2015."
"On December 5, 2009, ESPN reported that Pacquiao signed a contract to fight Mayweather on March 13, 2010. Shortly afterward, Pacquiao denied ever signing a contract to fight Mayweather, telling ""FanHouse"", ""There are still some things that need to be negotiated."" On December 11,"
"Golden Boy Promotions sent an eight-page contract to Top Rank, proposing a 50–50 financial split for a fight to take place on March 13, 2010. The contract was very detailed, including such matters as who would weigh-in first (Pacquiao), who would enter the ring first (Pacquiao) and who would be introduced first (Mayweather). The contract included an HBO PPV showing at a cost of $59.95. Billing was to be ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, presented by Top Rank, Golden Boy Promotions, Mayweather Promotions and M-P Promotions in association with [approved sponsors and the site]."" Also included in the contract was Olympic-style drug testing. Venues for the fight being discussed were Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and the Superdome in New Orleans."
"In a video titled ""Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao"" uploaded to YouTube on December 11, 2009, Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, revealed the first hint about Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing, telling roving reporter Elie Seckbach, ""I hear negotiations are a little shady. (Richard) Schaefer and them are unhappy about something. They want Olympic-style drug testing. I said, 'Yeah, no problem.' I said, 'Whatever you want.' Since we accepted that, now they're running scared again."""
"On December 13, 2009, Pacquiao's adviser, Michael Koncz, said Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing was a laughing matter and they had no concerns whatsoever about it. ""Our reaction is, 'So what?' We know Manny doesn't take any illegal drugs or anything. And none of this is getting under Manny's skin or anything. I'm here with Manny, and to him, it's like a joke. It's a laughing matter,"" said Koncz."
"After reports had surfaced that both parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling to comply with the Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent. ""We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight,"" Arum told David Mayo of the ""Grand Rapids Press""."
"Not long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to three tests: one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and immediately after the fight. ""Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested ... It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures ... The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous,"" Arum explained. Freddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the ""Los Angeles Times"" on December 22, 2009, that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before."
"On December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's ""Pacquiao–Hatton: 24/7"" surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao filed suit in U.S. District Court in Nevada on December 30, 2009, against Floyd Mayweather Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr., Roger Mayweather, Mayweather Promotions and Golden Boy Promotions executives Oscar De La Hoya and Richard Schaefer, alleging that they made false and defamatory statements accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs."
"Both sides agreed to enter into mediation on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected."
"Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The ""Grand Rapids Press"", Mayweather said, ""I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is."""
"After the failed negotiations, both boxers moved on to other fights. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated Joshua Clottey via unanimous decision and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision."
"On May 13, 2010, Bob Arum announced that he had penciled in November 13, 2010, as the date of Pacquiao's next fight, possibly against Mayweather. Pacquiao was quoted by the ""Manila Bulletin"" on May 20, as saying, ""As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight."" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking off the rest of 2010 and possibly 2011."
"Arum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. ""That's all been resolved,"" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of ""Yahoo Sports"" regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the ""Las Vegas Review-Journal"", ""There's no longer any issues...The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year."" He would reiterate that comment to the ""Manila Bulletin"", stating, ""It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight."""
