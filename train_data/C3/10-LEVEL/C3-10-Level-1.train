Five plus plus  equals

Well this is a bit of a nonsense.

One hundred plus plus
"Equals, equals."
"Equals, equals."
Now it gets easier.
Mhm.
Now it gets really even harder.
Well which way is it?
Does it get harder or easier?
Three hundred.
Mm.
"Oh, three hundred and four."
"I, I'm not understanding when you're doing plus plus when you're writing down yourself."
What are you trying to prove?
Divide
Mm.
"Well that's, that's, that's very good for divide, but that's a square root sign."
A square root.

"A great big needle about that length, and what I'd do is I'd freeze the back of her tongue"

Oh.
Ooh.
That's sounds
Hey that would be brilliant.

Well apart from the nineteen year he's gone to  university.

"Cambridge, of course!"
"Did he get in on merit or did you just pay a phenomenally am , large amount of cash for him?"
Merit!
Well
Yeah sure!
very hard to believe I think!
But if you go and look down in your statements now just  to check that !
"Go on , it's your turn now."
I want to know how you actually do that.
Oh yes you did!

Go on.

"Oh that's where you should go for your computer, look."
P C World.

This bit's not so bad.
Once you get through that  traffic light back there

Mm.
"Soon as these lights go we should get here, through here quite quickly."
Mm.
Long lights.
I command thee to become orange.
Orange.
Well it's so long for the .
They make them longer during the evenings and Saturday.
Orange!
And this lot have got to go first haven't they?
Mm.
Yeah   .
Quite ridiculous.
Far too long.
"Far too long, yeah."
How do people know it's gonna change?
They just sort of start their engines  still red.

Regulars down here I should imagine.
Where?
Regulars probably who come down here and know
and you wanted to divide them among four people
Yes.
how many would each person get?
"But I don I, I, I didn't quite get the question."
If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people
Yes.
how many would each person get?
Two.
"No, one."
That's better.
Now you did that without a calculator didn't you?
Oh I see.
"Right, now this time do it with the calculator."
So you've got
Four  turn it on.
Turn it on.
You run out of light?
There are.
Now you're on.
Which figure do you want?
No.
No.
You're dividing.
Which one's divide?
That one.
Divide by
Four.
Yes.
That's right.
Equals?
Right.
"Now that wa that time, that's easy."
Now is that ?
Swallows the atmosphere.
I think it's the candlestick.
They don't give off so much light though do they?
No.
Purely decorative.
But I think .
Oh right.
We have paper ones.
Mm mm.
But  might ignite.
"We'll be  no, no, they don't ignite"
because the candle is inside the  shape of the candle  shape holder  that  they're more translucent.
Right.
"I think, but though we've also got some nice glass"
Thank you.
Another grey one there.
"Er, I'm sure we didn't put a brush through my hair in the bath."
"They're lovely, like laser beams."
Oh!
How lovely.
Yeah.
Ah.
Bon appetit.
That's the wine today.

We haven't tried it yet.
Glass Gearoid.
Cheers then chaps!

Are you having to sleep in the
Your mother?
?
people in the house!
Look!
Right.
"I told you I'm still living at home, right?"
Yeah.
"This is , my mother, my father, my sister  my brother, me, my husband, one, two, three children."
Oh really!

"And the dog, yeah."
And
Woof!

"And do you get on very well with all of your family  but, actually living there?"
"Not really, no."
No.
"Can't you afford to find you know, your own house or  rent a place?"
"Would you, if you had the chance"
"Well not really, no."
find your children that had run away?
Probably not.
It's their choice to run away.
How old were they when they did run away?
"Mm  one was seventeen, one was six, and"
Making the choice  !
No.
No.
"My hu , my six year old ran away, but"
Yeah but when
"then came back, and then ran away again"
"So, aren't you concerned him?"
"he tried to go out the door but she reached him back, but she hasn't"
Aren't you concerned about how he's living?
gone to him!
Erm
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
And how he's surviving?
He might even be dead for all you know!
That's sweet!
Don't you care?
Well
"Aren't you a bit, the slightest worried"
Why
You're not concerned?
Why did you have children then if you weren't prepared to
Yeah.
look after them suitably?
Erm  my religion forbid the use of  contraception.
Could we
Ya.
have that off.
Yeah.
I think everybody
No.
Let's not bother.
Alright.
"I'll, I'll quickly run through."
What it is it's the Intercity core brief
Oh!
That's why I
I've seen it.
"We've had it, a copy of it"
Have you got a copy of this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
"Good, good, good, good, good."
Have we?
Yeah.
What's it about?
Does it tell us who's gonna own this
It gives us feedback

Aargh.
It gives us an update on privatization reorganization most of which has appeared
Anything?
in Railnews.
Right.
And it gives us a er tt details of the current Intercity marketing strategy which  is again
Not interested in that either.
Yeah.
"We, we have"
Good.
That's right.
Oh
Why?
just gone the road with  Bev!
she said so
Can we turn it up a bit?
No cos it'll drown the microphone.
Oh!
I feel fine  let me flare my nostrils.
Unless we can turn it off for a bit.
she said so
No.
"No, why not?"
I'm in love with her and I feel fine   afterwards  it's only
I'm so glad that she's my little girl  she's so glad she's telling all the world that her baby buys her things you know
so glad that she's my little girl  she's so glad she's telling all the world   bleagh
"he buys her diamond rings you know, she said so"
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
"`` I suppose it 's just as well she 's gone , though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion , Anne ."
"I do n't see how she got out of the pen , though ."
She must have broken some of the boards off . ''
"`` I did n't think of looking , '' said Anne , `` but I 'll go and see now ."
Martin has never come back yet .
Perhaps some more of his aunts have died .
I think it 's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians .
"The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane , ' I see here that another octogenarian has just died ."
"What is an octogenarian , Peter ? '"
"And Mr. Sloane said he did n't know , but they must be very sickly creatures , for you never heard tell of them but they were dying ."
That 's the way with Martin 's aunts . ''
"`` Martin 's just like all the rest of those French , '' said Marilla in disgust ."
`` You ca n't depend on them for a day . ''
Marilla was looking over Anne 's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard .
"A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen , wringing her hands ."
"`` Anne Shirley , what 's the matter now ? ''"
"`` Oh , Marilla , whatever shall I do ?"
This is terrible .
And it 's all my fault .
"Oh , will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things ?"
"Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day , and now I 've done it ! ''"
"`` Anne , you are the most exasperating girl !"
WHAT is it you 've done ? ''
`` Sold Mr. Harrison 's Jersey cow ... the one he bought from Mr. Bell ... to Mr. Shearer !
Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute . ''
"`` Anne Shirley , are you dreaming ? ''"
`` I only wish I were .
"There 's no dream about it , though it 's very like a nightmare ."
And Mr. Harrison 's cow is in Charlottetown by this time .
"Oh , Marilla , I thought I 'd finished getting into scrapes , and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life ."
What can I do ? ''
`` Do ?
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
O the lovely ! '
"she cried , though Tink 's face was still distorted with passion ."
"` Tink , ' said Peter amiably , ` this lady says she wishes you were her fairy . '"
Tinker Bell answered insolently .
"` What does she say , Peter ? '"
He had to translate .
` She is not very polite .
"She says you are a great ugly girl , and that she is my fairy . '"
He tried to argue with Tink .
"` You know you ca n't be my fairy , Tink , because I am a gentleman and you are a lady . '"
"To this Tink replied in these words , ` You silly ass , ' and disappeared into the bathroom ."
"` She is quite a common fairy , ' Peter explained apologetically ; ` she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles . '"
"They were together in the armchair by this time , and Wendy plied him with more questions ."
` If you do n't live in Kensington Gardens now -- ' ` Sometimes I do still . '
` But where do you live mostly now ? '
` With the lost boys . '
` Who are they ? '
` They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way .
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses .
I 'm captain . '
` What fun it must be ! '
"` Yes , ' said cunning Peter , ` but we are rather lonely ."
You see we have no female companionship . '
` Are none of the others girls ? '
"` Oh no ; girls , you know , are much too clever to fall out of their prams . '"
This flattered Wendy immensely . '
"I think , ' she said , ` it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls ; John there just despises us . '"
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed , blankets and all ; one kick ."
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting , and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house ."
"However , John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there ."
"` And I know you meant to be kind , ' she said , relenting , ` so you may give me a kiss . '"
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses . '
"A creek ran up to meet the path , and close under the bank the ferryman 's hut lay snugly ."
"It was of wattle and clay , and the grass grew green upon the roof ."
Dick went to the door and opened it .
"Within , upon a foul old russet cloak , the ferryman lay stretched and shivering ; a great hulk of a man , but lean and shaken by the country fever ."
"`` Hey , Master Shelton , '' he said , `` be ye for the ferry ?"
"Ill times , ill times !"
Look to yourself .
There is a fellowship abroad .
Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge . ''
"`` Nay ; time 's in the saddle , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Time will ride , Hugh Ferryman ."
I am hot in haste . ''
`` A wilful man ! ''
"returned the ferryman , rising ."
"`` An ye win safe to the Moat House , y ' have done lucky ; but I say no more . ''"
"And then catching sight of Matcham , `` Who be this ? ''"
"he asked , as he paused , blinking , on the threshold of his cabin ."
"`` It is my kinsman , Master Matcham , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Give ye good day , good ferryman , '' said Matcham , who had dismounted , and now came forward , leading the horse ."
"`` Launch me your boat , I prithee ; we are sore in haste . ''"
The gaunt ferryman continued staring .
`` By the mass ! ''
"he cried at length , and laughed with open throat ."
"Matcham coloured to his neck and winced ; and Dick , with an angry countenance , put his hand on the lout 's shoulder ."
"`` How now , churl ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Fall to thy business , and leave mocking thy betters . ''"
"Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat , and shoved it a little forth into the deep water ."
"Then Dick led in the horse , and Matcham followed ."
"`` Ye be mortal small made , master , '' said Hugh , with a wide grin ; `` something o ' the wrong model , belike ."
"Nay , Master Shelton , I am for you , '' he added , getting to his oars ."
`` A cat may look at a king .
"`` Lion-driver , '' she said , at length , `` ye do not admire a maid in a man 's jerkin ? ''"
The moon was now up ; and they were only waiting to repose the wearied horses .
"By the moon 's light , the still penitent but now well-fed Richard beheld her looking somewhat coquettishly down upon him ."
"`` Madam '' -- he stammered , surprised at this new turn in her manners ."
"`` Nay , '' she interrupted , `` it skills not to deny ; Joanna hath told me , but come , Sir Lion-driver , look at me -- am I so homely -- come ! ''"
And she made bright eyes at him .
"`` Ye are something smallish , indeed '' -- began Dick ."
"And here again she interrupted him , this time with a ringing peal of laughter that completed his confusion and surprise ."
`` Smallish ! ''
she cried .
"`` Nay , now , be honest as ye are bold ; I am a dwarf , or little better ; but for all that -- come , tell me !"
"-- for all that , passably fair to look upon ; is ' t not so ? ''"
"`` Nay , madam , exceedingly fair , '' said the distressed knight , pitifully trying to seem easy ."
`` And a man would be right glad to wed me ? ''
she pursued .
"`` O , madam , right glad ! ''"
agreed Dick .
"`` Call me Alicia , '' said she ."
"`` Alicia , '' quoth Sir Richard ."
"`` Well , then , lion-driver , '' she continued , `` sith that ye slew my kinsman , and left me without stay , ye owe me , in honour , every reparation ; do ye not ? ''"
"`` I do , madam , '' said Dick ."
"`` Although , upon my heart , I do hold me but partially guilty of that brave knight 's blood . ''"
`` Would ye evade me ? ''
she cried .
"`` Madam , not so ."
"I have told you ; at your bidding , I will even turn me a monk , '' said Richard ."
"`` Then , in honour , ye belong to me ? ''"
she concluded .
"`` In honour , madam , I suppose '' -- began the young man ."
`` Go to ! ''
she interrupted ; `` ye are too full of catches .
"In honour do ye belong to me , till ye have paid the evil ? ''"
And I go dinnerless ! ''
"In the space of a minute , some running , some walking sharply , according as their stations were nearer or farther away , the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house ; and the caldron , and the fire , which was now burning low , and the dead deer 's carcase on the hawthorn , remained alone to testify they had been there ."
CHAPTER V -- `` BLOODY AS THE HUNTER '' The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind .
"Then they arose , and with many an ache , for they were weary with constraint , clambered through the ruins , and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter ."
"Matcham had picked up the windac and went first , Dick following stiffly , with his cross-bow on his arm ."
"`` And now , '' said Matcham , `` forth to Holywood . ''"
`` To Holywood ! ''
"cried Dick , `` when good fellows stand shot ?"
Not I !
"I would see you hanged first , Jack ! ''"
"`` Ye would leave me , would ye ? ''"
Matcham asked .
"`` Ay , by my sooth ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` An I be not in time to warn these lads , I will go die with them ."
What !
would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among .
I trow not !
Give me my windac . ''
But there was nothing further from Matcham 's mind .
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood ."
Would ye be forsworn ?
Would you desert me -- a perjurer ? ''
"`` Nay , I sware for the best , '' returned Dick ."
`` I meant it too ; but now !
"But look ye , Jack , turn again with me ."
"Let me but warn these men , and , if needs must , stand shot with them ; then shall all be clear , and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath . ''"
"`` Ye but deride me , '' answered Matcham ."
`` These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin . ''
Dick scratched his head .
"`` I can not help it , Jack , '' he said ."
`` Here is no remedy .
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
My unkle has adopted a cat .
it come to his house one day and woudent go away and unkle says it has forgot more than most people ever knowed .
he lets it sleep on his rocking chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his children .
that is not right .
we ought to be kind to cats and give them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our children .
this is oll I can think of so no more at present from edward blake ClaY . ' ''
"`` St. Clair Donnell 's is , as usual , short and to the point ."
St. Clair never wastes words .
I do not think he chose his subject or added the postscript out of malice aforethought .
It is just that he has not a great deal of tact or imagination . '' ''
` Dear Miss Shirley '' ` You told us to describe something strange we have seen .
I will describe the Avonlea Hall .
"It has two doors , an inside one and an outside one ."
It has six windows and a chimney .
It has two ends and two sides .
It is painted blue .
That is what makes it strange .
It is built on the lower Carmody road .
It is the third most important building in Avonlea .
The others are the church and the blacksmith shop .
They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and concerts . ''
"` Yours truly , '' ` Jacob Donnell . ''"
` P.S. .
The hall is a very bright blue . ' ''
"`` Annetta Bell 's letter was quite long , which surprised me , for writing essays is not Annetta 's forte , and hers are generally as brief as St. Clair 's ."
"Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model of good behavior , but there is n't a shadow of orginality in her ."
Here is her letter .
"-- '' ` Dearest teacher , '' `` I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you ."
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind ... with all there is of me to love ... and I want to serve you for ever .
It would be my highest privilege .
That is why I try so hard to be good in school and learn my lessuns . ''
"` You are so beautiful , my teacher ."
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
He wished she had not mentioned letters .
"` Do n't get any letters , ' he said contemptuously ."
` But your mother gets letters ? '
"` Do n't have a mother , ' he said ."
"Not only had he no mother , but he had not the slightest desire to have one ."
He thought them very overrated persons .
"Wendy , however , felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy . '"
"O Peter , no wonder you were crying , ' she said , and got out of bed and ran to him . '"
"I was n't crying about mothers , ' he said rather indignantly . '"
I was crying because I ca n't get my shadow to stick on .
"Besides , I was n't crying . '"
` It has come off ? '
` Yes . '
"Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor , looking so draggled , and she was frightfully sorry for Peter ."
` How awful ! '
"she said , but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap ."
How exactly like a boy !
"Fortunately she knew at once what to do ` It must be sewn on , ' she said , just a little patronisingly ."
` What 's sewn ? '
he asked .
` You 're dreadfully ignorant . '
"` No , I 'm not . '"
But she was exulting in his ignorance . '
"I shall sew it on for you , my little man , ' she said , though he was as tall as herself ; and she got out her housewife , and sewed the shadow on to Peter 's foot . '"
"I daresay it will hurt a little , ' she warned him ."
"` Oh , I sha n't cry , ' said Peter , who was already of opinion that he had never cried in his life ."
"And he clenched his teeth and did not cry ; and soon his shadow was behaving properly , though still a little creased ."
"` Perhaps I should have ironed it , ' Wendy said thoughtfully ; but Peter , boylike , was indifferent to appearances , and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee ."
"Alas , he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy ."
He thought he had attached the shadow himself .
"` How clever I am , ' he crowed rapturously , ` oh , the cleverness of me ! '"
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities .
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"`` I will eat nothing at the hands that slew my kinsman , '' she replied ."
"`` Dear madam , '' Dick cried , `` I swear to you upon the rood I touched him not . ''"
"`` Swear to me that he still lives , '' she returned ."
"`` I will not palter with you , '' answered Dick ."
`` Pity bids me to wound you .
In my heart I do believe him dead . ''
`` And ye ask me to eat ! ''
she cried .
"`` Ay , and they call you ` sir ! '"
Y ' have won your spurs by my good kinsman 's murder .
"And had I not been fool and traitor both , and saved you in your enemy 's house , ye should have died the death , and he -- he that was worth twelve of you -- were living . ''"
"`` I did but my man 's best , even as your kinsman did upon the other party , '' answered Dick ."
`` Were he still living -- as I vow to Heaven I wish it !
"-- he would praise , not blame me . ''"
"`` Sir Daniel hath told me , '' she replied ."
`` He marked you at the barricade .
"Upon you , he saith , their party foundered ; it was you that won the battle ."
"Well , then , it was you that killed my good Lord Risingham , as sure as though ye had strangled him ."
And ye would have me eat with you -- and your hands not washed from killing ?
But Sir Daniel hath sworn your downfall .
He 't is that will avenge me ! ''
The unfortunate Dick was plunged in gloom .
"Old Arblaster returned upon his mind , and he groaned aloud ."
`` Do ye hold me so guilty ? ''
he said ; `` you that defended me -- you that are Joanna 's friend ? ''
`` What made ye in the battle ? ''
she retorted .
"`` Y ' are of no party ; y ' are but a lad -- but legs and body , without government of wit or counsel !"
Wherefore did ye fight ?
"For the love of hurt , pardy ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` I know not ."
"But as the realm of England goes , if that a poor gentleman fight not upon the one side , perforce he must fight upon the other ."
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
Oh !
how high she could kick !
` The old chair-cover in the corner split when he saw her .
` The urn would have sung but she said she had a cold ; she could not sing unless she boiled .
` In the window was an old quill pen .
There was nothing remarkable about her except that she had been dipped too deeply into the ink .
But she was very proud of that . '
"`` If the urn will not sing , '' said she , `` outside the door hangs a nightingale in a cage who will sing . '' '"
"`` I do n't think it 's proper , '' said the kettle , `` that such a foreign bird should be heard . '' '"
"`` Oh , let us have some acting , '' said everyone ."
`` Do let us ! ''
` Suddenly the door opened and the maid came in .
Everyone was quite quiet .
There was not a sound .
"But each pot knew what he might have done , and how grand he was ."
` The maid took the matches and lit the fire with them .
"How they spluttered and flamed , to be sure !"
"`` Now everyone can see , '' they thought , `` that we are the grandest !"
How we sparkle !
What a light - '' ` But here they were burnt out . '
` That was a delightful story ! '
said the sultana . '
I quite feel myself in the kitchen with the matches .
"Yes , now you shall marry our daughter . '"
"` Yes , indeed , ' said the sultan , ` you shall marry our daughter on Monday . '"
And they treated the young man as one of the family .
"The wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated ."
"Biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers ."
It was all splendid .
"` Now I must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son ."
"And so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air ."
"Whirr-r-r , how they fizzed and blazed !"
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
I suppose you 'll soon be leaving Sampson 's .
He told me he did n't need you after the holiday season was over .
What are you going at next ?
Have you anything in view ? ''
Bertie shook his head sorrowfully .
"`` No , sir ; but , '' he added more cheerfully , `` I guess I 'll find something if I hunt around lively ."
I almost always do . ''
"He forgot his shyness ; his face flushed hopefully , and he looked straight at the doctor with his bright , earnest eyes ."
The doctor poked the fire energetically and looked very wise .
But just then the girls came up and carried Bertie off to display their holiday gifts .
And there was a fur cap and a pair of mittens for him !
He wondered whether he was dreaming .
"`` And here 's a picture-book for William John , '' said Amy , `` and there is a sled out in the kitchen for him ."
"Oh , there 's the dinner-bell ."
I 'm awfully hungry .
"Papa says that is my ` normal condition , ' but I do n't know what that means . ''"
"As for that dinner -- Bertie might sometimes have seen such a repast in delightful dreams , but certainly never out of them ."
It was a feast to be dated from .
"When the plum pudding came on , the doctor , who had been notably silent , leaned back in his chair , placed his finger-tips together , and looked critically at Bertie ."
`` So Mr. Sampson ca n't keep you ? ''
Bertie 's face sobered at once .
He had almost forgotten his responsibilities .
"`` No , sir ."
He says I 'm too small for the heavy work . ''
"`` Well , you are rather small -- but no doubt you will grow ."
Boys have a queer habit of doing that .
I think you know how to make yourself useful .
I need a boy here to run errands and look after my horse .
"If you like , I 'll try you ."
"You can live here , and go to school ."
"I sometimes hear of places for boys in my rounds , and the first good one that will suit you , I 'll bespeak for you ."
How will that do ? ''
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"`` Let us go around to the Point , '' she said ."
`` Have you matches ?
No ?
"Emily , get some ."
We must light a bonfire at least .
And bring Father 's glass . ''
"`` It is not a fit night for you to be out , '' said Alan anxiously ."
`` You are sheltered here -- you do n't feel it -- but it 's a fearful storm down there . ''
`` I am not afraid of the storm .
It will not hurt me .
Let us hurry .
It is growing dark already . ''
In silence they breasted their way to the shore and around the headland .
"Arriving opposite Philip 's Point , a lull in the sleet permitted them to see the sunken schooner and the clinging figure ."
Lynde waved her hand to him and they saw him wave back .
"`` It wo n't be necessary to light a fire now that he has seen us , '' said Lynde ."
`` Nothing can be done with village help till morning and that man can never cling there so long .
"He will freeze to death , for it is growing colder every minute ."
His only chance is to swim ashore if he can swim .
The danger will be when he comes near shore ; the undertow of the backwater on the quicksand will sweep him away and in his probably exhausted condition he may not be able to make head against it . ''
"`` He knows that , doubtless , and that is why he has n't attempted to swim ashore before this , '' said Alan ."
`` But I 'll meet him in the backwater and drag him in . ''
"`` You -- you 'll risk your own life , '' cried Lynde ."
"`` There is a little risk certainly , but I do n't think there is a great one ."
"Anyhow , the attempt must be made , '' said Alan quietly ."
Suddenly Lynde 's composure forsook her .
She wrung her hands .
"`` I ca n't let you do it , '' she cried wildly ."
`` You might be drowned -- there 's every risk .
You do n't know the force of that backwater .
"Alan , Alan , do n't think of it . ''"
She caught his arm in her white wet hands and looked into his face with passionate pleading .
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
"And I love you , Eve . ''"
Mollie lowered her eyes and the long fringe of her lashes lay in a burnished semi-circle on her cheek .
"`` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that it must have been very delightful in Eden ."
"But we are not really there , you know -- we are only playing that we are ."
And it is time for me to go back .
I must get the breakfast -- that sounds too prosaic for paradise . ''
Murray bent still closer .
"`` Before we remember that we are only playing at paradise , will you kiss me , dear Eve ? ''"
"`` You are very audacious , '' said Mollie coldly ."
"`` We are in Eden yet , '' he urged ."
`` That makes all the difference . ''
"`` Well , '' said Mollie ."
And Murray kissed her .
They had passed back over the fern path and were in the pasture before either spoke again .
"Then Murray said , `` We have left Eden behind -- but we can always return there when we will ."
"And although we were only playing at paradise , I was not playing at love ."
"I meant all I said , Mollie . ''"
`` Have you meant it often ? ''
asked Mollie significantly .
"`` I never meant it -- or even played at it -- before , '' he answered ."
`` I did -- at one time -- contemplate the possibility of playing at it .
But that was long ago -- as long ago as last night .
"I am glad to the core of my soul that I decided against it before I met you , dear Eve ."
I have the letter of decision in my coat pocket this moment .
I mean to mail it this afternoon . '' ''
"` Curiosity knows no gender , ' '' quoted Mollie ."
"`` Then , to satisfy your curiosity , I must bore you with some personal history ."
"My parents died when I was a little chap , and my uncle brought me up ."
"He has been immensely good to me , but he is a bit of a tyrant ."
Recently he picked out a wife for me -- the daughter of an old sweetheart of his .
I have never even seen her .
But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there .
"As soon as the ceremony was over , Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel ."
He was going to China .
Father and I came back home .
Nobody knew -- not even Emily .
He said we must not tell Mother until she was better .
But she was never better .
She only lived three months more -- she lived them happily and at rest .
"When I think of that , I am not sorry for what I did ."
Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me .
"I waited , sick at heart ."
But he did not come -- he has never come .
We have never heard a word of or about him since .
Sometimes I feel sure he can not be still living .
"But never a day dawns that I do n't say to myself , ` Perhaps he will come today ' -- and , oh -- '' She broke down again , sobbing bitterly ."
"Amid all the daze of his own pain Alan realized that , at any cost , he must not make it harder for her by showing his suffering ."
"He tried to speak calmly , wisely , as a disinterested friend ."
`` Could it not be discovered whether your -- this man -- is or is not living ?
Surely your father could find out . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , he says he has no way of doing so ."
"We do not know if Captain Harmon had any relatives or even where his home was , and it was his own ship in which he sailed ."
"Father would be glad to think that Frank Harmon was dead , but he does not think he is ."
"He says he was always a fickle-minded fellow , one fancy driving another out of his mind ."
"Oh , I can bear my own misery -- but to think what I have brought on you !"
I never dreamed that you could care for me .
I was so lonely and your friendship was so pleasant -- can you ever forgive me ? ''
"`` There is nothing to forgive , as far as you are concerned , Lynde , '' said Alan steadily ."
`` You have done me no wrong .
I have loved you sincerely and such love can be nothing but a blessing to me .
I only wish that I could help you .
It wrings my heart to think of your position .
But I can do nothing -- nothing .
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
Sore bested ? ''
returned the knight .
"`` Nay , then , we will make speed sitting down , good Richard ."
"As the world goes in this poor realm of England , he that rides softliest rides surest ."
"Delay , they say , begetteth peril ; but it is rather this itch of doing that undoes men ; mark it , Dick ."
"But let me see , first , what cattle ye have brought ."
"Selden , a link here at the door ! ''"
"And Sir Daniel strode forth into the village street , and , by the red glow of a torch , inspected his new troops ."
He was an unpopular neighbour and an unpopular master ; but as a leader in war he was well-beloved by those who rode behind his pennant .
"His dash , his proved courage , his forethought for the soldiers ' comfort , even his rough gibes , were all to the taste of the bold blades in jack and salet ."
"`` Nay , by the rood ! ''"
"he cried , `` what poor dogs are these ?"
"Here be some as crooked as a bow , and some as lean as a spear ."
"Friends , ye shall ride in the front of the battle ; I can spare you , friends ."
Mark me this old villain on the piebald !
A two-year mutton riding on a hog would look more soldierly !
Ha !
"Clipsby , are ye there , old rat ?"
"Y ' are a man I could lose with a good heart ; ye shall go in front of all , with a bull 's eye painted on your jack , to be the better butt for archery ; sirrah , ye shall show me the way . ''"
"`` I will show you any way , Sir Daniel , but the way to change sides , '' returned Clipsby , sturdily ."
Sir Daniel laughed a guffaw .
"`` Why , well said ! ''"
he cried .
"`` Hast a shrewd tongue in thy mouth , go to !"
I will forgive you for that merry word .
"Selden , see them fed , both man and brute . ''"
The knight re-entered the inn .
"`` Now , friend Dick , '' he said , `` fall to ."
Here is good ale and bacon .
"Eat , while that I read . ''"
"Sir Daniel opened the packet , and as he read his brow darkened ."
"When he had done he sat a little , musing ."
Hook wetted his dry lips .
"` Ay , ' he said , ` that 's the fear that haunts me . '"
Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm .
"` Smee , ' he said , ` this seat is hot . '"
He jumped up .
"` Odds bobs , hammer and tongs I 'm burning . '"
"They examined the mushroom , which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland ; they tried to pull it up , and it came away at once in their hands , for it had no root ."
"Stranger still , smoke began at once to ascend ."
The pirates looked at each other . '
A chimney ! '
they both exclaimed .
They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground .
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood .
Not only smoke came out of it .
"There came also children 's voices , for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering ."
"The pirates listened grimly , and then replaced the mushroom ."
They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees .
` Did you hear them say Peter Pan 's from home ? '
"Smee whispered , fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew ."
Hook nodded .
"He stood for a long time lost in thought , and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face ."
Smee had been waiting for it .
"` Unrip your plan , captain , ' he cried eagerly ."
"` To return to the ship , ' Hook replied slowly through his teeth , ` and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it ."
"There can be but one room below , for there is but one chimney ."
The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece .
That shows they have no mother .
We will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids ' lagoon .
"These boys are always swimming about there , playing with the mermaids ."
"They will find the cake and they will gobble it up , because , having no mother , they do n't know how dangerous 't is to eat rich damp cake . '"
"He burst into laughter , not hollow laughter now , but honest laughter ."
"` Aha , they will die . '"
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
"A whistle sounded thrice , and then again twice ."
It was repeated from another quarter .
"The woods on either side became full of the sound of people bursting through the underwood ; and a bewildered deer ran out into the open , stood for a second on three feet , with nose in air , and then plunged again into the thicket ."
"Selden still ran , bounding ; ever and again an arrow followed him , but still would miss ."
It began to appear as if he might escape .
"Dick had his bow armed , ready to support him ; even Matcham , forgetful of his interest , took sides at heart for the poor fugitive ; and both lads glowed and trembled in the ardour of their hearts ."
"He was within fifty yards of them , when an arrow struck him and he fell ."
"He was up again , indeed , upon the instant ; but now he ran staggering , and , like a blind man , turned aside from his direction ."
Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him .
`` Here ! ''
he cried .
`` This way !
here is help !
"Nay , run , fellow -- run ! ''"
"But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the shoulder , between the plates of his brigandine , and , piercing through his jack , brought him , like a stone , to earth ."
"`` O , the poor heart ! ''"
"cried Matcham , with clasped hands ."
"And Dick stood petrified upon the hill , a mark for archery ."
"Ten to one he had speedily been shot -- for the foresters were furious with themselves , and taken unawares by Dick 's appearance in the rear of their position -- but instantly , out of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads , a stentorian voice arose , the voice of Ellis Duckworth ."
`` Hold ! ''
it roared .
`` Shoot not !
Take him alive !
It is young Shelton -- Harry 's son . ''
"And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several times , and was again taken up and repeated farther off ."
"The whistle , it appeared , was John Amend-All 's battle trumpet , by which he published his directions ."
"`` Ah , foul fortune ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` We are undone .
"Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! ''"
And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine clump that covered the summit of the hill .
"CHAPTER VI -- TO THE DAY 'S END It was , indeed , high time for them to run ."
"It was red and hot , and now and again it was a little darkened -- as it were , the embers of a bonfire smouldering ."
For the life of me I could not think what it might be .
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing .
"The western end was already steeped in moonshine ; the rest , and the block house itself , still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light ."
"On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon ."
There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze .
"I stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also ."
"It had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain 's orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent ."
"I stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade ."
"To make assurance surer , I got upon my hands and knees and crawled , without a sound , towards the corner of the house ."
"As I drew nearer , my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened ."
"It is not a pleasant noise in itself , and I have often complained of it at other times , but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep ."
"The sea-cry of the watch , that beautiful `` All 's well , '' never fell more reassuringly on my ear ."
"In the meantime , there was no doubt of one thing ; they kept an infamous bad watch ."
"If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them , not a soul would have seen daybreak ."
"That was what it was , thought I , to have the captain wounded ; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard ."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND
"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
The Fairy Flower
And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.
"It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her."
"""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"""
And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.
"""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said."
But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
"For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it."
"And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass."
"He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone."
"He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits."
At Last! At Last!
"Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself:"
"""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!"""
"But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real."
The Book of DRAGONS
I. The Book of Beasts
"He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket."
"And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, ""Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."""
"Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, ""Oh, don't, Nurse,"" and, ""I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"" or, ""Never mind my hair, it's all right,"" and, ""That'll do."""
"""You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"""
said Nurse.
"The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts."
"They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: ""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."""
"""Yes, please, sir,"" said Lionel, ""when does it begin?"""
"""You will be crowned this afternoon,"" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other."
"""Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea."
"""Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."""
"The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No."
"7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up."
"As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all."
This made her very tired.
"The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry."
"One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying."
"Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other."
"""I heard nothing,"" said he."
"""Neither did I,"" said she."
"But the noise grew louder and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks."
"But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where."
"""It can't be anything in the dungeon,"" said the blacksmith, wiping his face. ""Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."""
"""There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?"" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it."
"Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals."
"""I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"""
"said he, ""but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."""
"""I quite understand,"" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust."
"So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon."
"""It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows where,"" said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding stairs."
"But the dragon was too quick for him it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes."
"""No you don't,"" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib."
"""Deary, deary me,"" said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw of the dragon. ""Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"""
The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.
"""Do you mind saying that again?"" said he, quite politely."
"So John said again, very distinctly:"
"""Here is a nice end for a respectable blacksmith."""
"""I didn't know,"" said the dragon. ""Fancy now! You're the very man I wanted."""
"""So I understood you to say before,"" said John, his teeth chattering."
"""Oh, I don't mean what you mean,"" said the dragon, ""but I should like you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?"""
"""I might, sir,"" said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon."
"""A master craftsman you are a master, of course? can see in a minute what's wrong,"" the dragon went on. ""Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"""
"John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting."
"The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry."
"All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease."
"At the wedding they drank and feasted both well and long; for feast they all could, even if they could not find the Princesses, and if they have not yet done feasting and drinking they must be at it still."
THE CAT ON THE DOVREFELL
"Once on a time there was a man up in Finnmark who had caught a great white bear, which he was going to take to the King of Denmark. Now, it so fell out, that he came to the Dovrefell just about Christmas Eve, and there he turned into a cottage where a man lived, whose name was Halvor, and asked the man if he could get house-room there for his bear and himself."
"""Heaven never help me, if what I say isn't true!"" said the man; ""but we can't give anyone house-room just now, for every Christmas Eve such a pack of Trolls come down upon us, that we are forced to flit, and haven't so much as a house over our own heads, to say nothing of lending one to anyone else."""
"""Oh?"" said the man, ""if that's all, you can very well lend me your house; my bear can lie under the stove yonder, and I can sleep in the side-room."""
"Well, he begged so hard, that at last he got leave to stay there; so the people of the house flitted out, and before they went, everything was got ready for the Trolls; the tables were laid, and there was rice porridge, and fish boiled in lye, and sausages, and all else that was good, just as for any other grand feast."
"So, when everything was ready, down came the Trolls. Some were great, and some were small; some had long tails, and some had no tails at all; some, too, had long, long noses; and they ate and drank, and tasted everything. Just then one of the little Trolls caught sight of the white bear, who lay under the stove; so he took a piece of sausage and stuck it on a fork, and went and poked it up against the bear's nose, screaming out:"
"""Pussy, will you have some sausage?"""
"Then the white bear rose up and growled, and hunted the whole pack of them out of doors, both great and small."
"Next year Halvor was out in the wood, on the afternoon of Christmas Eve, cutting wood before the holidays, for he thought the Trolls would come again; and just as he was hard at work, he heard a voice in the wood calling out:"
"""Halvor! Halvor!"""
"""Well,"" said Halvor, ""here I am."""
"""Have you got your big cat with you still?"""
"""Yes, that I have,"" said Halvor; ""she's lying at home under the stove, and what's more, she has now got seven kittens, far bigger and fiercer than she is herself."""
"""Oh, then, we'll never come to see you again,"" bawled out the Troll away in the wood, and he kept his word; for since that time the Trolls have never eaten their Christmas brose with Halvor on the Dovrefell."
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS PRETTIEST
"A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe."
"""Dear friend,"" said the Snipe, ""don't shoot my children!"""
"""How shall I know your children?"" asked the Sportsman. ""What are they like?"""
"""Oh!"" said the Snipe, ""mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."""
"""Very well,"" said the Sportsman, ""I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."""
"But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot."
"""Oh, oh!"" said the Snipe, ""why did you shoot my children after all?"""
"""What! these your children!"" said the Sportsman; ""why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"""
"""Woe is me!"" said the Snipe; ""don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"""
AMONG THE FOREST PEOPLE
MR. RED SQUIRREL COMES TO LIVE IN THE FOREST
"Life in the forest is very different from life in the meadow, and the forest people have many ways of doing which are not known in the world outside. They are a quiet people and do not often talk or sing when there are strangers near. You could never get acquainted with them until you had learned to be quiet also, and to walk through the underbrush without snapping twigs at every step. Then, if you were to live among them and speak their language, you would find that there are many things about which it is not polite to talk. And there is a reason for all this."
"In the meadow, although they have their quarrels and their own troubles, they always make it up again and are friendly, but in the forest there are some people who can never get along well together, and who do not go to the same parties or call upon each other. It is not because they are cross, or selfish, or bad. It is just because of the way in which they have to live and hunt, and they cannot help it any more than you could help having eyes of a certain color."
"These are things which are all understood in the forest, and the people there are careful what they say and do, so they get on very well indeed, and have many happy times in that quiet, dusky place.

"[1474] Psellus (_Quaenam sunt Graecorum opiniones de daemonibus_, 3,"

I cannot agree with Miss J. Harrison (_Prolegomena to the Study of
"Greek Religion_, p. 569) as to the importance of Psellus’ testimony"
in any respect. He appears to me to give no more than a _résumé_ of

even more confused.

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"
relations between the two thinkers can be gathered only through an
adequate knowledge of both Croce's and Gentile's work.

By Paul Ernst

_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.
Not since the absorbing adventures of D'Artagnan have we had
anything so good in the blended vein of romance and comedy.

GENERAL FOREWORD
"No word of Preface is necessary to this Volume, except to say that"
"in presenting it to his readers, the author feels that that he is"
fulfilling a promise made to them when Volume I of the series was
issued.
A word of explanation will be found as an introduction to each
"subdivision of the book, which excludes the necessity of making any"
reference to such subdivisions in this General Forward.
THE AUTHOR.
"Salt Lake City, January, 1912."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
GENERAL FOREWORD
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
One of Captain Roberts's pirates. Hanged at the age of 25.
"SMITH, JOHN."
One of the mutinous crew of the _Antonio_. Hanged at Boston in 1672.
"SMITH, JOHN WILLIAMS."
"Of Charleston, Carolina."
"Hanged in 1718 for piracy, at Charleston."
"SMITH, MAJOR SAMUEL. Buccaneer."
At one time a buccaneer with the famous Mansfield.
"In 1641 he was sent, by the Governor of Jamaica, with a party to reinforce"
the troops which under Mansfield had recaptured the New Providence Island
from the Spanish. In 1660 he was taken prisoner by the Spanish and carried
to Panama and there kept in chains in a dungeon for seventeen months.
"DE SOTO, BERNADO."
One of the crew of the schooner _Panda_ that took and plundered the Salem
brig _Mexican_. The crew of the _Panda_ were captured by an English
"man-of-war and taken to Boston. De Soto was condemned to death, but"
eventually fully pardoned owing to his heroic conduct in rescuing the crew
A sleepy old forgotten song.
"Softly the stealthy night descends,"
The black sails fade into the sky:
"Is this not, where the sea-line ends,"
The shore-line of infinity?
I cannot think or dream: the grey
"Unending waste of sea and night,"
"Dull, impotently infinite,"
Blots out the very hope of day.
RAIN ON THE DOWN.
"NIGHT, and the down by the sea,"
And the veil of rain on the down;
And she came through the mist and the rain to me
From the safe warm lights of the town.
"The rain shone in her hair,"
And her face gleamed in the rain;
And only the night and the rain were there
As she came to me out of the rain.
BEFORE THE SQUALL.
"""I wish this confounded thing hadn't happened. It spoils our win."""
"The Chief Justice nodded, and whistled a bar or two of some sad ditty."
"""I'm glad she's dead, poor soul, Perry,"" he said."
"""There's the girl,"" said Sir Robert."
"""Ay, there's the girl."""
"They did not speak again till they were just parting, when the Chief"
"Justice broke out,"
"""Why the deuce couldn't the fellow take his beastly photograph with"
"him?"""
"""It's very absurd,"" answered Sir Robert, ""but I feel just the same about"
"it."""
"""I'm hanged if you're not a gentleman, Perry,"" said the Chief Justice,"
"and he hastened away, blowing his nose."

"MY DEAR WHITE,"
The publication of this book is a business arrangement between you and
me. Its dedication however has nothing to do with the relations of
"author and publisher in those capacities, but is merely an expression"
of friendship and esteem. This then is to remind you of pleasant hours

Noll went close to him hurriedly:
"“One word, Netherby--quick, before she comes--do you know where Betty"

Netherby smiled a sad smile:
"“Ah, Noll, that _you_ should have to ask _me_ that!”"
Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.
"As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went into the"

turned at his footfall.
Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the harsh light
had gone out of her eyes:
“Won’t you be a little lonely here to-night?” Noll asked her.
"“No,” she said--“she has taken seats for all three of us.”"

A great silence held for a moment. The woman's head sank upon the
man's shoulder. Madness had passed. Her eyes were fixed upon his with
"a wonderful earnestness, a splendid calm."
"""Is this a dream?"""
"""It is the truth!"""
Through the forest aisles rode the Duke of Spoleto.
He saw and paused.
"""I return beyond the Alps to join the forces of Rudolf of Hapsburg. My"

He wheeled about and was gone.
Again silence held for a pace.
Presently Ilaria gave a great sigh and looked strangely at the sun.

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
Lift not your Hands to him for Help. For he
As impotently works as you or I.

Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.

And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.

Behind the new glitter of her eyes there was stark misery.

The appeal was a labored whisper.

"Crane waited. He waited for what seemed like ages, but a glance at his"
watch told him it had been less than five minutes. He disconnected and
dialed again.
"""This is Crane. We got cut off. I want to talk to Porter."""
"""I'm sorry but Mr. Porter has gone for the day."""
"""Well, where can I reach him? It's important."""
"""I'm sorry. Mr. Porter left no number."""

"""He didn't say."""
"Crane slammed the phone down. ""The bastards!"" he snarled. ""The lousy,"
crummy bastards. Running like a pack of scared rats. Bureaucrats!
"Damned, cowardly, self-appointed opportunists!"""
He stopped cursing and sat for a while.
When he got up and left the office he looked and felt old but he had
faced a truth. It would not be necessary to campaign next year.
It wouldn't be of any use.
"'None that can help you,' he replied; 'some that you can help.'"
"She started and looked at him wildly, her lips apart, her eyes wide"
"with hope, fear, expectation. What did he mean? What could he mean by"
this new turn? Ha!
"She had her face towards the window, and dark as the room was"
growing--outside the light was failing fast--he read the thought in
"her eyes, and nodded."
"'The Waldgrave?' he said lightly. 'Yes, he is alive, Countess, at"
present; and your steward also.'
"'They are prisoners?' she whispered, her cheeks grown white."
'Prisoners; and under sentence of death.'
'Where?'
'In my camp.'
'Why?' she muttered. But alas! she knew; she knew already.
"'They are hostages for your good behaviour,' he answered in his cold,"
"mocking tone. 'If their principal satisfies me, good; they will go"
"free. If not, they die--to-morrow.'"
'To-morrow?' she gasped.
"'To-morrow,' he answered ruthlessly. 'Now I think we understand one"
another.'
"When you were here, I sometimes tired,"
"Ah me! that you so loved me, dear."
"Now, in these weary days desired,"
You are no longer here.
"When you were here, did either know"
"That each so loved the other, dear?"
But that was long and long ago:
You are no longer here.
APRIL MIDNIGHT.
"SIDE by side through the streets at midnight,"
"Roaming together,"
"Through the tumultuous night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
"Roaming together under the gaslight,"
"Day’s work over,"
"How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,"
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
"Cool the wind blows, fresh in our faces,"
"Cleansing, entrancing,"
"After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,"
Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
"Good it is to be here together,"
"""I've found a certain part of those brains developed in a peculiar"
"way--"""
"Taber smiled. ""You're sure of that?"""
"""Well ... that's my theory. It would appear logical that--"""
"Taber leaned forward suddenly and extended his glass, the grin on his"
"face showing some genuine humor. ""Let's have another drink, Doctor. Then"
"I'll go. I love the factual way this Scotch of yours hits my stomach."""

"Frank Corson entered the office of Wilson Maynard, Superintendent of"
Park Hill Hospital. Maynard looked out over the tops of his
"old-fashioned pince-nez glasses and said, ""Oh, Doctor Corson. You phoned"
"for a chat."""
It was the rather pompous superintendent's way of saying he was happy to
give Frank Corson a little time. He considered all the doctors and
"nurses at Park Hill his ""boys and girls,"" and he did the ""father"" bit"
very well.
"""Yes, I--"""
"Maynard peered even harder. ""You don't look well, Frank. Pale. You've"
"been working too hard."""
"""Show-down."""
"""Cut!"" once more peremptorily from Rance; and then, when she had cut,"
"one question more: ""Best two out of three?"""
"""Best two out of three."" Swift, staccato sentences, like the rapid"
"crossing of swords, the first preliminary interchange of strokes before"
the true duel begins.
"Rance dealt the cards. Before either looked at them, he glanced across"
"at the Girl and asked scornfully, perhaps enviously:"
"""What do you see in him?"""
"""What do you see in me?"" she flashed back instantly, as she picked up"
"her cards; and then: ""What have you got?"""
"""King high,"" declared the gambler."
"""King high here,"" echoed the Girl."
"""Jack next,"" and he showed his hand."
"""Queen next,"" and the Girl showed hers."
"""You've got it,"" conceded the gambler, easily. Then, in another tone,"
"""but you're making a mistake--"""
"""If I am, it's my mistake! Cut!"""
"Rance cut the cards. The Girl dealt them steadily. Then,"

"There was the upflashing of a sword, and a hoarse challenge frightened"
the night.
Giovanni Frangipani saw a furious face glaring dead white from under
the shadow of a shield.
"He stopped in his onward rush, blinked at the duke as one gone mad."

ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.
THE moonlight had tangled the trees
manner that he was different from the others.
“You are Jack Bosworth?” he asked.
"“That’s my name,” replied the boy."
“You are here on a mission for your father?”
“I am here on a hunting trip.”
"“With business on the side, eh?”"
"“No business at all,” replied Jack."
“We know better than that!” the stranger answered.
“What do you want of us?” asked Jack.
"“We want information now in your possession,” answered the fellow,"
looking Jack sharply in the eyes.
“What kind of information?”
“We want to know where certain documents are.”
"“You’ll have to ask some one else, then.”"
“We are certain that you have the information we require.”
"“If I had,” Jack answered, “you never would get it from me.”"
"“You will gain nothing by being obstinate,” the fellow said. “Remember"
"""Good Lord!"" moaned the Superintendent, ""and what's your salary?"""
The sergeant's good-humour was impregnable.
"""Give me time,"" he said, and the sentence was almost drowned in a loud"
knock at the door. An instant later Kilshaw rushed in.
"""What's this, Dawson?"" he cried to the Superintendent; ""what's this"
"about the murder?"""
"""You haven't heard, sir?"""
"""I went out of town to avoid this infernal row to-day, and am only just"
"back."""
Dawson smiled discreetly. He could understand that the proceedings of
the day would not attract Mr. Kilshaw.
"""But is it true,"" Kilshaw went on eagerly, ""that Mr. Benham has been"
"murdered?"""
"""Well, it looks like it, sir,"" and Dawson gave a full account of the"
circumstances.
"""And the motive?"" asked Kilshaw."
"""Robbery, I suppose. His pockets were empty, and according to our"
"information he was generally flush of money; where he got it, I don't"
"know."""

NOCTURNES.
NOCTURNE.
The spectral custodian had refilled the tankards with amber liquid.
Thereof the Abbot sipped understandingly.
"""Lacrymae Christi,"" he turned to the duke. ""Vestrae salubritati bibo!"""
The duke raised his goblet.
"""Waes Hael!"" and he drained its contents with a huge gulp."
"""I would chant twenty psalms for that beverage,"" he mused after a"
while.
"The Abbot suggested ""Attendite Populi!""--""It is one of the longest,"""
"he said, with meaning."
"""Don't trifle with a thirsty belly,"" growled the duke. ""In these"
"troublous times it behooves men to be circumspect!"""
"""Probatum est,"" said the Abbot. ""It is a noble vocation! Jubilate"
"Deo!"""
And he raised his goblet.
The Duke of Spoleto laid a heavy hand upon his arm.
"""It is a Vigil of the Church!"""
The Abbot gave himself absolution on account of the great company.
"""There's no fast on the drink!"" he said with meaning. ""Nor is there"
"better wine between here and Salamanca!"""
FANTOCHES.
SCARAMOUCHE waves a threatening hand
"To Pulcinella, and they stand,"
"Two shadows, black against the moon."
The old doctor of Bologna pries
"For simples with impassive eyes,"
And mutters o’er a magic rune.
"The while his daughter, scarce half-dressed,"
"Glides slyly ’neath the trees, in quest"
Of her bold pirate lover’s sail;
"Her pirate from the Spanish main,"
Whose passion thrills her in the pain
Of the loud languorous nightingale.
PANTOMIME.
"PIERROT, no sentimental swain,"
Washes a pâté down again
"With furtive flagons, white and red."
Balt. A half-hour's run down the bay and he clambered from his launch
"to the pile-driver, where, amid the confusion and noise, he made known"
his tidings. The big fellow's calmness amazed him.
"""What are you going to do now?"""
"""Butcher by hand,"" said the fisherman."

A HAND IN THE DARK
While they were talking a tug-boat towing a pile-driver came into view.
Boyd asked the meaning of its presence in this part of the river.

The flush that eloquently speaks.
The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes
Curls from the lessening ends that glow;
"The men are thinking of the bets,"
"The women of the debts, they owe."
"Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes"
"The accustomed smile comes up to call,"
A look half miserably wise.
Half heedlessly ironical.
IN THE HAYMARKET.
"I DANCED at your ball a year ago,"
"To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,"
"“And a glass of bitters, if you please,"
"For you drank my best champagne, you know!”"
"Madcap ever, you laugh the while,"
As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;
"The face is the same, and the same old smile"
Came up at a word I said.
"A year ago I danced at your ball,"
I sit by your side in the bar to-night;
"And the luck has changed, you say: that’s all!"
"And the luck will change, you say: all right!"
"The rain on my garret roof is falling,"
And I am cold and in pain.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And my heart is wild with delight;
"I hear her voice through the midnight calling,"
As I lie awake in the night.
"I lie on my pallet bed,"
And I see her bright eyes gleam;
"She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,"
And made again in a dream.
MUSIC AND MEMORY.
To K.W.
"ACROSS the tides of music, in the night,"
"Her magical face,"
A light upon it as the happy light
Of dreams in some delicious place
Under the moonlight in the night.
"Music, soft throbbing music in the night,"
Her memory swims
"Into the brain, a carol of delight;"
The cup of music overbrims
"With wine of memory, in the night."
"SHAKE out your hair about me, so,"
That I may feel the stir and scent
Of those vague odours come and go
The way our kisses went.
"Night gave this priceless hour of love,"
"But now the dawn steals in apace,"
And amorously bends above
The wonder of your face.
"“Farewell” between our kisses creeps,"
"You fade, a ghost, upon the air;"
"Yet, ah! the vacant place still keeps"
The odour of your hair.
SOUVENIR.
HOW you haunt me with your eyes!
"Still that questioning persistence,"
"Sad and sweet, across the distance"
"Of the days of love and laughter,"
Those old days of love and lies.
"Not reproaching, not reproving,"
"Only, always, questioning,"
Those divinest eyes can bring
"Memories of certain summers,"
energy enough to create more than the delicate measure of a gust of
chamber-music.
A burst of applause followed the recital of a poem.
Noll roused with a start:
"“Come, Madelaine,” said he--“this heavy air is making you faint. Come"
with me and we’ll have some supper.”
She gathered her skirts with wonted grace of gesture and took his arm;
and they made their way out of the room almost unnoticed.
"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"
"drew down his face to her between her two hands, and kissed him."
She clung to him:
"“Thou must give me a bed too,” she whispered hoarsely; “I have no bed.”"
She was trembling.
"“You are tired, Madelaine,” he said."
She nodded:
“I have had no sleep for three nights.”
“What have you been doing?” he asked.
"“I walked about the streets,” she answered simply."
"beginning; a few carriages, and groups of soldiers and seminarians,"
"crowded around the bandstand; Laura didn’t care for brass bands, they"
"were too noisy for her, and she gave the coachman orders to drive to the"
Corso.
_MEETING MARCHMONT_
"They passed in front of the Villa Medici, and when they got near the"
"Piazza, della Trinitá de’ Monti they met a man on horseback, who, on"
"seeing them, immediately approached the carriage. It was Archibald"
"Marchmont, who had just arrived in Rome."
"“I thought you had forgotten us,” said Laura."
"“I forget you, Marchesa! Never.”"
“You say you came to Rome....”
"“From Nice I had to return to London, because my father was seriously"
ill with an attack of gout.”
“He is well again?”
"“Yes, thank you. You are coming back from a drive?”"
“Yes.”
“Don’t you want to come and have tea with my wife and me?”
“Where?”
“Coleman. He lives—”
“I know. Au revoir!” And the girls were alone.
"“There!” exclaimed Miss Decker, “we have got rid of him. Now for the"
"others. You slip upstairs, and I’ll dispose of them one by one. You are"
taken suddenly ill. Teddy will not be back for an hour. Dr. Coleman has
moved.”

"A lamp burned in the sea-room, and the two girls were sitting in their"
evening gowns before a bright log fire. Miss Decker was in white this
time—an elaborate French concoction of embroidered muslin which made
her look like an expensive fashion plate. Jessica wore a low-cut black
"crêpe, above which she rose like carved ivory and brass. The snakes"
to-night were held in place by diamond hair-pins that glittered like
baleful eyes. In her lap sparkled four rings.

"BAH! spite of Fate, that says us nay,"
"Suppose we die together, eh?"
—A rare conclusion you discover!
"—What’s rare is good. Let us die so,"
Like lovers in Boccaccio.
—Hi! hi! hi! you fantastic lover!
"—Nay, not fantastic. If you will,"
"Fond, surely irreproachable."
"Suppose, then, that we die together?"
"—Good sir, your jests are fitlier told"
Than when you speak of love or gold.
"Why speak at all, in this glad weather?"
"Whereat, behold them once again,"
"Tircis beside his Dorimène,"
"Not far from two blithe rustic rovers,"
For some caprice of idle breath
Deferring a delicious death.
Hi! hi! hi! what fantastic lovers!
"To tinker up the old Machine one day,"
"And with a Reckless and Unbridled Tongue,"
"I muttered,—Well, I Wouldn’t like to say!"
"Why, even Saints and Sages would have cuss’d"
"If, speeding through the World, their Tires had Bust!"
"Like Foolish People now, whose words of Scorn"
Are utter’d while their Mouths are Stopt with Dust.

CHAPTER LXXXV
_Wherein a Man of the World commits the Indiscretion of putting his
Experiences into Writing_
"“Dear Noll,” writes Horace Malahide about this time, “I have a son."
He speaks English as yet with a strong foreign accent--but lack of
"experience may have more than something to do with it. If you come,"
I’ll let you play with him.
I live in a whirl of tangled emotions in these days.
"T’other evening I went home, to my father’s marble halls, to seek"
the old gentleman on an affair of hot urgency. It was in the long
hours. I lost some temper--the butler being a sphinx of ducal
"know-nothingness--so I rang up the housekeeper. Yes, she knew where a"
telegram would find Sir Pompey if I would leave it with her.
I!
Leave it!
"Gods! said I, am I utterly disinherit?"
Forthwith the heir of this branch of the Malahides demanded the address.
It lay at St. John’s Wood!

REQUIES.
O IS it death or life
That sounds like something strangely known
"In this subsiding out of strife,"
This slow sea-monotone?
"A sound, scarce heard through sleep,"
Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
About the roots of trees.
"O is it life or death,"
"O is it hope or memory,"
That quiets all things with this breath
Of the eternal sea?
MASKS AND FACES.
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."

The dust of this devouring flame she hath

"""She ordered us to carry poor mademoiselle to her room.  Poor madame!"

That remark caused me to prick up my ears.

"""No, m'sieur; she shed no tears, but sat erect, motionless as a statue."
She appeared unable to realise that poor mademoiselle was actually dead.

We’d make our bed in the bracken
With the lark for a chambermaid;
The lark would sing us awake in the mornings
Singing above our head.
We’d drink the sunlight all day long
With never a house to bind us;
And we’d only flout in a merry song
The world we left behind us.
We would be free as birds are free
"The livelong day, the livelong day;"
And we would lie in the sunny bracken
With none to say us nay.

"Sin deep as she sinned,"
"To be tossed by the storm of her love, as the ocean"

Content to be lost!

"All the world, for one measureless moment complete;"
"To possess, be possessed! To be mockery then to her,"
Then to die at her feet!

"Nights of dreaming, days of loving,"
"When I loved you, when your kiss,"
"Shyer than a bird to capture,"
Lit a sudden heaven of rapture;
When we neither dreamt that either
Could grow old in heart like this.

"Still remember, still regret"
That sweet unavailing debt?
"Ah, you haunt me, to remind me"
"You remember, I forget!"
TO MARY.
"IF, Mary, that imperious face,"
"And not in dreams alone,"
Come to this shadow-haunted place
And claim dominion;
"If, for your sake, I do unqueen"
"Some well-remembered ghost,"
Forgetting much of what hath been
"Best loved, remembered most;"
"It is your witchery, not my will,"
"Your beauty, not my choice:"
"O HANDS that I have held in mine,"
"That knew my kisses and my tears,"
Hands that in other years
"Have poured my balm, have poured my wine;"
"Women, once loved, and always mine,"
"I call to you across the years,"
"I bring a gift of tears,"
I bring my tears to you as wine.
THE LAST EXIT.
"OUR love was all arrayed in pleasantness,"
A tender little love that sighed and smiled
"At little happy nothings, like a child,"
A dainty little love in fancy dress.
But now the love that once was half in play
Has come to be this grave and piteous thing.
Why did you leave me all this suffering
For all your memory when you went away?
"You might have played the play out, O my friend,"
Closing upon a kiss our comedy.
"Or is it, then, a fault of taste in me,"
Who like no tragic exit at the end?
"free from distinct irritating qualities, it should be taken on an empty"
"stomach; as when digestion is going on, the contents of the stomach are"
acid in reaction and if alkalies are given combinations take place and
"salts are formed. If alkalies are given before digestion begins,"
"diffusion of the acid-forming constituents of the blood takes place, and"
in this way the acidity of the gastric juice is promoted; likewise acids
given before meals increase the diffusion of the alkaline constituents
of the blood.

"Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took"
over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!
I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me--and a
girl besides--she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship
jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves
husbands in the one place they're still to be had--the planet
Venus--and you know I'll be in trouble.
"Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into."
"Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled"
out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.

FOOTNOTES:
[17] Translation on pp. 229 ff.
CHAPTER XVII
ERASMUS AT BASLE
1521-9
Basle his dwelling-place for nearly eight years:
1521-9--Political thought of Erasmus--Concord and
peace--Anti-war writings--Opinions concerning princes and
government--New editions of several Fathers--The
"_Colloquia_--Controversies with Stunica, Beda, etc.--Quarrel"
with Hutten--Eppendorff
It is only towards the evening of life that the picture of Erasmus
acquires the features with which it was to go down to posterity. Only at
Basle--delivered from the troublesome pressure of parties wanting to
"enlist him, transplanted from an environment of haters and opponents at"
"Louvain to a circle of friends, kindred spirits, helpers and admirers,"
"emancipated from the courts of princes, independent of the patronage of"
including every reference necessary to enable the searcher to find what
"he wishes without delay or confusion, the mistake of overloading the"
index with useless entries.
"Use ink, as pencil entries often become illegible."
"Write plainly, and do not try to economize space in preparing the copy."

Rays of the afternoon sun in a glimmer across the trees;
"Glittering moist underfoot, the long alley. The firs, one by one,"
"Catch and conceal, as I saunter, and flash in a dazzle of gold"
Lower and lower the vanishing disc: and the sun alone sees
At I wait for my love in the fir-tree alley alone with the sun.
QUEST.
"I CHASE a shadow through the night,"
A shadow unavailing;
"Out of the dark, into the light,"
"I follow, follow: is it she?"
"Against the wall of sea outlined,"
"Outlined against the windows lit,"
"The shadow flickers, and behind"
"I follow, follow after it."
The shadow leads me through the night
To the grey margin of the sea;
"Out of the dark, into the light,"
I follow unavailingly.

"“But there isn’t an aitch in composition,” he said demurely."
"“N-no.” Fosse stammered, becoming nervous. “But he can’t even pronounce"
the names of the ancients whose gods he models!”
Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”
Fosse was puzzled for an answer:
"administration of Aconite, Acetanilide, etc."
"ANTIRHEUMATIC.--A medicine that prevents or cures rheumatism, as Sodium"
"Salicylates, etc."
"ANTIPYRETIC.--A medicine which reduces body temperature in fever, as"
"Quinine Sulphate, Salicylic Acid, etc."
"ANTISEPTIC.--A medicine which arrests putrefaction on or in the body, or"
hinders septic decomposition by killing the germs that produce it or by
"checking their development, as Carbolic Acid, Zinc Sulphocarbolates,"
etc.
ANTISPASMODIC.--A medicine which prevents or removes spasmodic
"contraction of voluntary or involuntary muscles, as Belladonna,"
"Valerian, Chloral Hydrate, etc."
The staff-paymaster spoke seriously. The man was heart and soul in
"his work, and his mental horizon was bounded by official forms and"
other red-tapeism connected with the accountant branch of H.M.
Service.
"""By the by,"" interposed Oswestry, ""Staggles ought to be recommended"
"for the V.C."""
"""What's that, Torps?"" asked Barracombe. ""Our staff-paymaster the"
"V.C.?"""
"""What for?"" inquired the staff-paymaster innocently."
The commander entrenched himself behind a double number of an
illustrated periodical.
"""For bringing Mephisto in out of action,"" he replied with a chuckle."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE FOILED AIR RAID.
"LATE that evening the ""Sunderland"" brought up in the Admiralty"
"Harbour at Dover, in company with three other light cruisers, two"
"monitors, and a flotilla of destroyers. All night long the men slept"
"at their guns, while the cruiser's searchlights aided those of the"
forts both ashore and on the breakwater in sweeping the approach to
the sheltered harbour.

"The ""wire"" was a private tip from a personal friend at the Admiralty,"
informing Terence that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to
bestow upon him the Distinguished Service Order for gallantry in
"bringing H.M.S. ""Sunderland"" out of action during operations off the"
Belgian coast.
"""Torps"" was not far short of the mark, for a D.S.O. almost invariably"
means a rapid promotion to the fortunate and heroic recipient.
"""Flag-rank,"" echoed Terence. ""There's plenty of time for that."
"Meanwhile, that's where duty calls,"" and with a wave of his hand he"
"indicated the distant North Sea, on which the supreme contest for the"
supremacy of the waves will prove that the heritage of Nelson is
still worthily upheld by Britannia's sons.
ABERDEEN: THE UNIVERSITY PRESS
[Transcriber's Notes:
This book contains a number of misprints.
The following misprints have been corrected:
MAQUILLAGE.
"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"
"Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,"
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light
"Gracile and creamy white and rose,"
"Complexioned like the flower of dawn,"
Her fleeting colours are as those
"That, from an April sky withdrawn,"
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.
IMPRESSION.
TO M. C.
"THE pink and black of silk and lace,"
Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
"Powder and wig, and pink and lace,"
And those pathetic eyes of hers;
"One bright delirious moment’s space,"
And then she passed: I followed slow
"Across the heath, and up and round,"
And watched the splendid death of day
"Upon the summits far away,"
And in her fateful beauty found
The fierce wild beauty of the light
"That startles twilight on the hills,"
"And lightens all the mountain rills,"
And flames before the feet of night.
IN THE ORATORY.
"THE incense mounted like a cloud,"
A golden cloud of languid scent;
"Robed priests before the altar bowed,"
Expecting the divine event.
"Then silence, like a prisoner bound,"
"Rose, by a mighty hand set free,"
"And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound,"
Thundered Beethoven’s Mass in C.
She knelt in prayer; large lids serene
"Lay heavy on the sombre eyes,"
As though to veil some vision seen
name given to each being given also to the corresponding time
"division. Thus we speak of the CAMBRIAN SYSTEM, meaning a certain"
succession of formations which are classified together because of
broad resemblances in their included organisms; and of the
"CAMBRIAN PERIOD, meaning the time during which these rocks were"
deposited.

FOSSILS AND WHAT THEY TEACH
The duke regarded his host out of half-shut watery eyes.
"""My own choice is Chianti!"""
"""A difference of five years in purgatory!"""
Thereupon the duke blew the froth of his wine in the Abbot's face.
"""Purgatory!--A mere figure of speech!"""
The Abbot emptied his tankard.
"""The figures of speech are the pillars of the Church!"""
He beckoned to the custodian.
"""Poculum alterum imple!"""
The lean friar came and disappeared noiselessly.
They drank for a time in heavy silence. After a time the Abbot
"sneezed, which caused Beelzebub, the Abbot's black he-goat, who had"
"been browsing outside, to peer through the crescent-shaped aperture in"
the casement and regard him quizzically.
"The duke, who chanced to look up at that precise moment, saw the red"
"inflamed eyes of the Abbot's tutelar genius, and, mistaking the goat"
"for another presence, turned to his host."
"""Do you not fear,"" he whispered, ""lest Satan may pay you a visit"
"during some of your uncanonical pastimes?"""

"These statistics are taken from the report of the British Parliament,"
"which, for learning and intelligence, as a deliberative body, has not"
"its superior, if it has its equal, in the world, and it is surely a"
"sufficiently Christian body to be accepted as authority in this matter,"
since a large number of its members are clergymen. These statistics
"hardly sustain the allegation that ""Infidelity is coupled with"
"impurity."""
"We are willing to stand upon our record. But, lest it be claimed that"
"this is a British peculiarity, allow me to defer to the patriotic"
"sentiment of my readers by one other little set of tables which, while"
"not complete, is equally as suggestive."

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS
"This follows the contents, and is always set in a style conforming to"
the contents page or pages.
INTRODUCTION
"See remarks under ""Preface."""
HALF-TITLE
"The half-title ordinarily consists of a single line, standing by"
itself on the first page of the leaf immediately preceding the first
"page of the text, and carries the title of the book as at the top of"
the first page of text. It is frequently confused with the bastard or
"false-title, which always precedes the title-page. Half-titles may also"
"run through the book before various divisions, but the bastard-title"
never moves from its one position at the beginning of the volume.
LIMIT NOTICE
"If an edition be limited in number, the notice of such limit should be"
placed either on the page facing the bastard-title or on the reverse of
the bastard-title.

"Linus Brein nodded. ""In which case from both sides we must watch our"
steps. Get involved with a seetee race the wrong way and you have two
"cultures with absolutely nothing in common but a life-factor, busy"
tossing chunks of their own kind of matter at one another in a fight
"to exterminate. So before either of you start making half-baked plans,"
you'd better get your heads together and plan something that sounds
"reasonable to the Big Boss. Right?"""

"The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,"
With little mincing airs one keeps to pet
A darling and provoking perroquet.
"Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds"

So vaguely hints of vague erotic things
"That her eye smiles, musing among its folds."

"BY favourable breezes fanned,"
A trellised arbour is at hand
To shield us from the summer airs;

"Afloat upon the summer heat,"

I have done all that I can.
For you and the other one.
I'm sorry.
Hey...
"What do you mean, the other one?"

He came in last night.
He'd been in a car accident.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I have to go.
(SINGING UNDER HIS BREATH)
It's when I'm nervous...
I used to sing that song to my children...
When they are scared...
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
Beautiful story...
Now shut the fuck up.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Shit.
"Hey, hey."

They are Masalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.

I've killed Batman!
Red six on a black seven!
I certainly don't wish to be rude but normally the game of solitaire requires only one player.
"Ha, ha."
"Oh, come on, Batman, cheat a little."
Or it ain't no fun!
Why don't you two kibitzers go outside and wait for Black Widow?
- All that loot.
Sure.
-Yes.
Trap Door!
Come on.
Batman.
- Who untied you?
-I untied myself.
- Was that wise?
-Yes.
And I want you to do me a favor.
- What?
-Sing a song for me.
- Loud.
-Oh.
All right.
Ahem.
- How about some Gilbert and Sullivan?
-Fine.
"Ha, ha."
I'm called little Buttercup
They're about to leave.
"Shit, someone's moving!"
Klein's headed for the squat.

- What's he up to?
"He's drawn his gun, headed for them."
Dennis to Leo.
What is this?
What is this?

"Cops, behind you."
Move in at once!
I said: move in now!
"- Shit, Big Luc!"

Grenade!
"Come on, bitch!"
Drop your guns!
"Drop your gun, pig!"
"Drop your guns, hands on your heads!"
Hands on your head!
"Come along, bitch!"
Let go of her!
Fuck you!
Shut up!
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun.
I'll waste her!
On your knees!
Kneel!
That's better!
"Hands behind your head, scumbag!"
Untie me.
Yes go on.
What are you doing?
There.
What?
What is it?
Stop.
They have been removed in the hospital.
They are dangerous.
Liar!

Hello?
Maybe they're upstairs.
And you think she's still under his influence?
"Yes, ma'am."

They are going to come for us.

"Come on, I lost my wallet."
20 bucks?
"Yeah, that'll do it."

"You gotta light us up, though, huh?"
There you go.

I am thinking simplicity.

It's magic.

Food comes at a price.

Things are the way they are.
Don't fight it.
Just go with it.

Changed my name.
I never told her where I went.
I never saw her again.
I...
I reinvented myself.
But it didn't matter.
"No matter what I did,"
I chose
Angela.
Angela.
Like a name would protect me.
"That I dreamed I could have a life, a chance."
Didn't matter.
It wasn't done with me.
"It's coming for me, Father, I know it."
_
My name is Regan MacNeil.
I'm Chris MacNeil.
I've come to see my daughter.
I don't want to go.
Go home.
You know the way.
I don't want to go.
You'll be fine.
"Trust me, just go."
"You're too young to come, Jesse."
You won't even like it.
*Jesse:

Just go!

Don't touch me!

"- Yeah, sure!"
We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?

- Fucking tart.
That was school French.
You're not from France.
Do you want company or not?
"300, cash in advance."
- What's that?
- 1500.
Say your name is Michelle and say you love me in French.
- And then I'll break your arm.
- Like hell you will.
- 3000.
"- No, I said."
4500.
That's more than you make in a week.
- You're sick.

I'II do anything I want.
Fucking cow.
"I'll get you, bitch."
Hey!

Michelle...
Michelle...
Where is it?
Let go of me!
"Let go of me, bastard!"

Her friend Pia has found her a job.
In a fashion house.
She will be busy in Mumbai.
I don't think so.

He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."

This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.

-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.

"Oh, I'm sorry."
Did I scare you?
"A little bit, but I'll be all right."
OK.
I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

I love you.
I'm saying it again.

"I love you too, you little fucker."
This is wrong.
Is it like I feel with you and Mom?
Is there anyone in particular?
No.

When do we take off all our clothes?
"Ah, Helen."
Helen!
[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.
- l...
I don't give any other woman a chance.
- I've noticed that.
"You know what, Helen?"
Has to run down on fire?
"No, actually."
"He's kind of looking forward to it,"
Because it's sort of like two stunts in one.
"It's a regular fire burn and the stair fall,"
So he wants it for his reel.
So he's kind of looking forward to it.

Our guest has expressed a desire to hear some music on the violin.
All right.
Andrea.
This is Adam Penruddocke.

"Hello, welcome to my home."
"You are that Police Officer, right?"
"You too are here, madam?"
Carry on!
"Ria, you try out this dress."
This is not good.

We must've been hit at the checkpoint.
Under that tree.
"Pull up to that side, pull over."
Okay.
That's good.
"Just keep looking into my eyes, Dad."
You're almost normal.
That's boring.

That is not part of the mission.

"I couldn't stand by and watch her marry another, because--"
"Because she's, you know-- You know, and I'm--"

Hello.

I'll call your insurance.
Why?
You've no right to bother me at work.
I don't.

But I do want your services.

Eva.
No one needs me.
Especially you.
- Really?
You're just a customer.
A very difficult one.
Let's stop playing games.
- Why are you calling me?
Why me?
Because I was crying?
Why were you crying?
That's my problem.
- Maybe I could help.
Great.
I've got me a Saint Bernard.
Please.
Don't compare me to a dog.
Stop!
You can come in!
You can come in!
What was that?
I don't know.
I just know this is what happens if you don't invite me in.
What if I didn't say anything...?
Would you have just kept bleeding...?
You'd have died?

You've only just met.
"OK, Mother."
I'd like to know if it is love between Marco and me.
What do you think?
How should I know?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Watching TV.
Eating.
Could you?
Sorry.
I'll put it back.
Perhaps I should go to the movies after all.
"Oh, come off it."
Stop cleaning up his mess.
What do you mean?
- Any news about your car?
- Small-town cops.
Forget it.
Leave it.
I'll do it.
"Take this, will you?"
- Wow!
- Reflexes...
Shit!
We could spend some more time together.
We could be closer.
I mean...
I could live here.
You and I could do the ski courses together.
But it's different now.
"Before, when you left me..."
I thought my world was about to end.
You know what?
.
I can see it in your eyes that you're happy.
"You'll come to our wedding, okay?"
.
"If I didn't go to Canada,"
If you didn't leave?

-Where could Mrs. Castro's room be?
-Are you okay there?
My gosh!
-Why?

Are you okay?

"My head ached because of it, wait."
"-We had a hard time, good thing we finished it."
"-Oh, is that so?"
-How are you feeling?
"-I'm okay, I lost my headache."
-Are you sure?

"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure."
- You mean it?
"Oh, yeah."
Anything you say.
I knew it.
I knowed I made a good choice!
In what?
My best friend.
"See you tomorrow, buddy!"
"McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,"
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Number one.
Number one...
"Ah, number one!"
"- Ah, this is nice."
"- Hey, Stickers."

You gotta be careful.
I scared myself scaring you scaring me.
"- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared."
"- No, of course not."
No.

When?
Just now?
"What, what did, what did you hear?"
Something about a helicopter ride.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm too far away!
[ Grunts ]
"No, no!"
Look up here!
[ Grunts ]
Hey!
Who's the wiseguy?
She saw me!

"Oh, there's Steven, just flyin' around."
[ Chuckles ]
"No, Amethyst, come back!"
"Wait, can Steven fly?"
"Yeah, I think I remember that."
"No, no, I'm thinking of Lapis!"
"Hey, Steven!"
How did you learn how to fly?
Amethyst!
Go get help!
What?
!
"Ugh, she can't hear me."
"Hey, air-Steve!"
Amethyst!
"I need you to -- dang, too slow."
Better ask quicker.
What'd you say?
"I could really use your assistance dealing with the sudden appearance -- aw, rats."
...of a power which previously was unbeknownst to me which I can't control -- umm.
"Dude, summarize!"
Go get Garnet!
Hmm.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!

It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."

"Yeah, I know."

"Misdeal, isn't it;"
"Oh, have you got six too;"
Five. I could've used another.
HORTON:
"Look, kid, gambling is my business."
Yeah.
And I know my business.
"After this, if I've got six cards, I'll make it known."
Sure.
You bet.
You deal.
-Any of you seen Judge Chamberlain;
"-No, what do you want with him;"
MAN 1 :
His office wants him.
CHARLEY:
Try the bank.
"Forget it, Joe."
He didn't mean anything.
"It's all right, Charley."
"All right, kid, you're the judge."
-Judge of what;
"-Go ahead, deal."
I'm going inside.
You can just stay here and watch for sharks.
OK.
"[Whispering] Yeah, you go."
I'll stay and...
What?
Sharks?
Ariel!
"[Grunts] Ariel, I can't..."
I mean...
"- Ariel, help!"
- [Laughs]
"- Oh, Flounder."
- [Whispers] Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
"Flounder, don't be such a guppy."
I'm not a guppy. [grunts]
This is great.
"I mean, I really love this."
"Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner... [screams] Ariel!"
"[Grunts] Oh, are you OK?"
"Yeah, sure."
No problem.
I'm OK.
Shh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Oh, my gosh!"

Wow!

But I've no wheels.

I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.

- We haven't got that much.
Then I can't help you.
Here.

There's your answer.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come with me.
Let's confirm this.
"Schmidt, how you doing?"
"Uh, not -- not -- n-not good."
I'm -

C-can't -- can't feel my legs.
You look nervous.
Nervous?
No.
"Well, you should be nervous, because if he's lying -- if I learn that he's wasting my time --"
"Hey, guys!"
Come here!
There's something wrong!
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-
- I ca-- I can't...breathe.
He's dead.
You killed him.
What if he was lying?
!
He wasn't lying!
He gave you the answer!
Ask your guy!
Rashad!
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.
"- Oh, I don't have a dog."
- I do.
Lola.
My pug.
- You have a pug named Lola?

Ten rounds of jumping jacks!
"Yo, up!"
Up!

He's in the kitchen with Nicole's mom.
"OK, those two fingers on those..."
That...
Yeah.
Second fret.
Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch...
catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
My name... is Indrid
"Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
"Gordon, all that..."
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
Earthquake in Ecuator.
More than three hundred deads.

What?
Ow.
Well beautiful.
I did not see one like this yet.
"Newer cardboards, Ágika!"
Wow it no.
Not at all.
Our kindest guest humiliates himself with so inferior work.
This can not be.
"Me, not spare, my Mariska."
"Now, when I feel well finally."
"Cardboards, Ágika!"
Here you go.
"If it is for major lord, has desire for him really."
What his blessed hand yes.
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.

- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."

Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."

So you bought a bed.

"- At least, nobody's seen her."
"Alright, now you go back to the hotel."

It's so unlike my wife.
I'll take care of the police and join you as soon as I can.
Look here.
Don't worry.
It's probably some stupid misunderstanding.
"If I find anything out before you get back, I'll telephone you here."

Xiaotian...
"I have waited so long, so will you giving me an answer?"
Can you stop making joke on me?
Nobody's joking with you!
Think I just fell in love.
So we're friends.
Yeah.
You wanna come in?
"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
That's okay.
You can just watch.
"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."
[LAUGHS]

Hi.

[BEN LAUGHS]
Sort of an odd thing to say.
"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
In the back yard.
"What part of ""My dad died of lung cancer"" is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?"
What?
"Do not lie to me, Ben."
"Please, okay?"
Are you serious?
"♪ Rockabye baby, on the treetop..."
It's burning hot.
Bastard!
Are you trying to scald my child?
"Let's go, dear!"
- Madam!
"- Mousy, come here."
"Sifu Wong, I'm innocent!"
I was...

"It means ""OK""."
"Kneel down, quick."
This is my best singing bird.
Here.
You two...
"Watch where you go, girl!"
"Lady, you made me lose my lovebird."
I want you to be my kept bird now.
Return the bird to him.
"Lady, come home with me now."
I'll treat you well.
Now's your chance to impress Sifu.
Go and settle this.
Be brave.
Go.
"Come on, let's go."
Take her home.
"Hey, don't be a bully!"
Your bird is here!

I know how to count though.

I'm older now.
- Yeah.
- Ain't no con game going on no more.

Ain't no more.

"Oh, you know?"
From one sip.
Yep.
So Bob knows it.
Say it.
I'll give you a chance here.
You take a guess.
"Oh, he's giving Rick a chance."
You don't know it.
"Talk to me, Goose."
Get inside me.
Take your shoes off.
Make yourself comfortable.
The wine's inside of Rick.
Getting comfortable.
Okay.
It's a blend...
"Yeah, it's definitely a blend."
I'm getting a few things here.
It's very complex.
"Take another sip, Rick."
This is gettin' good.
"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
I hope you're happy.
He was beautiful.
"Well, whatever."
Enjoy the rest of your ride.
I'll go check the busboys.
Somebody has the chocolate.
Like when you shut it off.
- Jeff Schultz.
Where's your diver?
- He fell off.
Open it up.
"Stand back, please."
Shot in the heart.
Small caliber.
Been in the water 48 hours.
Less. 24 hours.
She's been dead 48 though.
Somebody held on to her a while.
- Who's this guy?
- Tom Hardy.
- Tom Hardy?
- The infamous.
- Uncle Nick.
- How are you?
- How come you never call me?
"- I call, you're always busy."
- Danny's back.
- Where was he all this time?
"California, some place."
- What did he say?
- Nothing much.
You know Danny.
- How are the treating you at work?
- Good.
I read that Rossmore is retiring.
Are you gonna be the next chief?

-Okay.
This was Hill 405 right here.
I'll tell you why.
Zeke...
"All right, this was zero hour."
This is the way it went.
Everybody in posi...
"Gunther, in position?"
"-Right, sir."
-All right.
What are you doing there?
You're with the artillery.
"-Get over there, Tubby!"
"-All right, all right."
"Morgan, get behind the foxhole."
"Zeke, you got the bazookas ready?"
"-All set, all set."

Help!
What's wrong with you?
I thought you're the masked killer.
You're the biggest coward I've ever seen.
Dry the clothes!
Use both fingers.
Why?
It's a waste of effort.
This is our family secret.
Do it!
It's not practical.
Get it.
Who dropped these money?
Money?
It's mine!
I dropped it!
You dirtied my clothes!
I'll kill you.
You've got the wrong person!
- I'll get you.
- I'm innocent!
Where do you think you're going?
- Ah Foon.
- What?
"Look, we're friends."
I'm going to make you brave tonight.
How?
You mean...
It's not as bad as that.
Really?
"You know, we are a team today."
Jin.

"Oh, like that?"
Yeah.
"No, try another one."
No.
No.
No.
No.
You did that one already.
"I know, that's similar but more powerful."
"Try one more. ""Hap hap."""
"""Ninya!"""
Now you're just making up words.
"I'm not, that's Japanese for ""hello."""
It's not Japanese.
Kimaragnas!
She's going to be offended if you do that.
"Rey, hey, hey, hey...!"
I don't...
I don't think we should do the power moves in there.
HE YELLS Konichiwa!
Brilliant!
"OK, good, that's a Japanese word."
Yes.
And one that I'm sure she'll be impressed by.
Yes.

-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?

- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.

I should have stayed with the swarm.
No.

Mm-hmm.
[Janet chuckles]
It hasn't let up for a minute.
I said-

I think you should apologize.
What for?
For snapping at me.
Right.
I'm sorry.
I'd call that perfunctory.
Ursula.

On the contrary.

Nothing.

Oh my God!
It's horrible!
It's hell breaking loose!
I'll close that door.

He wasn't able to come.
I understand.
I'm at your service.

- Hi.
- Did Marissa come back?
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we hot-boxed in Nordlund's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
- He was breathing.
- I hope so.
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
- You the owner?
"- Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like somebody's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
- You're okay.
- Disappointed?
Where you going?
Don't know.
"We both keep our mouths shut, they may never know it was us."
- What are you doing?
What's going on?
What are you doing?
It's a checkpoint.
"Get your head down, we might need to blast through."
- No.
No more guns.
"- Clare, just keep low."
Crawford.
Latif's spy.
What's his name?
"Clare's safe now, is she?"
STONEBRIDGE:
Jacoub!
Stay down.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"Jacoub, keep your weapon down."
Put your weapon down.
(JACOUB SINGING)
"Oh, for Christ's sake."
"No, that's good, it'll frighten the life out of them if they hear us all singing."
"Everyone, sing nice and loud, come on."
(EVERYONE SINGING)
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go!
Just drive.
Get down.
They wanted us dead.
They were fucking government forces.
I told you Matak had us marked.
"Najim, outstanding!"
I didn't think you were going to...
feel that way.
I thought sometime you might want to come over and meet my sons.
Can we do that right now?
"Now as in ""now""?"
Yeah.
"Oh, good."
You're here.
You have to clean all this up.
Come on.
Come on.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Put away all this stuff.
All this stuff needs to be put away somewhere.
No.
Wait.
You're right.
This is better.
More kid-like.
Just play.
Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids.
That's great.
Is that gonna fit in there?
"No, I don't think so."
Maybe you can put it in there.
I guess not.
"It looked like it would fit, but I guess not."
Wait.
Wait.
But I am not that proud.
I am not that selfless.
"I am begging you, please, please, to give her and our baby priority."
"I'd like to help, really, but..."
You can have my spot.
Richard White.
That's me.
Go.
Thank you.
Honey.
"Oh, great."
"We're out of candles, and now the ice cream is melted."
"Honey, please."
Stop worrying.
Stop worrying ?
We're about to be washed out to sea.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I'm...
I'm right ?
I thought I was exaggerating.
I'm going up there.
To do what ?
To go swim out to shore ?
I don't know.
Assess the situation...
figure it out.
I'm your mother.
It's my job.
Wait.
You can't do that.
Why not ?
- Yes.
When?
"No, when?"
Ten minutes ago.
Thank you.
He'll be here soon.
You can sign in here.
Sorry...
- Well?
- Forget it.
"If someone pisses on the slopes, they stage a manhunt... but a stolen car..."
It's like a UFO landing here:
"""A car?"
"""A car with four wheels, or what?"""
"Becky, the keys are in my pants' pocket."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Thanks.
"OK, let's go."
Max!
Of you go!
Next.
I saw something...
A car...
It nearly crashed into me.
"At the last second, I swerved."
It was all so sudden.
There were these lines... like a snake.
Where?
Like waves.
"What are you looking at, you idiot?"
I can't remember!
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Come on.
- Where is it?
- Come on.
- What?
Go.
"Go, go."
Rachel.
Rachel.
Rachel?
( Gagging )
Ra--
Ra--
Ra--
No!
( Sirens )
We suspect a gas leak.
We discovered four adult bodies in the debris.
We assume two were the residents.
We don't know about the other two.
"Ma'am, do you have any idea who they might be?"
"No, I don't."
I see.
What about Mikey?
I saw him go in there.
We did find the skeletal remains of what appears to be a 10-year-old child.
Are you sure?
I'm very sorry.
You're sure?
"When we found the boy out on route 240, he had a bad case of Amnesia;"
didn't even remember his name.
"- Yes, you can!"
- I can't!
- Yes--
"Yes, you can."
Hey!
Damn it!
"You hold on, damn it!"
You hold on.
You hold on.
You hold on!
You understand me?
Hold on!
Here we go.
Come on.
We almost did it.
"No, l--"
No!
Ben!
Come here!
No!
Ben!
Ben!
"You're not dying on me, Ben!"
Not now!
Hey.
I shot the Hell Knight with my plasma rifle but he nailed me with a rocket launcher.
Watch out for the fireballs.
"- Excuse me, Dr. Benton."
- Yeah?
I sorted through the charts and compiled the discharge summaries.
I think your patient has a paraesophageal hernia.
"If you need anything else, I'll be in the Suture Room."
"Mom, you won't believe this."
Something ate our TV antenna.
"- Oh, Hogarth..."
"- No, no!"
I'm serious!
"Oh, but it's not Sputnik, like Mr. Stutz thought."
Hogarth...
"- No, it's a robot!"
"No, really, it is!"
- Hogarth...
Hogarth...
"- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!"
- Please...
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!
Stop it!
Just...
Stop.
I'm not... (SIGHS)
I'm not in the mood.
Come on.
Let's go home.
(THUDDING)
(THUDDING)
MAN:
"A peaceful stay-at-home kind of day, in a town very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly without warning... (EXPLODING)"
Atomic holocaust!
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Hey.
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
(LAUGHS) He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
What are you doing?
Tell him that it's in the petrol tank!
Petrol tank!
It's my diamond!
- It's my diamond!
I have bought the car!
Its mine!
I had come for the diamonds!
- It is mine. - it's mine!
I have the gun!
"So the diamond is mine, papa!"
But petrol tank is not opening.
How to get the diamond?
"One, two, three."
Then..
Heave!
Everybody heave!
What are you doing?
Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
- Vomiting!
I said to turn the car!
- Oh!
Which one?
This one or that one?
His questions and answers!
What do want?
- Give me two batteries.
Which one?
"Big, medium, small?"
- For remote!
- You can do it.
I have faith in you.
- You...
- You what?
- You sw... ine!
- Help!
Help!
- Hold on!
Don't panic!
Don't panic?
!
I can't swim!
Help!
Help!
(Splutters)
What the devil are you doing here?
Day and night service.
I reported your leaky bottom for you.
- Are you all right?
- (Mayley) Yes.
Take him home.
He's a valued friend of mine.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
- Home to a hot drink.
We don't want you getting pneumonia.
Good night.
"Good night, sir."
"Come along, my darling."
Don't call me darling!
I'm sorry.
I should have thanked you for saving my life.
Half a crown?
Let's go.
Call or fold.
Make a decision.
- Can we try to finish?
- I'm 40 light.
You mind?
- What?
"- No, there's no going light in my game, pal."
Come on.
It's more for you if you win.
Doesn't cost you if you lose.
- Go ahead.
"- Aw, man."
- Write that down.
"- What am I, your secretary?"
Yes.
Beat his ass.
- Three nines?
"- Yeah, three nines."
Told ya.
Good.
Good.
You deserve it.
"Hey, I was a fan."
Give me at least half.
Why don't you run over to that A.T.M.
"Yeah, right."
You can finally pay me back.
"Oh, damn."
You know what?
I must have forgotten my debit card.
"Oh, what a shock."
"Stay low, stay close, shoot first."
Got it?
On me.
Do you have the vice president?
"- I repeat, do you have the vice president?"
- We do.
- We're two miles away from Andrews.
- The speaker?
Negative.
We do not have the speaker.
- Please evacuate the Capitol.
- This way.
Excuse me.
Kellerman!
"Carol, COD says we go to the Pentagon."
I have the speaker.
Going to the secondary location.
Watch yourself.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Downstairs, second door to the left."
Emily.
"No, no, no, please."
Please don't!
I was just on the tour!
- You had a gun!
"- it's a phone, it's a phone."
- I swear.
"Look, I got a daughter."
Please.
- Get up!
Okay.
That was close.
"Hey, you been practicing your moves?"
Mm.
You're better than me.
"All right, come here."
Give me a hug.
You be good.
All right?
- Okay.
- What?
What are you laughing at?
- Go to bed.
- Aunt Pam?
Aunt Pam?
- You okay?
- Can you sit in here until I fall asleep?
"- Yeah, of course."
You want me to read you a story?
Or I could actually...
I could make one up.
- You can just sit in that chair.
- So we meet again.
- Your challenge is acceptable.
Prepare for battle.
- I want to come home.
"- Hey, turn it down, man."
- You turn it down.
- I want to come home.
- Move.
You there?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you remember when Carmichael won 24 motos?
"Like, before you were even born?"
Don't blame me if there's an accident!
Make way!
Make way!
Thank you!
"Brother, help me!"
Someone is trying to kill me!
"Brother, someone is trying to kill me!"
Can you hear me?
Damn it!
He's deaf.
You've got to answer my questions honestly.
- Do you know the deceased?
- Yes.
- I don't know him.
- What does he do here?
- He helps the actors dress.
- I don't know.
"Sir, the Marshal has arrived."
Fall in!
Attention!
"Marshal, at your service!"
"Marshal, this way, please!"
I said inside.
How dare you go in without an invitation!
Teach him a lesson!
Marshal...
Loser.
"Yes, Marshal."
What?
You're the Marshal!
"Reporting for duty, sir!"
Full-gun salute.
Yes.
She must have cracked our plan!
Everything's gone!
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.
We have to catch her now.
That is important.
Okay.
Go...
Stop.
- Why are you stopping the car?
Who are you?
- Quick.
"- Sadhana, go."
I'm a cop.
We are in a hurry chasing an accused!
I'm a cop.
- This person is seriously injured!
It's an important case.
At least tell us where the hospital is.
It's within a kilometer.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go fast!
"Is everything okay, Alphonse?"
Yes.
But you keep following them properly.
"Madam, speed up."
Please.
What's happening there?
Nothing.
You keep tracking.
"Tonino, daddy's boy!"
"- Darling, how are you?"
Fine.
- Are you OK?
"Are you OK, love?"
Mario!
- Quirino!
"Mario, you're already out?"
"Damn, that sucks."
"No, I mean I'm glad."
"Hi, Tonino."
- What did you do?
Nothing.
A classic case of mistaken identity.
I'll get a lawyer right away.
- A lawyer?
Are you crazy?
"I'll defend myself, instead send me some goodies."
"Bye, cutie."
- Let's go.
- Remember: no lawyers!
Bye.
"- Croquettes, cigarettes and sweets!"
Poor guy.
- Are you sure that it's a case of mistaken identity?
"Who knows, it happens a lot."
Just look at me.
"By the way, Counselor, we're going to have rename Tonino."
Why?
- Too many Tonino De Santises.
"True, it can happen."
- He's right.
"- Aw, I do like you."
My name is Murray Cornish.
I remember that.
- Do you?
- You're very charming.
- You think I'm going to -
- I think you're a charming man.
"- Da, da, da, da, da."
- [Laughs]
"Yes, I like you."
I like you too.
"You know, you're not making me too fishy."
I'm
- I'm with everything -
I don't let it go down.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Are you going to live with us?
- Here?
- Yeah.
"Well, maybe someday I might."
- Not yet.
- Not yet.
It's not my time yet.
[Vocalizing]
"You could come in with me... with I, uh -with all our guys."
They'd like you.
But I would like you.
[Chuckling]
Murray's on the way.
You get it?
I got it.
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.
Where can I phone from?
Do you have a mobile?
"Well, me and mobiles..."
There's a phone kiosk over there.
"It's my office, but you can use it."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"Sophie, it's Mum."
No.
I'm still at the office.
"Yes, I know it's late."
Tomorrow lunchtime?
OK.
I'll collect him.
You can count on me.
Yes...
"Lots of love, darling."
You too...
Wait.
Wait.
It's...
It's unpredictable.
I'll...
It blocks sometimes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- Sure you're all right?
Unless they've got a special job like you.
"- What about the navy, Billy?"
"- I've been thinking about the navy, but..."
"- Well, I can't swim a stroke."
- Then the air force is out.
- Why?
"- Well, you haven't got wings, have you?"
"- Take these over, love."
- Thank you.
"- All the best, love."
- Thank you.
- All the very best.
- Thank you.
Thanks very much.
Mrs Rose?
"David, darling."
I think I'd better go and get changed.
- Can I help?
"- No, you can't."
"Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron?"
"Tomorrow, sir."
A Spitfire.
I saw her yesterday.
Lovely kite.
There we are.
"Mama, I'm so happy."
"Oh, darling."
- He is a lovely boy.
- Isn't he.
Darling...
"Off you go, Emma."
Both of you.
Next!
You better catch them for me!
What are you doing here!
Line up!
Go!
Line up!
Line up!
Shut up!
You're all useless!
I'm so mad!
Next!
Put down your hands!
It's so embarrassing!
Like a piece of cardboard?
Looks like she hasn't had enough nutrition
"Even though it's a bit flat, but on a closer look"
It's actually not bad.
"Throw at her, it's funny!"
Really?
"Thanks, Master Zhou!"
"Master Zhou, keep on playing!"
"Thanks Master Zhou, thank you!"
"She got it again, throw at her, quick!"
"Master Zhou, come on!"
Stop!
Get off!
Get off!
Are you blind!
"Sorry, sorry!"
Open the door!
Boss!
Open the door!
- No.
Who's all this pizza for?
"Pepperoni, pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
You must love it.
Yeah.
Bought enough for a year.
"There we go, it's all in there."
(tense music rising )
(animal whimpering )

( knocking loudly )
Open up.
What in hell...
Since when do we lock doors?
Sorry.
( clattering )
Why is there a lighter in here?
I wanted to burn some books.
Don't act smart.
( clattering )
(grunts)
Understood.
"Yankee, can you see it?"
Yes.
Do it!
Dropping hellfire.
Started!
Shit!
"How's that, bastard!"
You draw his attention!
"Ram, shoot!"
Shut up!
The GONKU is now inoperative.
Every one.
Good job.
What happened?
Hey!
As expected... it's underground.
Let's work.
Here is today's crucial moment.
"Good night, this is Tokyo Rose."
Your jokes are hard to understand.
Receiving you clear.
Yankee.
From now on we will split and start the search.
Ram and Male search east side.
Ok.
We will turn to the west.
Understood.
Are you going to search with Male's RC?
Right?
It's just for precaution.
I know...
- Just exploring—
- We've been duped.
This girl is not a thief.
- Really?
- Take charge of the situation.
Jeeves.!
Jeeves.!
"- I beg your pardon, sir."
"- Nice work, Jeeves."
I'm a little bit rusty for a former amateur champion.
That's better.
"Allow me, sir."
- Splendid!
"Splendid, Jeeves."
"- Thank you, sir."
There they are!
After them!
- Jeeves!
Two more coming up!
"- Very good, sir."
"- Good luck, Jeeves."
"- Thank you, sir."
Faster!
- I'm sorry about all this.
"- Yes, I know, but we've got to get out of here."
"Downstairs, quick!"
Stop them!
- Jeeves!
Two more on the ice.
- What?
"Again, sir?"
Go on!
We still are...
Husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you saying it.
- Henry.
- His memories are stil catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
- You're gonna love this.
"Because, sir..."
You're gonna get to pick your own voice.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hello, Henry."
- Robbie.
"- Come on, they're options."
Our white guy would wanna sound like Louis Armstrong?
"Just one more, wait."
"Henry, I am your father."
"Robert, enough."
"- Sorry, mom."
- How about we use Henry's voice?
"Yeah, whatever you say, you're the boss."
Boring.
- Security breached.
"- Oh, fuck."
- Level Four.
- Is this a drill?
- What is this?
- Security breach.
Level Four.
What are you doing?
Please stop it.
There must have been a misunderstanding.
I only came here to take over for one night.
Will you just stop that?
Please stop it.
No.
Won't someone stop him!
?
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
Stop it!
"Hey, stop looking so serious."
Let me go.
Mr Muraki?
Ah.
Hello.
Don't you know you shouldn't put plastic rubbish out until tomorrow?
Sorry.
"Oh dear, look at her."
Isn't she looking beautiful?
You must be popular amongst the boys.
"Hi, Chie."
Are you alright?
- Alright?
"- Yeah, fine."
Are you going somewhere nice again?
- We're getting obsessed.
- Really?
- What did the admiral say?
- Say?
About Harvey.
No objection.
"After all, it's the custom."
- Time to find your sea legs.
- Thank you.
- Get your things.
We'll get settled.
- I'm ready.
Harvey.
"Sorry, Mother."
"Goodbye, my dear."
Look after yourself.
"- Goodbye, Mother."
- Wait for me below.
- He'll find things a bit different.
- He's only 12.
Don't worry.
He'll be fine.
How long this time?
A year?
"- Less, perhaps."
"- Only ""perhaps""?"
- I hate goodbyes on the jetty.
- I know what you'll say.
- So I'll take my leave now.
- You left me days ago when you caught sight of the sea.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
God keep you both.
- What do you think of her?
Enough.
Thank you.
Hello.
Thomas.
- I should've known.
I am no longer your psychologist.
Globale blamed you for all this?
No.
Not directly.
They replaced me by Dr Moreau.
They can.
With no reason.
But the girl was...
Eva?
- Yes.
Eva.
What will happen to her?
She was transferred to another sector.
less demanding of her body.
- What?
Another sentence of substitution.
but a longer one.
What does it consist in?
I can't tell you.
Thomas.
Globale forbids you to have any contact with her.
And it's best.
Where is she?
You must tell me.
Listen.
you know.
when we were waiting for the insurance experts.
Understood.
Dropping the hellfire.
Yankee... that's all?
Yes.
"It's a GUNK, isn't it?"
Everyone listen!
Gimlet here.
The bombing failed.
The enemy is getting closer.
As shown on the screen it's a self-supported tank.
"But, we will proceed as in practice."
I will move to position too.
"Male, until then, be the look out."
Male here.
Understood.
I should be able to see it.
It's coming!
Marking it with the laser.
What is he doing?
"Male, are you ok?"
I marked it with the laser!
It looks like we finished the job.
"Male, life check."
All green.
Male.
System check.
It made me run...
All green.
Let's start.
Understood.
Dropping one.
"Yeah, come... 4 seconds until impact... 3... 2 1"
Get them here!
"Wait a minute, sir-500 coppers!"
Four hundred-just 400 a string!
Just 400 coppers a string!
Damn it!
Three hundred!
Two hundred!
I'm generous today!
Now I'm mad!
One hundred a string!
A hundred coppers!
?
Not even a hundred!
Take them free!
Don't leave!
Don't go!
They're free!
They're all free!
They don't cost a cent!
Come here and have some!
Come on-eat as much as you like!
Bastard!
What?
Why are you ruining my business?
You're trying to take my business away?
What do you want to do?
Me?
To beat you!
You'd beat someone!
?
What a hard bean curd!
Bean curd!
(telephone rings)
"- Hi, Camilla, it's me."
- Anna!
- You sound so close.
Are you back?
"- No, I'm way too busy here."
"Yeah, doing great."
- I just wanted to check.
- Don't worry about us.
We're fine.
Everything is fine.
- What's up?
You sound strange.
- I can't talk now.
He's here.
- Johan?
In your room?
- No.
"Oh, good."
So who's there?
Are you still fooling around with Albert?
No.
- A new lover?
- No.
And my other tenant?
Is he seeing someone too?
I bet you're building a little love nest.
"I mean, separately."
"No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment."
I just really miss that bastard.
- Johan?
"- No, for Christ's sake!"

Do not be so a. ..
I'll bring a gift.
"You live with your grandmother, right?"
- How you love
- How can you miss?
"Only last weekend, my dear."
You know I promised
"With this, write the message, and I will answer back."
And we have fun.
Be fine with my grandmother.
- I love you.
- And I love you so much.
I will miss you.
Let the little monkey.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Good-bye.
See you soon.

Wash your hands.
"""PANIC BUTTON"""
Jo!
Is not it?
- Yes.
- Max.
Another winner.
- Ooo ..
Nice to meet you.
- Hello.
I got an MW today.
A Major Warning.
Because I called you at home?
- No.
Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides.
I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes.
I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love.
If you loved me.
you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait.
Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
- He is not much more than a cloud.
I'll come back to you.
I'll never see him again.
Just stop these silly heroics.
You have placed me in an impossible position.
All I have left is a show of strength.
"Besides, women like that sort of thing."
Are you insane?
Pretty dress.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?"
And... one.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.

Ten.
- This man has fainted!
- That man is wounded.
Too bad!
Help us lift him.
Wait!
Come back!
I knew it!
It's the frail one!
"Oh, my God!"
Is he dead?
I hope the damp hasn't killed him.
- Show us your finest room.
Fucking Kraut!
What was that?
Fucking Kraut.
Idiot!
"Only for buses, sir."
-I'll be right back.
"No access for normal cars, sir."
Don't be a nag.
There's plenty of space.
Only buses.
"Drop dead, asshole."
"Yes, one more for my husband."

They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.

He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.

Strange place.
Greetings!
"So you have come, finally?"
Everything okay?
Any trouble on the way?
So these were your men?
What you thought?
"You shall take away my ""would be"" bride, and I shall keep watching?"
I love Faiz!
Your marriage shall happen with me.
"""Happiness blossoms."
"But this world confines all the happiness""."
"""I only have this request of you, Keep them free""."
"""Keep them free""."
"""These are birds of Love""."
"""These are birds of Love""."
"""These are birds of Love""."
The next bullet shall pass through your head.
"""These are birds of Love""."
Sheen!
"""These are birds of Love""."
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Faiz!
- Hello!
- Brother Kadir!
Faiz and Sheen were to get married.
But Shadab got to know of it.
"-Goodbye, Amadeo."
-To you I do not salute to you.
He is amiable...
The cut practiced and the blood has been horrible.
I say to you that it is not possible...
"Boys, you watch."
"Is not the dandy, that of there?"
The dandy?
It seems a closet.
That enormous one?
He comes towards here.
"But, who is?"
We hope that he does not see us.
I already am in charge to flee.
Calm and caradura.
"No, calm and swollen face?"
you do not see as it is?
"Hello, Paulino."
Dr. Sughirini...
Ceggirini...?
-Dr.
Cichhirini?
-Yes.
He is there.
He is.
He is.
With permission.
"When they act thus, it would give a beating them."
It remembers that today we must go to gather the new car...
-Dr.
Cicchirini?
-Yes?
We got any idea who hired this guy to kill Cutler?
"No, but courtesy of his parole officer, we have a current address."
So why don't we go ask him.
STEVE:
Jason Kroll!
Five-O!
I got blood.
STEVE:
Move.
Jason Kroll?
Five-O!
Open the door!
CATHERINE:
Jason?
We know you're hurt.
We can get you help.
But first we need to know that you're not armed.
(gunshots)
He's armed.
(gunshot) You think?
(gun clicks empty)
We need the paramedics right now.
"Right now, Catherine, go!"
"Catherine, now!"
"Paramedics, let's go!"
Okay.
Who hired you to kill John Cutler?
Don't you die on me you son of a bitch.
You hear me?
Hey!
Who hired you?
!
Clear.
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky."
You are clear.
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep."
You are-
- Wait.
Hold.
"- Castle Ground, we are holding."
- Air Command...
- ...switch to thermal.
- Roger that.
Switching to thermal.
"Confirm Sector 5, southeast quadrant clear."
"Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep."
You're clear.
Copy that.
Breaking off for security sweep.
Stand by.
Hummingbird approaching.
"Castle Ground, all clear."
Be it ever so humble.
Atten-hut!
Escort!
"Not a bad way to travel, is it?"
"Beats Dupont Circle, sir."
What time does my wife get in?
- Eighteen forty-five.
- Wake me if civilisation ends.
"- Welcome home, sir."
- Thank you.
"Hummingbird, you are released."
Tell me we don't have the best job in the world.
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
- Bite down.
- I think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
That was bizarre.
Emerson!
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.
- Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
You're looking for typefaces.
"You've got 45 seconds, two passes, remember."
Reveal the hive.
Helvetica.
Helvetica.
Press the letter?
Correct.
Simon.
30 seconds.
Two passes remaining.
20 seconds...
Pass.
"Pass, Helen."
Courier.
Courier?
Correct.
Simon.
"Ten seconds, one pass left."
Five seconds.
"No, you're out of time."
"Simon, you could've passed if you couldn't see it."
I did say.
One pass left.
You were concentrating...
It wouldn't have helped.
It wouldn't have helped!
All right.
"OK, let's see what you got."
"Courier, which is the standard typeface for writing plays."
And is the default setting in Hollywood.
You also found Helvetica.
Do you know where that was developed?
Two minutes to target.
Clear the area.
Get back in there!
The Department of Homeland Security..
Get in there!
This is a mandatory evacuation..
Emily.
"No, please, please, baby."
Look at me.
I'm right here.
Tabriz targeted.
Confirm Tabriz.
"Please, baby, you gotta turn around and look at me."
Damn it.
Evacuate this area immediately!
"We need you to move back, people!"
Move back now!
Emily!
Get out of here!
There's an air strike coming!
My daughter was in there.
Emily Cale.
She's still in there.
Wait!
Emily!
What is with this family?
Wait for me!
Confirm Tehran.
Targeting complete.
Armed for nuclear launch.
You have 15 seconds to initiate.
"Fifteen, 14.."
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leave it.
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
"Look, I don't believe you're ill at all."
You just need more strength.
Take mine.
Really.
I have too much of it.
- No.
- Yes.
I want you so.
- No.
- Oh!
Forgive me.
I... fear that we would harm the memory of our beautiful afternoon.
Yes.
"Yes, of course."
All right.
Who's taught you to be afraid?
No wonder you're choking to death.
Someone's got to show you how to breathe.
Come on.
Come on.
You need light and air.
You need to move about.
Why stay inside wrestling with perfection?
Come outside!
Perfection is flowing all around you!
- MALLEFIILLE:
George!
- No!
"Run, Chopin!"
- Excuse me?
- Yes.
I won't kill you here as you deserve.
And are still talking.
"We're still here for you, brother."
-Go ahead.
-All right.
It starts with a loss ...
"No, no, no."
Sorry for the moment passed.
"I forgot what I was going to say, maybe tomorrow."
"No, I'm sorry!"
"Is not flowing, the show is over!"
"-Please, sir."
What?
Their story is about flight?
-Where are you?
-From the land of the emperors.
And what's your name?
Erik.
In Insvelândia had many brave warriors
Erik called.
-Seriously.
"Yes, of course."
Everyone!
"Your attention, please."
"I dedicate my comforting much celebrated saga to my brave friend, Erik."
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
It begins with a story ...
From my home!
Hecomesfromanextinct Penguin Race  yourworldveryquickly came to an end
The power of flight was what saved me
"Bye,Sven"
You have to come back to me!
"Do you hear me, Josie?"
Josie!
Josie?

Don't!
Don't!
Please don't lock me in here!
Don't!
Please!
No!
I just want to go home!
Please!
Lies.
Lies.
Lies!
I said her name.
I forgot.
It's all right.
"Garcia, were you able to trace it?"
No.
I was so close.
But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I just sent that to your phones.
"What's this area like, Sergeant?"
Mostly blue-collar residential.
What about that area?
It looks pretty secluded.
That's where the old railroad spur line used to come into town.
Mostly just abandoned structures out there now.
We're on it.
There.
Bulma-san
Bulma-san how old are met?
How rude!
Why do you ask me that?
!
well ...
I expected no less of a millionaire!
Goku has good friends!
Is it true that we have a plane and a castle as bingo prizes?
You are right!
But the special award is much more amazing!
Krillin!
We are three with Maron!
which is the second prize!
Huh?
Want the second prize?
Is there anything wrong with that?
I did not mean that ...
Goku is not here at this moment in time!
Why was he training ?
!
Are you going to let him see bingo prizes?
Goten!
This way!
Sorry!
Darn you!
What the?
let's open!
Yes!
Are these all bingo prizes?
it is too early to be surprised!
What is this?
I'm sure Dad would have been here if he could.
[SNIFFS]
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"-What happened, anyway?"
"-She banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't go to the rodeo?
[STUDENTS CHUCKLE]
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

[BANGS TRAY ON TABLE]
-You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
-Leave me alone.
I just mean-
"- I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
At the power station.
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-really?
"See anything unusual, Hogarth?"
Nothing...
"... unusual,really."
Gotta use the bathroom.
Strange he's tightIipped.
The other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
A hundred-foot robot?
That's nutty!
What else did he say?
"No, wait, stop!"
Excuse me.
What is going on in there?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
"You know, this sort of thing is why it's so important..."
... toreallychewyourfood .
A little privacy?
!
Sorry.
Sorry.
He's been acting strange lately.
That hurt.
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'II see each other again real soon.
If you're gonna stay here...
Hooray!
That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
"Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?"
The gelt?
Please.
Mmm!
"Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, say."
You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
"- What's that, a halter?"
- Yeah.
Hmm.
"Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one."
There you are.
Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails.
Hammers and saw.
Look.
You bought 'em yourself.
What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing.
Get out.
- Mmm.
"Oh, hey, listen-"
There's something we did forget - a medicine kit.
"We need some iodine and quinine, just in case."
Now I'll make a call.
- Zoravar.
- Yes.
Were you waiting on the pole?
Yes.
Contract canceled advance returned.
Very fast.
Darling Ankita.
Go inside.
Ankita hold on.
Did you have to interfere?
Hello.
I'll come straight to the point.
Do you love Shiv?
I...
Hey.
Move aside.
Your brother wants to get you married to that moron.
- Moron?
- Look at his face.
Do you love Shiv?
Yes.
Do you want to marry him?
Yes.
Yes!
Don't be mad.
He has an entire army with him.
The Boss announces a contract... to get Shiv and Ankita married.
But Boss how can you start the contract... without advance money?
This is against your system.
- You're right.
- Yes.
"Carried away all my stuff,"
For the bride didn't care!
What's up?
Did you wind it up?
No.
Guys from our fish factory gave it to me.
"As a joke, they wrote on it:"
Don't oversleep the fishing season.
"It works alright, but rings whenever it likes."
Excuse me.
Are we almost there?
"- Maria, may I call you?"
- All right.
- Shall I give you a lift?
I got a car.
- No.
Come on!
Come on!
"Fast train number 71 ""Bogachyovo — Suvorsk"""

The train stops for 5 minutes.
Cars numbered from the tail.

"Oh, my God!"
"Careful, mama!"
Hi!
Welcome!
- When are the exercises?
- Tomorrow.
I was traveling in style!
Do you wear glasses now?
"Juliette, wait, wait."
"Okay, Juliette."
Monroe is going to show you something right now.
- Nick.
- Just wait.
"Now, Juliette, remember, what you're about to see is just me."
Juliette?
"- Oh, God."
- What happened?
What did I do?
I-I warned her.
I told you what would happen if--
"Look, this doesn't have anything to do with you."
We have to get her to a hospital.
"Oh, dude."
[Glass shatters]
[Woman singing in foreign language]
We're canvassing the area hoping to find someone who's seen the suspect.
"- Yeah, I've seen him."
- When?
Checked in this morning.
"Paid for three days, cash."
What room is he in?
Ma'am?
Hey.
"Hey, stay where you are."
"Robinson, stop her!"

Congratulations.
"Well, thank you."
Hey.
Hey.
So we made an A.
Did we really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's cool, right?"
Congratulations.
It was the best grade in the class.
Thank you.
"Also, I made you something."
"I sensed a bit of reluctance on your part to embrace the cheese that is power metal, so it's your very own power metal mix."
Wow.
It's actually...
"You said, ""Parking lot mix"" on here."
"It's like heavy metal parking lot, you know?"
Do I have to listen to it in a parking lot?
"No, cars, bedrooms, whatever."
Bedrooms.
Wow!
Sweet.
Whatever.
Anyway.
But it was nice seeing you.
I'll see you around.
"Well, I appreciate it."
"Bye, guys."
Yeah.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Yeah.
"I was very, very hurt."
I'm kidding.
"Brown, take the brown ones."
Don't take the white ones or the
Red ones.
Why brown?
Because brown is the
Ibuprofen.
The red and the white ones are
Left over from when I was
Seriously addicted to pills.
"Well, why didn't you just"
Throw them away?
Because I'm sentimental.
About pills?
Sarcasm.
"All right, so, uh, the red,"
Right?
Brown.
Brown.
Gonna take the brown.
Tell me he's not color blind.
I hope not.
Are you sure there's not
Anything I can do?
"Honey, come on, look."
"You handle the kids, right?"
You drive them to
And from school.
You take them to their games.
You do their laundry.
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Man, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
"- Damn right, it's an error."
POLICE OFFICER:
Unless he set you up.
- (GUN CLICKS)
"- Hands above your head, please, miss."
Wait.
Why?
Possession of stolen goods.
He left you holding.
I have nothing.
"Sorry to tell you, but your boy took off."
Probably in Canada by now.
He called in a tip.
Told us to take a look at the surveillance footage at the train station.
Give me the watch.
Now!
You know your rights?
EMMA:
Yeah.
Good girl.
Turn around.
Where's the rest of the watches?
Gone.
They're not coming back.
Let's go.
EMMA:
"So, it's just in here somewhere."
HOOK:
Allegedly.
"Give me a boost, would you, love?"
So I can't see what you're pocketing?
No way.
You are too... a child.
It's dangerous to go alone!
I wonder if it is God's messenger.
Kill me...
I beg you....
Kill me...
This are the demon seeds...
Before they birth...
Kill me I beg you!
This is terrible....
Terrible...
Please stop it!
Don't look away.

You prayed for help...
You must believe until the end...
But...
If you pray...
Pray for death!
Devil!
Shoot!

Thank you!

What is this white bear?

You may not believe it...
"Well, when you get discharged... what will you do?"
"Jin-san has been here for so long, he well deserves a big payroll."

Interesting.
Sammy OK.
Bring the family.
- Please.
Please.
Leave my family.
"- You stole from us, Sammy."
"- No, I did not steal."
"- Chan, caught our malımızla."
Chan works for you.
Now the whole damn family will die.
- I did not do it!
- We do not have to do this.
Do you know Mike?
You're right.
You Sammy'yi shoot and I'll leave her family.
- Please.
- What happened?
Tekledin?
You fucking prick!
"Sammy'yi shoot, or I'll kill her child with her husband."
- Shoot him.
- Will not do it.
- Shoot them!
- Vurmayacağım them!
- The death of his wife he want children?

"- Will not do it, vurmayacağım them."
Has no meaning.

- No!

It'll go.
BRYAN:
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it.
Hit the beat hard!

In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man."
I...
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Okay.
- Who?
Finnerman?
I won't let her.
"I couldn't protect you before, Allison."
But I can now.
"Dad, what have you done?"
You weren't supposed to see this.
You should go.
"Dad, no!"
No!
"Help us, someone, please help us!"
Protect... protect the innocent ones.
No!
"No, Dad."
"Hey, stay with me, okay?"
You're gonna be okay.

I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to insult you.
But how can they impose that on you?
I chose.
What do you mean.
You chose?
Between a long sentence in prison and this.
This was shorter.
Because...
That way.
They'll give me back...
Look.
I can't talk to patients about this.
I mean outside...
If they were to find me...
- Is Eva your real name?
No.
I can't use my real name anymore.
- What is it?
I can't give it to you.
Come on.
It's just a name.
You don't understand.
I'm in prison.
There are rules.
It's bad enough as it is.
If...
Look.
I have to disconnect.
"Now, put it to good use."
I'm on it.

"Careful, Smithers!"
"That sponge has corners, you know."
- I'll go find a spherical one.
- You changed your mind?
- They saw your gun and your wire cutters.
What can I say?
Hope is contagious.
- But Death Valley...
- We have a plan.
"We, uh... cut the phone cords and the power to the watchtower lights first."
- Safer in the dark.
- George!
Wait.

"Danny, I'm sorry, lad, but we can only take five."
I want to help.
No.
Stay inside.
Stay safe.
Lifted it from the guards' latrine on cleaning duty.
What's it for?
Protection.
I won't allow it.
"Don't do anything daft, Danny."
How long does it take the guards to reach the far side?
Two minutes.
"OK, then."
"Two minutes from now, we run."

- Invitation to a party
I told you.
It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash
And then we'd all be charred alive after supper in a dinner-hall fire
"Look, boys."
- Where...?
He's the one
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?
Us?
Or the waiters?
- For me.
Rocky shut your trap
Why did you have to call him?
"You know Sheena, haven't I seen you before?"
Me?
Really?
Where?
- At Robbie's party?
You might've.
I go to so many parties
You know Sheena...
- What?
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes?
Really?
Whom?
My grandmother
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano
You know how to play the piano?
Gone.
They've gone.
Where'd they go?
To the mountains.

Allow me.

"It's okay, Xiao-Mei."
"Spare me, I beg you!"
"Mr. Cheng, let me go!"
Let you go?

"Brother Jeng, you're going."
You will come back?
Just as soon as I can.
Really?
"Of course, and then I'll take you to see a doctor."
Take care.
Let's go.
See you!
See you.
Hello?

"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
- Yeah.
Enough of doing it that way.
"All right,so..."
"Now, Claudia..."
Okay...
"Now, focus."
Don't just write it.
Believe it.
- No...
- Yes.
I will not disobay Arite.
How long you been working on that?
Since I lost my father.
"Artie, I'm sorry."
When did he die?
"Oh, he's alive."

"I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass."
HENRY:
"Bridger, press down here."
"He's bleeding down here, too."

ANDERSON:
They're torturing the bastard.
The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.
(SCOFFS)
Pulling through?
You saw what that grizz did to him.
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.
"Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that."
Toward you and twist it into place.
I'll hold him.
Go.
Pa.
Hold him.
Go.
Go!
Now!
He passed out.
I'll take advantage and stitch up his neck.

"No offense, guys, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
- No.
"That offer's expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
I'm telling you!
No one owes me money!

You're useless.
Have you collected the money?
I've collected...
Some more clothes.

Take off your clothes.
I'll wash them too.
It doesn't matter.
Take them off!
Money?
Where's the money?

- What happened?
- His phone rang.
- You didn't take it off him?
"- Yes, but..."
- The signals interfere.
- I know I switched it off.
Maybe he did something while I was out of the room.
An oversight.
Won't happen again.
The incoming signal must have interfered with the upload sequence.
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.
Then went dead.

You said he shouted something.

Good night.
I want that in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon this afternoon.

Fine.

It's insurance.
You don't come to us very often.

"Well, we will help you."
-Lie down in the sofa.
-Comfortable position.
We are going to examine you.
"-Lie down, trust us."
We undo this...
"-Everything, Doctor?"
"-Yes, it is better."
He already is...
"The next time, a bad zipper"
I'm answering all your questions.
You're a fucking sadist is what you are.
A little.
"Wait, look."
Wow!
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Look at these features, huh?"
"I mean, the fucking cheekbones right here?"
Are you kidding me?
I look like an angel.
- Look at that.
- [Camera shutter clicks]
[Laughs]
Babe.
"Oh, you look good."
Thank you.
- [Air hisses]
- Drew:
Try it.
That's original flavor.
I'm pregnant.
I probably shouldn't.
"Ah, it's harmless."
Every ingredient on that can is natural...
Or a near-perfect synthetic match.
"Okay, drew, I've got a lot of other meetings with sponsors."
What do you want to do?
I love Ryan.
You know that.
But I was at his last fight.
He did not look good.
"- Oh, my."
Now that's going to leave a mark.
[Pants]
All aboard for the transdimensional express.
Huh?
[sighs]
Why me?
This can't be good for my cold.
But this is no time for selfish thoughts.
It's time for a little turnabout.
Ew!
Can you get any more disgusting?
Don't make me come in there.
Wait a second. [sniffs]
Smells like... ambush!
"Mucal invader, is there no end to your oozing?"
[Pants] Adaptor!
[Pants] Adaptor!
Adaptor!
Thanks.
I've had enough chasing.
"It's your turn now, Thorozpog."
Thrakkorzog!
Thrakkorzog!
"With a K. Boy, are you ever rude."
Eat your brain!
No brains today.
"We're only serving humble pie, Whatchimozog."
"- Listen, for the last time it's..."
- Thoraxinabog?
- Thrakkorzog!
"- Ah, Laxativelog."
Was that a person?
Wife
The rat fell into the trap.
"You all right, baby?"
You Okay?
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leaveit
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
- A week?
- Sorry?
A week?
"Yes, that's right."
It strangely matches.
What does?
Cute.
What breed is your dog?
"You see, her appetite for dogs..."
"I mean, her attachment to dogs is strong."
She hates it when others get near her food.
He's a half-breed.
We're raising him for the summer.
I'll be going now.
Do you mime as well?
I'm sure the murderer is one of them.
- Wait!
Wait please!
- You foolish kid!
Please stop!
You can't kill me now.
Why not?
That detective.
He's suspicious of you all.
Suspicious?
He's noticed that you all are foxes.
What?
How do you know that?
By what evidence?
"Yeah, he's lying."
I'm not lying.
Please listen to me.
You want to be reduced to an arbitrary number on an arbitrary scale?
- You are trying to get me.
- Not trying.
Succeeding.
"- And spectacularly, I might add."
- You realize I hate you right now.
"Come on, ladies!"
Come on!
Show me something down here!
"Oh, life's a fight, people!"
Let's see some fighting spirit in here!
"Just five more, soldier!"
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Five!
- Two comes after three!
Four!
Three!
Two!
One!
I can't believe he sat on me.
- Is that a common occurrence?
- You haven't taken Benny before?
- No.
- He gets off on being a hard-ass.
- It's my first week.
"- With those arms, bro?"
You could have fooled me.
- Nice to meet you.
Chad.
- Kevin.
I'll watch myself.
Just give me a chance to prove myself.
I'm different now.
Really.
I'm ready.
I can do this.
Okay.
That's the kind of confidence
We've been waiting to hear.
Yes.
Okay.
We will.
We'll give you a chance.
We're gonna start out with two weeks
And then we'll check in on you.
"And if that goes well, then we'll give you two months."
"And then if that goes well,"
- You'll be free.
"- Yeah, two weeks."
Yeah.
Okay.
So you can leave here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.
"Listen, i really believe in you."
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
So go out there and make us all proud.
Make yourself proud.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
"Good luck, monica."
Is it still beauty?
Thank you for letting me know.
Your real look!
So I thought...
I also should tell you.
It's my real look!
My father was the same.
Bald head!
- Xiao Xue!
- Xiao Xue!
Bald head.
What can I do for hereditary?
It's okay.
Don't cry anymore!
I'm sorry!
"I wish one day,"
I can use my own design to build my own garden!
A place as nice as paradise!
"In that paradise,"
- will I be there?
- Of course!
"Because of you, it becomes my paradise!"
Oh!
Wait...
"When I'm graduate, let's get married, how is it?"
- Hello!
"- Xiamu,"
Xiaotian is leaving tomorrow...
Come to have dinner with us!
Xiamu?
Are you still there?
"Someone stands beside you, would it be me?"
"- ""... and we feel she would benefit"
"""from a more challenging curriculum."""
- (laughs)
- Huh.
I know!
"All these years we thought that she was, uh..."
"- God, what's the word?"
- Different?
Peculiar?
Odd?
- Mean?
- So many words.
But... she was just really smart.
"Holed up in her room every day after school, she wasn't..."
- Plotting to kill us?
- I was gonna say daydreaming.
They... they want us to tour the school today if possible.
- This is so exciting.
- I know.
- Our little baby's a genius!
- (doorbell rings)
"You know, um, I also skipped a grade."
"I'm not saying I was a genius, but..."
"Good, because we're getting along so well right now."
"- Oh, hi."
- Hi.
- Hey.
Mwah!
- Hey.
- Here you go.
Yeah.
- Thanks so much.
"Pull me up, please!"
- What a nice country road!
- Don't look down!
Hold on tight!
That's it!
That's it!
Now!
Like that!
Good!
A bit more!
Thank you.
"So, we've arrived."
"But I'm afraid, not where we were supposed to."
- According to the plan we should be...
- Let's check it out.
"- Come on, please!"
- My transmitter has disappeared!
What did you want to transmit anyway?
That we landed at the wrong place?
- That's all we know.
- Leave that to me.
What's this?
Against the cold.
- Maybe we pressed the wrong button.
- Why?
Did you press anything?
- No.
Emilia!
Katya!
I see flowers!
And bees!
I thought they only existed in fairy tales!
They see here.!
Taking!
We are going to chain you.
"Away, cheater!"
"Old cheaters and putas, outside here."
It is necessary to denounce to him.
Also the other patients...
do not kill all.
"Lift up, lift up, still you are healthy."
You will already see tonight.
I do not hold more!
I do not hold more!
"Dr. Cicchirini, he has died."
"It doesnt matter, we put him inside and we take him to the morgue."
They have killed him.!
Assassins!
We will denounce to him.
We denounce to Dr. Cicchirini!
-Yes?
-Cicchirini?
-Dr.
Cicchirini.
-Police.
-Police?
-We have an arrest order.
An order?
For whom?
"We go, walks, you do not resist."
"We go, assassin."
Carrion.
"-But, I am Dr. Cicchirini."
We know
Go!
"I'm being removed from my own helicopter, ladies and gentlemen."
The first margarita's on me.
Not so fast.
Did you get it?
Did you?
Yes!
I want big!
I want cinematic!
I want...
I want Pennebaker.!
Get this.
Get the copter.
You smell that?
Do you smell that?
"Nothing else in the world smells like that, son."
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know one day we had a hill bombed.
"When I walked out, we didn't find one of them."
Not one stinking dink body.
But that smell.
That gasoline smell.
The whole hill.
It smelled like... victory.

-
- What?
-
- Shouldn't you wear a vest?
-
- You what?
-
- Never mind.
Go back to automatic pilot.
-- (MUSIC GOES THROUGH HEADPHONES) -
- Thank God they've gone!
"""Shouldn't he wear a vest""!"
Huh!
-
"- Vests are out, man."
-
- Yours is.
I can see it from here.
-
- Let me handle this.
-
"- I wish you would, Granville."
Hi!
"Something we can do for you, man?"
Don't listen to the golden oldie here.
"He's, like, from yesterday."
"You and me, we know where it's at, right?"
"By the way, love the open shirt."
"That's very me, the open shirt."
Soon as I get out of this clobber I'm straight into the open shirt.
Porter.
Have you heard of her?
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.
"Excuse me, Gunther."
Mmm-hmm?
What's down that way?
That wing is forbidden for a woman like you.
This way.
This is a...
This spot's reserved.
"Oh, anywhere is fine."
Oh... mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
If you need any...
"Anything at all, you..."
Oh.
Thank you.
Isabel.
Isabel.
Isabel.
I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. cairn.
Oh.
I wanted to make sure that all your needs are being seen to.
"Oh, yes."
The institute is lovely.
I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
I feel better already.
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
"- Whatever, bitch."
"- Hey, watch your mouth."
"Are you almost done, man?"
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
"- That means she's okay, then?"
- No.
She could wind up paralyzed.
"- Like, all over or just her legs?"
- They' re not sure yet.
"Well, better if they just killed her, you know?"
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
"Yeah, that was personal."
"It was about my name, honor."
- But paralyzed?
That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
"Hey, Luka."
"- Piece of work, huh?"
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No.
Do you?
Not really.
Come on Prewitt.
"Come on, cut that out."
You want to see this guy's imitation of Mussolini?
"Come on, show him your Mussolini impersonation."
Italian men... Italian women!
For twenty centuries...
"Sorry, I can't."
"Cut that out, Prewitt."
What are you doing here?
Don't you know it's forbidden?
It's a minefield.
Get lost.
Get that bitch out of here!
"Out, out!"
Can you get that Italian bitch out of here?
- Get out bitch!
- Enough!
Are you here to fight Germans or to insult Italians?
You're killing them!
"Out, out!"
Go!
"- Step aside boys, move!"
- The medic's here!
It's too late.
Nothing can be done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pasqualino!
Pasqualino!
- No!
No!
Is everything alright?
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
I can't get my bearings.
You need a stiff drink.
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.
BALLROOM
These things still go on!
Anyway...
Where'd that guy go with my suitcase?
- You got conned.
So they stole that too.
Now I have nothing left.
Oh well.
At least you can't lose anything that way.
"Well, well."
Biberkopf!
You've been gone a long time.
A beer and two patties.
Coming up.
- Wait.
- What?
Let me.
So you help out here?
No male admirers around?
"- No, none."
"- In that case, another beer."
Cheers.
Who's that with Cilly?
"A beer driver, maybe."
Can't believe she'd go for that type.
His name's Biberkopf.
I know him from before.
Just out of prison.
[âª]
(rennes:)I will render my decision shortly.
[âª]
"Recover the astronomicons,"
Eliminate bailey and fox.
[âª]
"By now, da veiga must have"
Handed over the dagger and
The scabbard to the gural nataz.
Yup.
They've probably decoded the runic
And have sent out their goons.
Probably.
Do you have to agree with everything I say?
Sure.
[wind blowing]
"Syd, look."
[door unlocking] [door slamming]
Guard!
I don't want him in here!
I don't think either of us have a choice.
I gambled and lost.
[âª]
"This rock,"
It's different from the others.
What are you thinking?
"It's been brought here,"
Quarried elsewhere?
This is sarsen stone.
Just like at...
Stonehenge.
Hah.
Excellent!
What's wrong now?
You've suffered internal injuries!
You're joking!
Touch your rib cage.
Does it hurt?
No.
No?
What about this spot?
"Yes, it hurts a bit."
"You've breathing problems, too."
"Yes, how do you know?"
I think you trained much too hard.
I must try to relieve your tension.
You'll be okay when that's done.
Does it hurt?
No!
It doesn't!
What's wrong?
"It doesn't hurt, does it?"
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
It's burning...
Stop it!
It won't hurt.
Have you finished?
Feeling better?
You're great!
Of course.
You dare to hit me?
How many hands you want to use?
You're magnificent!
- She's beautiful.
Toss your oars up.
We should say goodbye.
"Once we sail, we won't have a chance to talk."
"Goodbye, Father."
"Goodbye, Harvey."

"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Mr. Crawford."
Boat ahoy!
"Captain's jolly boat coming alongside, sir."
- Full company aboard.

This is Midshipman Crawford.
You must be proud to serve with your father.
Take the captain's son below and introduce him to his messmates.
Stand by to hoist.
Pass the word that Crawford is to be treated the same.
"Understood, sir."
Lots of women aboard.
"Wives, I reckon."
"Hello, my love."
Who are they?
Them?
They're the pressed men.
Follow me.
"Bye-bye, love."
Get those wretched women off!
- Hoist away!
- Dawlish!
Swing them over!
- Clear the deck!
- What?
"Cousin, cousin, where did you find Mickey?"
In a train.
- What transport?
- Me
Are you an innocent?
I could say I'm a virgin man.
Not for long.
It hurts.
I bleed.
"No, you're enjoying it."
That's me bleeding.
You come when I will.
Ready?
"Leon, do not expect."
"Forget the address, forget everything."
Mickey is doing well.
Begone!
I'd like to ...
I can not ...
Yes?
Do not give money here.

We want to see.
"We come, you lie down anatomically, like tenth we."
-It already is.
-It already is.
"What thinks, colleague?"
"I would begin by one ""intramuslus rigidum""."
Previous or later?
That depends on the availability of the patient.
Exact.

It hurts here?

-All to regulate.
Passive insensibility.

-No...
-No?
"What thinks, colleague?"
-Colleague?

It is the same sensation that I have.
I propose that we deepen.

"""Aprovechemus""."
"Now, you pay attention."
"Tell me, What notices here?"

-Good... for pleasing.

"An injection makes lack of ""mine-dura""."
And of mine no?
"Yes, yes, carry out, carry out."

He requires an emergency operation.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm too tired.
Then there's the weekend.
I'll operate on Monday.

We didn't do it!

One guy is on a chopping spree inside
What are you saying sir?
What is happening there?
Break open
What were you doing out?
Ramanathan where are you?
- My phone fell into the water
Can't you pick the phone?
Don't shout without knowing what happened.
- What happened?
Did someone die?
- Worse than that!
- What?
I'm using the phone that fell into a commode.
Alphonse...
- Look how he is responding...
He is screaming at me.
- Ignore him.
Did you trace their location?
- Shall we leave?
Okay.

You seem to be very clear about what you need.
I'm the confused one running after you repeatedly.
Driver.
Start.
Go...
Hey!
She has swept his account clean.
Thank you.
"She did see us, right?"
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Have you eaten?
You want beer?
I put in fee for you.
You want in?
Please do!
- I you peel an apple?
- Useless.
So I bring you an appetizer .
Where is Light?
I go.
Wait!
What?
It's rare that you come .
You work your administrative competition?
What happened to you?
Nothing...
I aim for mayor of the city.
"Even if I fail, I not go into the police."
I understand.
Wait.
The murderer...
What?
What murderer?
"No, nothing."
This type of case will still continue...
Just like your difficulties.
I will not go on again tonight...
Take care of the house.
Young man.
What are you doing?
Good then.
Are you nuts?
Stop.
What is going on?
What's going on?
- We want our mother back.
- What?
We want our mother back.
Are you nuts?
Have you lost your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You are not our mother.
Go to your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I'm tired of this.
"Anything else, perhaps?"
I want you to repeat ten times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mother.
- More convincing.
You're my mother.
Look at me.
"You're my mother, you're my mother ..."
Harder.
You're my mother.
Stop this nonsense!
I'm not playing anymore.
Understood?
There is only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
Where can I contact her?
Look.
If you continue to harass me.
I'll have to report it.
Where is she.
Damn it?
- You're going too far.
Tell me where she is!
- I don't know.
Because of you.
she's in the hands of a judge...
Yeah.
I know.
What do you know?
- The madam called you and complained.
Indeed.
Madame Zoe is threatening to sue us.
I don't give a damn.
Think of all the consequences.
You could be sued for...
Yeah.
Where's the girl?
The prostitute?
- Yes.
The prostitute.
Don't you know you're forbidden to even ask the question?
I don't care.
I love her.
You understand?
I'm your insurance company.
I speak in the name of the company.
OK.
I'd get the witch hazel.
"And I'd say, ""Witch hazel?"
"""What are you, 90?"
"Get some fucking painkillers."""
"And I'd say, ""Hey, it's an excellent astringent,"
"""and we're out of aspirin."""
"I'd turn the argument into a good, hard, angry fuck."
"Well, that's where we might have a problem."
What do you mean?
I've got... a bit of a problem in the downstairs department.
What?
"You know, downstairs."
What?
!
Where?
!
"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
- My cock doesn't work!
- What?
My cock doesn't work!
Hi...
He's watching us.
"We can't help it, Sid."
No.
"It's OK, isn't it?"
Isn't it?
It's fine.
We're fine.
Fine.
OK?
- I'm fine...
- And dandy...
Where would we be if not for private clubs.
Out of work.
[laughter]
Right.
Totally unacceptable.

"Oh, Burke."
"Is the scene really essential, Burke?"
Would you do without it?
This damn thing doesn't make sense.
It's perfectly plain.
You're a teacher.
You don't want the building torn down.
"Come on, I can read."

Listen carefully.
Your mom might sometimes say that you were Karan-Arjun in your past life.
- No.
Mr Thomas.
Can you tell me what you remember last?
Well.
I came out of my apartment.
and I walked...
My head was spinning and I fell down.
After that.
I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it.
Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What?
You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes.
But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen.
Mr Thomas.
you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes.
like your girlfriend claimed.
He didn't?
He was murdered.
Skinned.
It was never solved.
The colleaguesthink that it was a kind of
"Personal vengeance, because the murderer or murderess took several days to skin him."
"Now guess who left New York a day after the murder, even days before the press found out."
She lied to you.
Probably from the beginning.
She played with you like a cat with a mouse.
She screwed you and whoever worked with her.
Where is she?
Where is she?
- Who?
No.
No...
Where is she?
Wait!
Where is she?
- No.
"Please, don't."
No.
This won't get you anywhere!
I'm meaningless.
You didn't accomplish anything.
[Sighs]
What?
[Ding]
Morning.
Did a package arrive from booth Allen in Chicago?
Could you please tell John that I called?
Hi there...
Your mom or dad home?
Yes.
Mom!
What?
"- Sorry to bother you, Ma'am."
What's this about...?
I'm afraid there's been an incident with one of your neighbors here in the complex...
"So we're just going around, talking to people..."
see if anyone knows anything...
What kind of incident?
"Owen, why don't you go to your room...?"
"- Sorry, guys!"
- you wonder?
- what?
why do you need glasses?
so dangerous?
- Hey!

Well can I borrow your keys...?
- Faiz!
Sheen!
Sheen!
Are you fine?
What have you done?
Jumped from the vehicle?
What if something happened?
Nothing will happen to me.
I thought I would be separated from you.
I could never bear that separation.
And I jumped!
"Tell me brother, do you need some help?"
"Can we get a place to stay, somewhere?"
A place to stay?
It's some distance from here.
It's difficult to find transport here.
"Sit on my bike, I shall leave you there."
I am going that way.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Come on!
"- Okay, come!"
"Go inside, there is place to stay here."
Okay!
Thanks!
Hello!
Is anybody there?
- Sheen!
- Look how beautiful it is.
But there is no one here!
Can't find anyone.
Let's look inside.
"Well, it's going to better use there."
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?
- You lie to us.
You lie.
- Dad!
Stop!
- What are you doing?
!
- You go behind our backs.
- Stop it!
- Why?

Does this book tell you to do that?

"Yes, but this may be a false alarm..."
"See you later, Romlin."
"But, I would like to continue..."

Let's search for a good place...
"Bad luck, Grunzi is not here."
Let's search for a good place anyway.
"For that, we hop out here, here over the ice - and then,"
"Hope you know a good place to live because, uh--"
Whoo.
Dear Lord.
Heh.
I'm looking to make a new start.

Dear Lord!

Amy:

Amy:
Dr. Niven's got me working on this Higgs bio-entanglement simulation.

Just detach the scope module.
Yeah.
Wow.
"Yeah, I would look so cool walking around,"
listening to my iPod with this fucking thing on my head!
"It also advertises that,"
"""Parents will love what they don't hear""."
"It says ""While the LaserScope surrounds the player with the sounds of exciting gameplay action,"""
"""non-players can listen to music, read a book, talk on the phone,"""

It's Act of God.
"You want money, don't you?"
Go and ask God.
Take him away.
Act of God.
Just a second.
Just a second.
Leave me.
Act of God.
"So, you believe in God."
- Yes.
You believe that God is present everywhere.
"ln him, him, that madam, him."
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.
And me?
"Mr. Dinesh, you believe that God dwells in me too."
Yes.
Thank you.
Act of God.
I didn't do it.
God did.
It's 'Act of God'.
God slapped him again.
I didn't do it.
And now God will shoot you..
And you will die.
"Later, will your family get the claim.. ..or will that be 'Act of God' as well?"
"How nice to see you, Georgia."
I was just picking up some onions for my mum.
"Well, you know your onions, don't you, Jas?"
You've been eating organic food for ages.
Cool.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"This is my friend, Georgia."
- I'm Jas.
"- Hi, I'm Tom."
Do you need something for a sore throat?
"- So, what school are you two at?"
- Ridgley.
Ridgley?
"Me, too."
Just started.
- Here you go.

That's all right.
Can't let my brother work hard serving good looking girls without a cup of tea.
Sorry?
- Apples.
She likes apples.
- Great.
"About a pound, yeah?"
"Robbie, this is Jas and Georgia."
They go to Ridgley too.
Okay.

"- Yeah, some mates from London."
Kanji.
- Yes.
How will you fight the case?
That's simple.
"lf your Lord can appear in the temple.. ..from 9-12 and 4-7, then he's free from 12-4."
He can appear in the court at that time.

Tell me.
"Agreement, affidavit, anything you need."
I will make it.
Come with me.

"So, Mr. Bhagwan"
Surname?
Surname?
He must have a last name?
"Sharma, Verma, Kapoor, Khanna, Desai, anything."
"Don't know, because we haven't met."
I see.
No.
- You two haven't met?
No.
- That's fine.
What's his crime?
It's been sabotaged.
Someone did this on purpose.
(Footsteps in the distance)
James:
That could be her!
Connor:
"James, stop!"
Amy:
James!
Connor:
James...

(Amy cries) (Monster continues struggling and growling)
James:
Jesus Christ Matt...
Matt:
I... what else was I going to do?
"(Monster continues growling, gurgling and struggling)"
Amy:
If they're all like that we're screwed!
Amy:
"There were like, what, 30 people in this section?!"
Connor:
We'll find a way out.
"James, which way?"
God bless the lnternet.

Ai-yi-yi.
- Do it.
Take it off.
"- Oh, my God."

Ohhh !
"Oh, thank you, God, for this wonderful, wonderful day."

"This is, like, the coolest thing I've ever seen."
- I know.
- [ Both Snicker ]
Can you believe-- This is definitely one of Stifler's best ideas ever.
[ Jim ]
What is she-- She's touching my stuff.
- Why is she touching my stuff ?
- [ Finch ]
"Man, let her touch."
- She's going through my stuff !
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.
- Oh.
"- Oh, no."
"Oh, no."
"- No, no."
"- Oh, nice collection there, Jim."
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna--
Just go ahead and get un-- get changed.

- No.
You are just in time.

"Oh, my God !"
This is too much.
[ Finch ]
"Oh, did you see ?"
"Oh, there that goes."
"Oh, geez."
"No, Jimmy!"
"Jimmy, please."

Jimmy!
- What's wrong with you?
Easy!
"Take it easy, boy."
- Calm down!
Who's there?
- I'll come now.
"See, what Jimmy has done."
I was afraid of this and it happened.
Few of my men have accompanied me.
Send them upstairs.
I'll manage the rest.
"- Okay, sir."
"Sir, he took those tablets again... ...that doctor had warned him not to take."
"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
"It'll be like, something that he'll do [INAUDlBLE]."
TED LEO:
And then I will have to kill him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That's your thing.
BETH HOYT:
"Not that we know if that happens, you know."
It wasn't said here.
"Next comment from YouTube, this is"
"Cee-Lo, String, or Prince."
TED LEO:
"Well, obviously you want to bone Sting because he's all that, the Tantric stuff, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You have a week to spare?
TED LEO:
Exactly.
"Yeah, maybe you don't want to bone Sting, actually."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You do not want to bone String.
TED LEO:
Lose your job.
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, exactly."
TED LEO:
You'd be evicted while you were having sex.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You'd miss so many meals.
I'd kill Sting.
"Exactly, where's the food?"
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I'll wait outside.
- I love you!
- Are going to cry now?
Lower the seat some!
Are those brats following us?
It looks like the car from the errands center from last time.
What.
Hey.
Wait for me
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
- I think my husband might have put a tail on me.
- No.
It's my husband.
Drives me nuts.
- Hey!
This isn't gonna work.
"You, get off here!"
- Here?
There aren't even any buses.
"Get out,Hurry."
"If we get caught together, we're dead."
- How can I get out in this speed?
- Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"- Uh, no!"
"- Get out, you dick head!"
"Slower, slower."
Get out.
"Yeah, you moron."
I knew it.
You did put a tail on me.
"Yeah, and it wasn't us!"
This couldn't happen from the control room.
Connor:
No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.
Connor:
The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.
Kate:
I...
I don't like it down here.
James:
It's not too far.
(Distant scream)
Amy:
What the hell was that?!
Kate:
Probably a steam valve or something... right?
James:
Probably.
Kate:
How much further is it?
James:
It's not far.
Matt: ...Great.
Matt:
Just as i was starting to get freaked out.
James:
"Look, I'm sorry."
I thought that...
Matt (Interrupting):
Do you know where we're going or don't you?
Amy:
Matt...
I don't get it.
I just don't.
How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation ?

Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is ?

"Well, um, if you guys see him later, will you tell him Courtney says hi ?"
Bye.
- [ Scoffs ]
- Okay.
Explain.

"Yeah, I know."
"I'm working on it, all right ?"
James ?
"You are very good in the world history class, yes ?"

The Crown Prince?
Yes.
Crown Prince.
Your Grace.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Shall I call for Yuning?
"No, I came to see you."
And how may I be of service?
Go see the Crown Prince.
I'm certain you can convince him.
The Crown Prince.
He's not in.
What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"
Your Grace.
We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
"Okay, I'm done."
It's yours.
Your folks...
Hello.
"Kerim, we've arrived but we don't know where to go."
Where are you?
I don't know...
We've followed the road signs but...

Come pick us up from here.
Fatmagül...
Pull yourself together.
"It's OK, don't be afraid."
You've just passed out.
Calm down.
Don't be afraid.
Is your foot too bad?
Where are they?
What's happening over there?
Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack:
Is that a rip? man:
"Why don't you film down there, Jack?"
Let's see if we see a cup.
"Come on, that's it."
Jesus.
"You're not a student now, you know."
You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack:
Yeah.
man:
"Two small beef burgers, believe it or not."
Imagine what the large ones are like or the medium ones.
"Ridiculous, isn't it?"
Unbelievable.
"Anyway, here you go, Jack."
This way.
I'm gonna sit in the car.

What if he hears?
He is deaf.
Come sir.
"You sit here, and you sit here."
What will you take?
- I don't want anything.
Where did he go?
- I am here.
Why do you always do this?
- Did someone fall again?
"Not there, he fell here."
"I offer a chair, and you make him fall."
"Sorry sir, but he cannot see."
But he is good at his work.
Hello.
"- Not here, do it here."
Hello.
"- Not to the door, here."
Hello.
"- Come quickly, don't leave me alone with him."
We're coming.
"We'll be there soon, right Mukaddes?"
Almost there...
We missed the ferryboat.
But it's OK.
Are you crying?
But don't cry.
- Fatmagül's crying.
"- Come on, wrap it up Rahmi."

Nice clean shave.
"Good job, buddy."

Sasha:
This is not clean. man:

You survived it.

What day is it today? man #2:
BETH HOYT:
Exactly.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
And you hear that accent every morning when you're drinking coffee.
BETH HOYT:
I was just picturing going out for dinner and being like--
JULlE KLAUSNER:
It improves your life.
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
"And it probably would improve your posture to be with him, too."
I feel like you would just
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Sure.
"And you kill Pierce Brosnan because, did you see ""Mama"
"Mia?"""
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, that's exactly why."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
There need to be consequences.
BETH HOYT:
Yeah.
He needs to pay for that.
And we're going to make him.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Someone does.
BETH HOYT:
You guys got it?
"Go nuts, we're going to be back in a minute."
But first it's a My Damn Channel original video premiere.
It's the Jon Friedman Internet Program with Donald Trump.
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Good luck!
I'm so sorry.
Never mind!
You sing very well.
Really?
You heard it?
"Yes, I did."

What?

What?
He means to say you've got a melodious voice.
Great!
- What?
He means to say you sing so well.
- Oh!
That's great!
You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."
But it's not good to move around freely.
"Yes, I know."
You've got a zero knowledge of music.
I am also a police officer's daughter.
"Every day, they've got only one job."
Arrest!
Attack!
Arrest!
Attack!

[ Vicky ]
Kev ?
I think we've come...
- a really long way since homecoming.
"- Yeah, we have."
Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it ?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
"Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it."
"When I say it, I want it to be more than words."
- You know ?
I want it to be-- - Perfect.
- Is it hot?
- Yes.
It's very good.
Have some.
No.
I'm full!
Drink it.
"If you don't, it'll expire!"
Give one to your father.
"We better finish the pike, too."
One more day and they'll be bugs.
"Hey, Sunghee, come here."
Now what...
"- Have some milk, too."
- I don't want any...
"Yes, you do."
It's going to expire.
I get diarrhea.
Just throw it out!
Brat.
Throw it out?
Why would you throw food out?
Drink up!
Flip over the kimchi that you've eaten!
Flip it over yourself.
It's too bright.
Wait!
- Tell me a story.
-What story?
Any story.
What kind of story?
A racy one?
Yes?
I've done the rest of the accounts.
Thank you.
Have a nice weekend.
You too.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Help!
What are you doing?
I don't want to.
Stop it.
You're hurting me.
Stop it!
What are you doing?
I don't want to.
You're hurting.
Stop it immediately!
- Leave me alone!
- Have you gone crazy?
Let Ricarda go.
Come with me.
Come on.
He... he locked the door.
The pervert!
The perverted bastard!
- That's really awful.
- I didn't do anything.
I can see the state Ms Limmer is in.
I was faster than Rex.
Because you shut the door in his face.
"Strange, that."
Maybe it was the wind.
God doesn't exist down here.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Pablo.
Wake up.
It's a boy.
A boy.
My son.
"Yes, a boy."
Your name will be Pablo.
It's an internal hemorrhage.
We haven't got the equipment here to help.
"We've done our best, but if he isn't operated on within 6 hours, he may die."
There's internal hemorrhage.
Notify the ER.
"Let us take care of him, OK?"
He's going to the ER.
We need your details.
I'm Malena de Luca.
That's my brother.
We came from Barcelona because my father's dying.
He's here!
Let go!
He's going to kill my brother!
Pablo!
Pablo!
Let me go!
Shit!
Pablo!
He's going to kill my brother!
Pablo!
Take it easy.
I didn't tell you...
Amy:
Mum let it slip.
I was waiting for you to tell me.
Kate:
It's nice to finally meet you as well.
Amy:
Are you coming with us?
Kate:
I think so.
James:
Yeah.
Amy:
Ok.
James:
Shall we go?
Connor:
So... why have you thrown your evening away to go on shift?
Kate:
James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...
Connor:
Oh... sorry.
Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:
And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?
Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.

Life is bitter.

I'm going to stay at your place for a few days for your punishment.
No.
My husband hates it when you visit.
No he doesn't.
He's just acting like it.

"Still, the only person I love is you."
"You know that, right?"
"You too, for 3 years!"
- Wait.

-What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
And it's a miss.
Will takes... down his second target.
He's slightly in the lead of Paul.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Missed.
Paul:
"Sheez, I can't see."
NARRATOR:
Looks like he has some problems with his safety classes fogging up.
And it's a miss.
Will has a miss on his third target again.
Let's see how Paul's going to catch up.
Paul:
I can't see it.
NARRATOR:
Paul's hit his second target.
Paul:
I wish I had a machine gun.
"Will ""Big South:"" See it."
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Yeah."
NARRATOR:
Here we go.
"Michael ""Hitch:"""
That was good.
NARRATOR:
And Will has hit his third target.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Will!"
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Will!"
NARRATOR:
Rob is off to the second stage of the challenge.
"How did he get here so fast, Johnny?"
How?
How?!
"Now, don't talk, Gus."
Save your strength.
"I spoiled it for you, Johnny."
I spoiled it for you.
"If you hadn't listened to me, you would have been all right."
( sighs )
All I want is to do one good thing.
One big thing.
( coughing )
"Take it easy, Gus."
"Look, Gus, take it easy."
( sobbing )

Patrolman spotted the car.
Graham and Randolph.
They're heading for the waterfront.
They?
Says there are two in the car.
Maybe a hostage?
Maybe a friend.
I kept wondering why Kimble would wanna catch that plane.
He's had plenty of chances to leave the country.
"I understand the situation, but if you could help..."
Yes...
Just a moment.
Dad.
Don't tell Mom about it.
I heard that his mother has cancer.
"Your dad's a doctor, right?"

Why?
Does someone have it?
No...
Mom...

Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.

Kate:
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:

James:
So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.

James:
Got... what working?

"I know we just met and all, but..."
"-We're really sorry this is happening to you, Orange."
You seemed like such a great-- [crashing/crumbling sound]

-Whoa!
That guy doesn't monkey around.
[laughs]
-How did that thing get in here?

I kept calling you.
You didn't recognize my voice?
"Come, let's go."
Mohit from Agra.
Hello!
"What happened, Kishan?"
- Nothing.
"Jackie escaped, sir."
We don't know where he has gone.
Kishan!
"What happened, Kishan?"
Kishan!
Blood!
You got injured and you didn't even tell me.
Let me rest for some time.

It seems the goon's bullet's has passed through his hand.
There was a heavy bleeding.
For now I've stop his bleeding.
But his pulse is going down.

Give him one packet every hour.
Yes.

Father's inside.
Hello.
You seem to be in trouble.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
"Honey, could you turn that down?"
WHOA!
Dammit!
My ankle!
Oh yeah!
I didn't want to trip on them.
Ow!
"Sweetie, is your car running OK?"
"Yeah, why?"
Great!
I'm fresh out of gas.
I'll take yours.
I'm late for work.
(DlNG-DONG!)
Just a minute.
Oh!
"Hi, Marla."
We need to talk.
Come in.
What happened to your ankle?
Getting out of bed this morning ...
Tripped over Barry's golf clubs.
Yeah.
Happened to me many times when we were married.
I still wear a brace when it rains.
"So, what's in the box?"
I thought Barry cleared all of his stuff out after we got divorced.
I was cleaning today and I found something.
What is it?
You're not gonna like it.
Like what?
"Well, all those years, I knew there was something."
Catch him.
There he goes.
Catch him.
"Don't let him go. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Here comes Govinda... """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Don't let him go, catch him. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
"Go that way. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Let's sit down and talk.
All I did was file a case.
lf you try to talk they'll cut you in half.
Look behind.
Catch him.
Faster!
Who are you?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.
What?
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.
So you're from UP.
You can call me Kanhaiyya.
Catch him.
Careful.
Careful.
"Careful, slow down."
Slow down.
Are you a man or a stuntman?
You can call me a stuntman as well.
But people call my stunts a miracle.
Miracle.
- Hold on.
You aren't wearing a helmet either.
There he is.
Connor:
Same place as last time.
Amy:
Same place as what?
Connor:
Cracked my skull climbing.
Connor:
They had to put a metal plate in my head.
Amy:
You never told me about that.
Connor:
It was when I went home for a few weeks.
Connor:
After Prague.
Amy:
Oh.
Connor:
I didn't mean it like that.
Connor:
Just give me a minute.
Connor:
And I'll see what I can do with the terminal.
Connor:
Is there anything up there?
James:
"There's a door, it's secure."
There's no one about.
I think we're safe for now.
Connor:
All right.
We'll stay here for a bit.
"I'll try and get through the firewall, see if I can get any help."
"Hey, even the card companies give you three months."
"You can give me three months, can't you?"
Let's meet on Saturday for sure.
Okay?
Saturday!

Is there a forecast for rain today?
Well... the report has just come in.
"Sorry, Soo-jeong."
It'll be clear today too.
"Oh, I see."
I'm right here.
Mom!
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.
- And your homework?
- I did it.
- And the diary?
- Of course.
"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
You have an atom bomb.
- Where is it?
Here it is.
- Here.
Here.
- Wait.
Kishen.
- Dad.
"Kishen, give me my gun."
Who are you?
"- Your father, you fool."
Dad.
"- Sorry, Father, I couldn't recognise your voice."
But I instantly recognised you when you called me fool.
Stop blabbering and pass me my gun.
- Here Father.
"Careful, Father."
Careful.
- Wait there.
"Stand just like that, one behind the other."
I will need only one bullet that way.
Let me see who saves you two today.
I will save them.
Grandma.
"Careful, grandma."
This glass piece might've hurt you.
"Rai Bahadur, what's going on?"
Why are you scaring these innocent children?
Innocent children?
"Look, what they've done to my plants."
"I know, I made them cut the branches."
Why did you cut the branches?
Who is he?
His name is Venkat.
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.
Thank you.
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.
Are you Venkat?
Yes.
Boss is calling you.
Get in to the jeep.
- Which boss?
This territory has only one boss.
Bhadram sir.
Why does he wants me?
Hey!
He got some work.
Shut up and get in to the jeep.
The boy is with me.
You go.
I will drop him at the house and follow you.
Who is he?
He is talking opposite to what we say.
Put both of them in the jeep.
Come on.
What is this?
Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.
"Narin, please..."
Narin!
Narin!
No Narin!
NO!
It is not going to end like this...
This is not going to end like this.
1...2...3...4...5 1...2...3...4...5

Your life won't be like this.
I promise.

Haven't you left?
How could I leave you?
I am not leaving.
I am here.
Don't do it.
Don't...
Don't cry...
I feel very ashamed before you.
Don't tell anybody.
I promise.
I won't tell anybody.
"But you have to promise me, too..."
"Whatever happens, don't give up on life."
Life is very valuable.
"You saw the bottom of the pain, Narin."
Not you!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

Inspector Damodar speaking.
"Yes, this is Uma."
- Oh Uma?
How did you make a call here?
I got this number from the police station.
What's happening actually?
"Nothing, I'm on duty."
Cover your drape.
What?

Not you.
"Yes, tell me."
Where's Radha?
She has gone to the youth festival.
She's coming back tomorrow. she's fine.
Why are you getting disturbed?

Do you miss me?
"Yes, I do."
Do you miss me?
"Yes, I too miss you a lot..."
That's why... cover your drape.
What's wrong with you?
What are you blabbering?
I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.
Don't stare at me.
- Did you hit my friend?
- I didn't.
I did.
Just get in the ambulance.
Go.
Don't make me hit you too.
Go.
Hurry up.
This is amazing.
How's the sea?
It's alright.
Really?
I was thinking about going.
"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!
I'm so sorry.
I know.
The doctor said that you're gonna be okay.
He said it's just gonna take a little time.
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's not safe for us here now.
"- You all right, mate?"
- How is he?
He's hanging in.
"So, what now?"
You let Tommy know I want a straightener.
- Tomorrow.
- All right.
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.
"Ike, your mate runs security at Trinity Wharf?"
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him.
Set it up.
Sure.
Come on.
What's going on?
Ben and I are on the noon flight to Boston.
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.
"- You can't do this to him, Shannon."
"- Yes, she can."
She has to.
Then who the hell are you?
I'm...
I was sent by Jun Young-ju.
Jun...

That name sounds really familiar...
Is it you?
Are you her new guy?
"No, I just..."
She sent me...
"Shut up, bastard."
Tell her this.
If she's got something to say.
"Beat it, punk."
What now?
Young-joo wants to breakup.
The excessive violence...
"Get lost, bastard!"
"Get a life, you shit."
-What?
"-Wait, wait..."
I delivered the message.
You heard it?
No I didn't!
Keep your nose out of other people's relationships!
"I don't deal with relationships, only break-ups!"
Go!
Beat it!
"Hey, I didn't hear anything."
Get lost!
"You don't get it, do you?"
"You listen to me, god damn it!"
Moron.
Have you been walking all this time?
Stupid..
"Ugh, again with that!"
Crap...
I'm dying here.

It's totally laid out.
- So does that make you happy?
Why are you hitting me?!
You are pissed off again..
"Ah, hot hot."

Why he...
Wow...
I told you my major was Astrophysics.
We make spaceships so a car's nothing.

-You funny.
"Oh, no!"
Get out!
- What.. -Jump!
What kind of person is your husband?
A good person!
But we don't love each other.
"My husband's a good person, too."
"He had an affair and so I did, too."
And that's howl ended up like this.
Who is it?
Uhjjoo!
"No Ri, you too!"
She's recognized a dummy!
These guys...
Melong (sticking tongue out/ way of teasing)
Hey!
Baek Eun Jo!
Chef!
Are you worried about something??
Oh!
Your face has a look of concern.
"Oh, are you finished?"
"Yes, of course!"
I cleaned everything.
Good job.
"Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?"
Huh?
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?
You can go home now.
"Yes, Chef."
I'll be leaving.
Okay.
Good work today.
- Get home safely.
- Yes!
"Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature."
No Ri gets fevers very often.
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.
"So, you should have been more careful around him."
"If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?"
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
Lee:
So I got Chili Mac.
Paul:
I got Train Wreck.
NARRATOR:
Both these dishes are time-honored Boy Scout classics.
"The Chili Mac consists of ground beef, chopped onions, diced tomatoes, macaroni, cheese, and water."
"Train Wreck is a one-dish breakfast with bacon, sausage links, hash browns, and eggs, all mixed together with plenty of syrup."
Paul:
I hope you guys like what I make you.
Child #1:
"If we don't like it, you're going home."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"""
"Ho-ho-Ho, the attitude."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I know."
"All right, guys."
Go get to it.
Lee:
All right.
Here we go.
NARRATOR:

Whoo-hoo!
Stir eggs scrambled with hash browns and thoroughly cook.
Children:

Paul:
You have to jump!
Twilight:
I'll never make it!
Pinkie Pie:
You'll be fine!
Twilight:
I will not!
(hydra roars)
Pinkie Pie:
I-i-i-t's your only ho-o-o-o-pe!
(hydra snarls) Pinkie Pie:
You have to take a leap of faith!
(Twilight gulps)
(hydra snarls)
(crash) (Twilight yelps)
No!
Oh no!
NOOOOOO!
(bubble pops) (Twilight screams) (Twilight grunts repeatedly)
(Twilight shakes off confusion) (ponies cheer) Pinkie Pie:
"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:
Huh?
Spike:
What wasn't what?
Someone else gave my mouth a six and one third.
What's wrong with my mouth?
"God, I'm having a nervy B."
We've only gone over the plan a gazillion times.
You don't need to have a breakdown.
Just stick to your lines and we'll be fine.
Okay.
How's my hair?
Very Keira Knightley.
"Just get in there, you minger."
"Remember, lower your voice so you sound sexier."
Okay.

Red ones?

"- These are nice ones, these are."
- Great.
What are you doing?
Jas?
"Hey, Jas."
Quelle surprise.
What a shock to see you here.
I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.
- The ocean!
- Really?
-You'll be back by nightfall.
Which ocean?
A tumbling open Ocean
We need to be careful.
Since your husband's is cop.
The back seat!
-Why the flowers?

What's this?
You didn't wear any?
Getting bold.!
Why?
Are you cold?
Cold wind is getting in underneath.
"- Next time, let's really go to Manila."
- Don't joke.
- You don't believe me?
- No I don't.
Shall I make reservations now?
"In the summer, we'll go."
Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?
- It only takes him 30 minutes to get home.
Be nice and drink it
He's coming to.

Come here.
Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!
Rub my back.

"Come, dear."
Come!
Rub my back.
Why are you rubbing it softly?
Do it with pressure.
That's good!
Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
- Look out!
- I can hear someone breathing.
- Where?
- There's nobody there.
"- I tell you, I can hear like an owl!"
"- Hey, Mitrofanova."
"Such an important uncle, and you are making a Babylon of your hair!"
You know what I'm saying?
"- All right, Marat."
Go on.
- Maybe it'll sting through the shirt?
- Off with it!
"- And your pants, too."
"- Oh, come on!"
"- What, you think epidemics leave tan lines?"
"Rash all over, except the butt?"
"- Go on, then!"
"- Come on, guys, can't we do it all together?"
- We can!

"- Come on, guys!"
For the win!

Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."

Take a look.

Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."

Where are you going?

Get down.
Play it.

Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."
"Chintu, careful."
Papa.
Get down.
"Papa, we're practising."
Today's 'Janmastami'.
You've your exams tomorrow.
Who will write that?
Get down!
Why do you always stop for religious things?
He'll be absolutely fine.
My son's playing Govinda.
My son won't become Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
Mahadev.
- Coming.
- Let's go.
- Come soon.
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from.. ..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.
"Now, watch how I sell it for 10-12 thousand."
And keep one idol from each on display.
- Okay.
Understand?
- Yes.
Come on.
One and only one piece in the world.
This idol appeared from the ground.. - Yes. ..when the temple at Badrinath was being built.
What are you saying?
Mitrofanova.
"It's her uncle who's coming, after all."
- Quiet!
- The worst is that tomorrow is Parents' Day!
"- Whatever, they all just come to swim in the sea."
- And his grandma?
- Look out!
"- Back to beds, you lot!"
- You're right.
Kostya's grandma will be here tomorrow.
- Where's my grandson?
Is he putting on weight?
- But he's not here.
Can you imagine what happens next?
"- Hey, guys!"
We need to cancel the Parents' Day!
- Do what?
- Cancel it!
"- Yeah, like you can cancel it."
"- We can claim that, since it's ""Parents' Day,"" only parents are allowed."
- Right.
"- No, seriously!"
"Right now it's grandpas, grandmas, uncles, aunts, and what have you!"
Like they have no other place to go.
- Got it!
I got it!
- What?
- An epidemic!
- What kind?
- Nettle!
- Pull.
- I've got the short one.
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll prepare some mango juice for you.
"That's the problem, Kishen."
You don't have to make mango juice.
Why?
"- I helped you, didn't it?"
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Give my life?
"- No, no."
"- Yes, I can give my life."
"No, no, no."
- I will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to do a small favour for me.
"Yes, tell me."
Remember Mala.
Mala.
That witch Mala.
"- Yes, that witch Mala."
You will have to.. - What?
I've to treat her to mango juice.
"- No, no, no."
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already fallen quite low.
How much further do you want me to make her fall down?
"No, no, I don't mean literally."
How do I explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
No.
"- Oh, God."
"He's a singer, sings in two voices."
Male and female.
- What?
Kitchen Kumar.. how are you?
Where did you get these new set of teeth from?
"Kundan, what a surprise."
- Mala.
Bhikhu.
Where did this duet come from?
I didn't know that Kundan is also going to be here.
"How are you, brother Kundan?"
Mala.
Kishen.
- Mona.
"I am no longer Mona, but Ma Jogeshwari."
You've named a railway station after you.
Since when?
How did you stay with Kitchen Kumar so long?
What can I do?
I thought about it several times.
But its not right to throw the master out of the house.
- What?
Who is he?
"Kundan, he's my son."
Bunty.
But he is very good looking.
Like father like son.
You?
Look handsome?
- I was joking.
You only appear to be.
And that's regretting as well.
"Just give him the freaking ""malk""."
[Josh]
You guys aren't even saying the same thing.
[Julian]
"We're all saying ""melk"", Josh!"
[Josh]
No!
"You're saying ""melk""!"
"You're saying ""malk""!"
(Yelling versions of milk)
[Josh]
Shut up!
Shut up!
[Donovan]
You better put it down.
[Julian]
"Don't do it, Josh!"
[Josh]
"You're going to shoot me, if I shoot myself?"
That doesn't even make any sense!
[Donovan and Julian]
"Josh, put it down!"
Put the gun down!
(Yelling at each other to put the gun down)
[Josh]
I'm going to kill myself over this!
[Julian]
You're like a brother to me!
Your head is like a brother to me!
(Screaming)
[Josh]
"And then, after that, we pull the trigger."
You only have to sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No?
How about you?
- Will you lend a caring hand... - Ah!
What?
I was wondering if I could just...
Hey!
I know you.
Hello.
You know me.
Cool!
"I mean... yeah, you do."
Do you?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
"I mean, I've seen you."
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing?
Hmmm... texting.
Very important or I would stop.
What are you doing?
"Actually, I'm out here volunteering for the Caring Hands homeless shelter."
Can you spare a minute?
Hum...
"Okay, go."
We're hoping to open a new location soon.
Expand our efforts.
"No, no!"
That family had drowned!
But one guy from that unlucky family had escaped!
Today he is standing in front of you as your death!
Then you will remember this knife too!
I used it to kill your father!
Where is shekhar?

And let love happen.
I found your love.
This is my fortunes.
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
Here we go.
I got to fix my finger.
NARRATOR:
It looks like Lee cut himself and he might be bleeding
Lee:
"Slow down, Lee."
Slow down.
You're going too fast.
You got plenty of time.
Broken in small bits.
"If it's big, it ain't going to get cooked."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" Yeah, if you got blood in the food then you, you can't serve that, you know."
Lee:
Still bleeding a little bit.
"Now you all, we are ready here."
This...
NARRATOR:
"Hold up, guys."
Hold up.
Lee.
Lee:
You got it.
NARRATOR:
"Looks like you cut yourself while you were cooking there, brother."
Lee:
Yes.
NARRATOR:
Let me see that.
Lee:
Right on top of the thumb.
NARRATOR:
We can't take a chance with blood being in this food and the Cub Scouts eating it.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
"Look at you, Peter."
Your grades have been steadily declining.
You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know.
I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
"Better do your research, Parker."
"Get it done, or I'm failing you."
Surprise!
"Well, say something."
Whas the occasion?
"Really, Peter."
Is your birthday!
Whether you want to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
"Don't you, Pete?"
"Hi, M.J. Hi."
"Hey, buddy."
Hey.
"Long time, no see."
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

No.
Her sponsors here saw the thing on the 'Net.
Let him!

He's got a mistress!
"And a kid, too!"
You let him do that?
Are you not going?
Fine.
I'll go myself.
I'll chop him to pieces.

"Moon, don't!"

You mean you had know it?
You approved him for the sale of thousand bucks?
"Moon, get on the car."
Where're you heading?
I've no idea.
"In that case, I'll just drop you alone the way."
I've to go to work.
What did you say?
"Did I hear ""work""?"
(Interrupts) Inconclusive!
Your results are inconclusive at best.
"No, you'll have plenty of time for measurements when you're down in the tunnel tonight."
Dr. Niven:
"Director, we have to stop the LHC until we assess the danger."
DG:
No Dr. Niven.
Once we have fixed this problem the LHC will run again as usual.

Finding the Higgs is the highest priority.
Amy:
Why is Dr. Niven going into the tunnels?
James:
Why do you think the Director General's here?
Matt:
Maybe they made a black hole...

Mmmhmm.
Amy: ...Yeah.
You too?
Amy:
"Wait, aren't you supposed to be on your way to Barcelona by now?"
Lisa:

Did the flashlight just die?
"Well, gentlemen, I think it's all over."
"I can't see anything, and he's behind me somewhere."

It's just a matter of time before he catches me.

You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.

He was so close to his brother and sister.

"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.
I'll buy lunch today.

"Saint-Jammes is a commune of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques ""département"" in the southwestern part of France."
Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port
"Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port is a commune of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques ""département"" in the southwestern part of France."
"Because of the ""multiplicative identity"", the first power of any number is the same number, and the zeroth power of any number is one (formula_56 and formula_57)."
Roots.
"Roots are the sixth arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and logarithms. The first term is called the ""index"", and the second term is called the ""radicand"". The result of a root is called a ""base"". When there is no index, this means it is a square (2) root."
The symbol for roots is the radical (formula_58).
Examples of roots:
formula_59
formula_60
formula_61
formula_62
formula_63
The first root of any number is the same number (formula_64).
Logarithms.
"Logarithms are the seventh arithmetic operation and one of the inverse operations of exponentiation and roots. The first term is called the ""base"", and the second term is called the ""power"". The result of a logarithm is called an ""exponent"". When there is no base, this means it is a base 10 logarithm."
The symbol for logarithm is logb(a)
Examples of logarithms:
formula_65
formula_66
formula_67
formula_68
formula_69
The logarithm of 1 (formula_70) is 0 in every base. This is because formula_71
"The logarithm base e, or natural logarithm, is written as formula_72."
Modulation.
"Modulation is the eighth arithmetic operation. It gives the remainder of a division. The first term is called the ""modulend"" and the second term is called the ""modulator"". The result of a modulation is called a ""modulus""."
The symbol for modulation is \
Examples of modulations:
formula_73\formula_74
formula_75\formula_76
formula_77\formula_78
formula_79\formula_80
formula_81\formula_82
"formula_77\formula_34 is always equal to zero, because zero can be divided by any number (formula_85)."
"Changing how addends are grouped in an addition does not change its sum either. This is called the ""associative property of addition""."
For example: formula_9
Additive inverses (opposites).
The opposite of a number formula_10 is formula_11. A number formula_10 plus its opposite formula_11 is always equal to 0: formula_14
"For example, the opposite of 5 is -5, because formula_15"
The absolute value of two opposite numbers is always the same.
Subtraction.
"Subtraction is the second arithmetic operation and the inverse operation of addition. The number that is being subtracted is the ""subtrahend"" and the number it is subtracted from is the ""minuend"". The result of a subtraction is called a ""difference""."
The symbol for subtraction is −
Examples of subtractions:
formula_16
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19
formula_20
formula_21
"Because of the ""additive identity"", any number minus zero is the same number (formula_22)."
"In a subtraction of two terms, switching the minuend and the subtrahend changes the sign of the answer, meaning subtraction is anticommutative."
For example: formula_23 and formula_24
Multiplication.
"Multiplication is the third arithmetic operation and the second hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of division. The terms in a multiplication are called ""factors"", and the result of a multiplication is called a ""product""."
Multiplication is repeated addition.
The symbol for multiplication is × (• in algebra)
Examples of multiplications:
formula_25
formula_26
formula_27
formula_28
formula_29
"Any number times one is the same number (formula_30). This is called the ""multiplicative identity""."
For example: formula_31
"Changing the order of the factors in a multiplication does not change its product. This is called the ""commutative property of multiplication""."
Style.
"The building is made of bricks and bush-hammered concrete, left exposed strongly influenced by the Rationalist Movement. It is in fact the parapets of the balconies that characterize the facades, through a skilful use of sandblasted bricks that draw geometries that are certainly functional, simple and precise, but not entirely alien to a certain taste for the reinterpretation of traditional elements such as ventilation grids, typical of Lombard farmhouses, to which many of Luigi Caccia Dominioni's contemporary linguistic choices for many Milanese condominiums also refer."
"Particular attention is paid to the construction detail, so much so that critics consider the condominium of Maffezzoli and Pellegrini an ""exercise of high design expertise and rare sensitivity""."
History.
• Design: 1957-1958
• Execution: 1958
• reference date: 1957 - 1958
Features.
"Palazzo Maffezzoli has a particular architectural, artistic, historical and cultural interest."

"So I listen to the radio,"
I like the pop music.

"Oh, the jeezer music."
Yeah.
"Right,"
"and I, I, I mean, I don't know how,  how old your mom is,"

uh-huh.
and they changed quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I,"
"this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago."
Uh-huh.
"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
"Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it's hard to follow.
"Right,"
"and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL."
"Oh, I've never seen that one."
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
"Okay,"
yeah.
"She,"
"I've seen a, uh, the previews for that."
It's very good.
"It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN."
"That's not what, uh,"
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
"Oh, we never miss that,"
or we try not to miss that.
"It's hysterical, isn't it?"
"Oh, we think it is, so funny."
Did you catch the Christmas?
"Oh, just part of it"
"I thought it was, you know,"
"and it had such a good story, too."
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Are, you're a real life Trekkie?"
I think so
I really like them.
"I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,"
but
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention"
"but,"
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"

Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Small island.
Yeah.
"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."
"Oh, okay."
"Yes,"
"because I have relatives who live in Houston,"
"so when would go, and we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,"
"yeah,"
like what your talking about.
"Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston this, this summer, even with all the oil spills and everything,"
"I mean, I was, oh, it was horrible."
Was it bad?
"I well never, ever go back."
"I don't think. Uh,"
"Oh, I hate to hear that."

Oh.
"Yeah,"
"see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California."

I mean incredibly large sharks.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night"

"so, just strung up,"
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the getties
"yeah,"
"just,"
"my family, uh, didn't like Texas,"
"and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up."
"T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in ."
That's nice.
"So I got an opportunity to transfer back,"
and I took it.
"God,"
that's great.
"Uh, I'm a native Texan."
Uh-huh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
"Yeah,"
"believe me,"
I know there is.
"I lived in Plano,"
and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.

Everybody else was an import.
"Well, I'm a West Texan."
Uh-huh.
"Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle."
Yes.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
"So, uh, Colorado's been fun."
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
"And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar."
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?"
"Uh, no,"
"they don't,"
"they,"
"the last one, well,"
"the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing,"
but it has since come down.
Okay.
Yeah.
"But, they are huge."
"If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring."
"No,"
"so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"well, there is lots of pretty country further west."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
"Okay,"
I'm back on.
Okay.
"Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?"
I watch evenings because I work all day.
I used to watch daytimes.
Uh-huh.
"Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing."
"Oh, so ..."
"And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,"
but now it's mainly evenings.
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
Yes.
Which ones?
"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
Oh.
Those are the two I like the best.
"Oh, two they're going to change."
"Well, one they're taking,   off."
I know.
"It's going to be history, I know."
I don't know what's going to
"yeah,"
we like L A LAW.
Uh-huh.
"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"
but that's kind of young for us.
My husband and I are grandparents.
"Oh, well. Well ..."
"So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,"
but we like L A LAW.
"We like, that."
"Uh, audiology."
Okay.
Fantastic. Uh
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.
Oh really?
"Uh, yeah."
Neat.
"But, uh, I don't know."
"It's, it's an interesting issue."
"There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few"
"and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot."
"I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures"
"but, uh,"
Yeah.
"I just,"
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California.
Uh-huh.
"So, I think it,"
the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what
"Oh, is that right?"
they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
Okay.
"Yeah,"
"I, I kind of,"
"yeah, I've heard things about that."
I've heard that they don't mess around very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows"
and I like the comedies
"and you know, and I, I do like good movies."
Uh-huh.
"I prescribed, subscribe to H B O."
Yeah
"well, we,"
So I can get some of the movies.
"Yeah,"
that's a good idea.
"We did have H B O,"
"but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know."
It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."
I mean
"Oh, yeah,"
"got the bumper sticker, too?"
"Oh, yes,"
"oh, yes."
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
"Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking."
"I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway."
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
"Uh, well, yeah,"
"for the last, uh, couple of months."
"Yeah,"
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.
"Well, like I said, good luck to you."
Thanks.
"All right,"
"well, um, take care,"
and maybe we'll meet up again some time.
All right.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
"My name is, uh, Donna Donahue,"
"and I live in Plano, Texas."
Hi.
"My name is Lowell,"
"and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, do you want to start"
or should I start?
Go right ahead.
"Okay, um,"
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in.
"We have, um, three children,"
"and, um, they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
"Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that."
Yeah.
"Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
"Uh, the,"
"I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler."
Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
And there's some Coke
"and you know, just help yourself to anything."
"So it was, it was, you know, the best,"
Wow.
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years.
Just once a week.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
Wow.
Wow.
Yeah.
"Now I never knew they were that, that big, huh,"
I won't have anything to do with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"Well, it was nice talking to you."
"Well, it certainly was, uh,"
"Maybe you can get,"
"how many,"
have you had very many of these calls?
"Uh, yeah,"
almost ever day.
How wonderful.
Yeah.
"Almost, almost ever single day from when they started it."
Yeah.
Maybe I'll just be so lucky.
"Okay,"
I enjoyed talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
"Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?"
"Yeah,"
"well, I, um,"
"about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house,"
"so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, uh, be working on my own lawn and garden,"
"and, uh, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden."
"I, I'd hate it, you know."
"but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,"
"and then I,"
"And your time,"
then you're that much farther ahead
Yeah.
"Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons."
It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.
Right.
I've seen them
"and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in"
"and,"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
That's neat.
"I went there,"
we have Home Depot out here.
I don't know if you've heard of it.
I went
and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.
Yes.
We have one.
I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
Huh.
"Oh, I'm, I'm sure."
"We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again."
A band saw?
What?
I did it through Adult Ed again.
Uh-huh.
"And the teacher was one of these negative people,"
"oh that's dangerous,"
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"
I like it a lot.
How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you grew up in Orlando."
Uh-huh.
"That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,"
"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon"
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
That's good.
Yeah.
"It was a late model,"
is that Chrysler van?
It's a eighty-seven.
"Yeah,"
one of the little mini vans?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Is a,"
Do you like the way it rides and stuff?
"Uh, rides or runs?"
Rides rough?
"It,"
"yeah,"
"well, yeah,"
"it rides, rides rough,"
it runs good.
Yeah.
"You know, I kind of,"
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
Yeah.
"You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway."
"Yeah,"
"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
Yeah.
"But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too."
"You driven American cars all,"
"Uh, yeah,"
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
Oh.
which my son goes hunting.
He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.
"Uh, he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to have them to go hunting with, you know."
"As far as  just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you should have handguns around."
"Right,"
right.
Right.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I agree too.
"I, uh,"
"it's, it's, as far as the ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban guns."
There's just too many.
"Well, no."
"There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these things."
"Right,"
"and I,"
"yeah,"
"right,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"And I mean the, the technology's not that hard."
"I mean, you could make a gun, you know, from simple, you know, you know."
"Yeah,"
"well I suppose you could. Uh,"
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed
and it's changed their perspective.
"And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer."
Uh-huh.
"So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,"
"Well, that's, that's great."
"I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing."
"Well that's,"
"Like I said, I think it does,"
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes
Yes.
Well
"Well, I guess, um,"
did you have anything else?
"No,"
no
I guess that's about all.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, I enjoyed talking with you."
"Well, good talking with you."
And I hope you have a good evening.
You too.
Thanks.
Okay.
"Bye,"
bye.
Bye
Okay.
"Do you, have you ever had to put your children in, child care, Mary Dell?"
Oh yes.
I'm an old experienced hand.
"and I say that's great, why not, you know."
"Oh, my,"
uh-huh.
"Yes,"
"why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,"
"I believe that, uh, we in that category,"
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
"but, we are seasoned minds."
"Oh, yeah,"
you're really ready to learn finally.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen."
"Yeah,"
"it was,"
It was a complete waste of money.
"Yeah,"
"settle down,"
"we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study"
"and, uh we know our limitations."
"Right,"
right.
"We,"
Right
"and, uh,"
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
"At seven,"
yeah.
"We're past, yeah, we're past that age"
Really.
"It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something."
"Oh, no"
"No,"
no.
"See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now"
and they go isn't that a nice van
"and I go, um."
"Not really, you know."
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
"I mean that, you know."
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
"yeah,"
"the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like"
"but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know."
"It's not like, like driving a little sports car."
Yeah.
"It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive."
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
"so, but I, I love mine,"
"so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii"
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"
sure.
"But he's in a box, right?"
"No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"in fact, it's funny."
"He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
he was just kind of walking around.
Didn't he used to?
Not really.
He was always in the box before.
Oh.
"Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's what I was thinking.
"Well, do you do any recycling?"
"Uh, we do here."
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?"
"We, they recycle,"
they have bins
Yeah.
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles"
and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
"Well, we, uh,"
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,"
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,"
"and that, that's true, uh, uh, you know,"
"the, the water was murky,"
and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
Huh-uh.
"huh-uh,"
no
I wouldn't want to eat them.
"No,"
"So,"
"no,"
no.

"The poem was written by young German poet and soldier Theodor Körner, who served in the Lützow Free Corps during the Wars of Liberation. It was set to music by Carl Maria von Weber and became very popular."
"The song praises the deeds of the Free Corps that became an essential part of Germany’s national identity in the 19th century due to its famous members. Besides Körner, “Turnvater” Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, the famous poet Joseph von Eichendorff, the inventor of the kindergarten Friedrich Fröbel, and Eleonore Prochaska, a woman who had dressed as a man in order to join the fight against the French, served in the Corps."
"The tune was adopted as the regimental march of the 1st Surrey Rifles, a Volunteer unit of the British Army."
"The 1927 German silent war film was directed by Richard Oswald and starring Ernst Rückert, Arthur Wellin and Mary Kid. The film’s art direction was by Ernst Stern.

Previously, the street included the Rue des Forges and reached the back of the Palais des Ducs. The name ""Coin du Miroir"" is linked to a hotel in the old Rue Saint-Jean at the corner of the streets Guillaume and Gondrans and which belonged to the Abbaye Notre-Dame du Miroir.

As an amateur player No was selected for the South Korea national baseball team and competed in the Baseball World Cup twice in 2009 and 2011."
"No was selected 21st overall by the NC Dinos in the 2012 KBO Draft. Although No batted a disappointing .194 with 2 home runs and 25 RBI in the 2012 Futures League, he became the Dinos' starting shortstop showing great defensive skills."

Félix Torres Amat or Félix Torres i Amat de Palou (6 August 1772 – 29 December 1849) was a Spanish Bishop. He translated the Sagrada Bible into vernacular Spanish and published a record of leading authors in Catalan.
"Torres Amat was born in Barcelona in 1772 the son of Joseph Torres and Teresa Amat. He studied languages before joining his uncle Felix Amat in Tarragona where he obtained a doctorate in Philosophy. He then taught philosophy, mathematics and theology becoming Canon of the Collegiate Church of San Ildefonso on 5 May 1806."
In 1824 he published a translation of the Bible in vernacular Spanish which had been entrusted to him by the Spanish kings Carlos IV and Fernando VII. This caused some criticism as both he and his father had become associated with Jansenism and he had to retire to a monastery for some time. On 1 May 1834 he was ordained as the Bishop of Astorga and in the following year he met William Harris Rule from Gibraltar as they both shared a common interest in distributing the bible in people's first languages. Torres Amat had had difficulty publishing his translation and he had relied on money from Anglicans in London.
"Torres Amat was elected to the prestigious Real Academia Española where he briefly held the ""T Seat"". Torres Amat's bible known as the Sagrada Bible was published with illustrations by Gustave Doré."
"Apart from the translation of the bible his best known work is ""Reports to help form a critical dictionary of Catalan writers and give some idea of the ancient and modern literature of Catalonia"" This was based on the work of his brother who had been a leading librarian in Barcelona and he had started to record notable Catalan authors."
Torres Amat died in Madrid on 29 December 1847.

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

In 1979 she took part in a writing course at the German Literature Institute in Leipzig. After publishing two collections of her own poetry and a collection of travel memoirs, her next publication was supposed to have been a collection of interviews with people in Havelland. Small excerpts appeared in 1983 and 1984 in literature magazines in the German Democratic Republic, but the publication of the entire text, which contained numerous passages critical of relations in the German Democratic Republic, was prevented by government censorship. The book ""So sehe ick die Sache"" was therefore published openly only in West Germany."
"In 1987, Eckart used a visit to the Frankfurter Buchmesse to relocate to the Federal Republic of Germany; she remained, however, a citizen of the German Democratic Republic. In 1988 she emigrated to the United States, where she continued her studies. In 1993 she earned her Master of Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota.

"= = = Leila; or, The Siege of Granada = = ="
"Leila; or, The Siege of Granada is a historical romance novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton published in 1838."
"The novel is set in Granada, Spain at the end of the Middle Ages — beginning in the summer of 1491. It was originally published in an expensive form, with many engraved illustrations. The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."
"In ""Leila"", as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila. The characters meet at the altar of a convent in which Leila is about to take her vows as a nun, and her father kills her. The domestic plot parallels the Christianization of Spain."

NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables:

"(b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery."
"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
"The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences. The plans will not only be demand driven, they will also be dynamic."

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"". The reason given for this change was that, although its range was very limited, this fish was quite common within that range and did not face any significant threats. A small number of fish were collected for the reef aquarium trade but the number was not believed to reduce the population to any great extent."

"This list includes mainly published philosophical and logical works of some note. Papers by Peirce in many fields were published and he wrote over 300 reviews for ""The Nation"". Sometimes an article below is shown after a special series, but was published during the series. Also note a complicating fact of Peirce scholarship, that Peirce sometimes made significant later corrections, modifications, and comments, for which one needs to consult such works as CP, W, EP, and the (online) "" Dictionary of Peirce's Terms""."

"They are small fish, up to in total length. Uniquely among killifish, ""Campellolebias"" and the closely related ""Cynopoecilus"" have internal fertilization. A part of the males' anal fin forms a ""pseudo-gonopodium"" that is used for inseminating the female."
There are currently four recognized species in this genus:
"The generic name ""Campellolebias"" is a combination of Campello, which honours the Brazilian chemical engineer, aquarist and amateur ichthyologist Gilberto Campello Brasil (1945-2008) and ""lebias"" a Greek word for a small fish which was applied to Killifish by Georges Cuvier and is now used a root for names within the order Cyprinodontiformes.

"In mathematics, the Golomb–Dickman constant arises in the theory of random permutations and in number theory. Its value is"
It is not known whether this constant is rational or irrational.
"Let ""a"" be the average — taken over all permutations of a set of size ""n"" — of the length of the longest cycle in each permutation. Then the Golomb–Dickman constant is"
"In the language of probability theory, formula_3 is asymptotically the expected length of the longest cycle in a uniformly distributed random permutation of a set of size ""n""."
"In number theory, the Golomb–Dickman constant appears in connection with the average size of the largest prime factor of an integer. More precisely,"
"where formula_5 is the largest prime factor of ""k"". So if ""k"" is a ""d"" digit integer, then formula_6 is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of ""k""."
The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way. What is the
"probability that second largest prime factor of ""n"" is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of ""n""? Asymptotically, this probability is formula_7."
"More precisely,"
"where formula_9 is the second largest prime factor ""n""."
"The Golomb-Dickman constant also arises when we consider the average length of the largest cycle of any function from a finite set to itself. If ""X"" is a finite set, if we repeatedly apply a function ""f"": ""X"" → ""X"" to any element ""x"" of this set, it eventually enters a cycle, meaning that for some ""k"" we have formula_10 for sufficiently large ""n""; the smallest ""k"" with this property is the length of the cycle. Let ""b"" be the average, taken over all functions from a set of size ""n"" to itself, of the length of the largest cycle. Then Purdom and Williams proved that"
There are several expressions for formula_7. These include:
"where formula_14 is the logarithmic integral,"
"where formula_16 is the exponential integral, and"
and
where formula_19 is the Dickman function.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (or simply IceCube) is a neutrino observatory constructed at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica.The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE10).
"Its thousands of sensors are located under the Antarctic ice, distributed over a cubic kilometre."
"Similar to its predecessor, the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), IceCube consists of spherical optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), each with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a single-board data acquisition computer which sends digital data to the counting house on the surface above the array. IceCube was completed on 18 December 2010."
"DOMs are deployed on strings of 60 modules each at depths between 1,450 and 2,450 meters into holes melted in the ice using a hot water drill. IceCube is designed to look for point sources of neutrinos in the TeV range to explore the highest-energy astrophysical processes."
In November 2013 it was announced that IceCube had detected 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside the Solar System.
"IceCube is part of a series of projects developed and supervised by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Collaboration and funding are provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Construction of IceCube was only possible during the Antarctic austral summer from November to February, when permanent sunlight allows for 24-hour drilling. Construction began in 2005, when the first IceCube string was deployed and sufficient data was collected to verify that the optical sensors functioned correctly. In the 2005–2006 season, an additional eight strings were deployed, making IceCube the largest neutrino telescope in the world."
Construction was completed on 17 December 2010. The total cost of the project was $279 million.
"Barco is not mentioned in the ""Inquirições"" (Inquiries) of 1288, although it is known to have existed at that time."
"The parish of Barco was established by the 15th century, when it was split off from the priory of St. Silvestre da Covilhã and given its own priest. Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint Simon the Zealot."
"Until the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco."
"Saint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw."
Between 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth.
"The census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings."
"By 1950 there were 1,800 people."
Since then the population has declined steadily.
In 2011 Barco had a population of just 473.
Until recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish.
"The Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco."
"Economic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction."
"Most people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye."
"Local gastronomical specialties include ""Borelhões"", sausages, river fish and wild boar."
"Religion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside."
"Festivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30)."
"Barco has always been part of Covilhã. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now ."
The boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894.
From 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco. It was then made a separate parish.
In 2013 Barco was again merged with the parish of Coutada to form the parish of União das Freguesias de Barco e Coutada.

"It shares its vertices and edges, as well as 20 of its triangular faces and all its pentagrammic faces, with the great dirhombicosidodecahedron, (although the latter has 60 edges not contained in the great snub dodecicosidodecahedron). It shares its other 60 triangular faces (and its pentagrammic faces again) with the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron."
"The edges and triangular faces also occur in the compound of twenty octahedra. In addition, 20 of the triangular faces occur in one enantiomer of the compound of twenty tetrahemihexahedra, and the other 60 triangular faces occur in the other enantiomer."
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in). In addition, overlapping regions of coplanar faces can cancel each other out. The difference between the fillings of this polyhedron is very slight, but still present."

"The great pentagonal hexecontahedron (or great petaloid ditriacontahedron) is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron and dual to the uniform ""great snub icosidodecahedron"". It has 60 intersecting irregular pentagonal faces, 120 edges, and 92 vertices."
leads to the perturbation of both the linear dispersion relation of photons and constant dispersion of charge waves by the avoided crossing between the two dispersion lines of polaritons.
Similarly to the acoustic and the optical phonons and far from the resonance one branch is photon-like while the other charge wave-like.
Mathematically the Hopfield dielectric for the one mode of excitation is equivalent to the Trojan wave packet in the harmonic
approximation. The Hopfield model of the dielectric predicts the existence of eternal trapped frozen photons similar to
the Hawking radiation inside the matter with
the density proportional to the strength of the matter-field coupling.
The Hamiltonian of the quantized Lorentz dielectric consisting of formula_1 harmonic oscillators interacting with the
quantum electromagnetic field can be written in the dipole approximation as:
and defining projections of oscillator charge waves onto the electromagnetic field
polarization directions
after dropping the longitudinal contributions not interacting with the electromagnetic field one may obtain the Hopfield Hamiltonian
Because the interaction is not
mixing polarizations this can be transformed to the normal form with the eigen-frequencies of two polaritonic branches:
with the eigenvalue equation

"The Lanyang Museum (LYM; ) is a museum about the local area in Toucheng Township, Yilan County, Taiwan."
"In 1989, local Yilan personnel proposed the establishment of Kailan Museum. In December 1992, Yilan County Government established the Museum Preparatory and Planning Committee and the official name of the museum was chosen to be Lanyang Museum. The museum location was chosen to be near Wushi Harbor area in Toucheng Township. In September 1994, the Yilan County Government appointed National Museum of Natural Science and Building and Planning Research Foundation of National Taiwan University to form the planning team to implement Lanyang Museum Overall Development and Planning Research which was completed in 1995. In March 1999, the Lanyang Museum Preparatory Office was established. Artech architecture was awarded the design and construction for the museum in April 2000."
"In October 2001, the Museum section of Cultural Affairs Bureau of Yilan County Government handed over 1,924 artifacts to the museum, followed by Wangye Boat, Bozai Boat and tri-wheeler in a ceremony held at the lobby of Cultural Affairs Bureau building of the county government in January 2003."
The museum groundbreaking ceremony was held on 31 July 2014 at Wushi Harbor and construction began on 2 August 2004 and it began its first stage of opening on 18 May 2010 where only group visits made by advance reservations were accepted. The museum was finally opened officially to public on 16 October 2010.
The museum building was designed by a team led by Kris Yao those design was inspired by the cuestas commonly seen along Beiguan Coast. The museum adopts the geometric shapes of the cuestas where the roof protrudes from the ground at an angle of 20 degrees meeting a wall which rises from the ground at an angle of 70 degrees. Thus the building emerges from the ground in a similar fashion to those cuestas.
"The museum features exhibits showcasing the topography of Yilan, including the mountains, the plains, and the sea."
The museum is accessible within walking distance northeast from Toucheng Station of Taiwan Railways.

"While the history of colonization and marginalization is not unique to the Americas, the practice of deriving sports team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples of North America is a significant phenomenon in the United States and Canada. The popularity of the American Indian in global culture has led to a number of teams in Europe also adopting team names derived from Native Americans. In Asia, Africa, Australia and South America, the adoption of indigenous names generally indicates that the team members are themselves indigenous. While there are team names in North America derived from other ethnic groups, such as the Boston Celtics, the New York Yankees, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Minnesota Vikings, these are names selected by immigrant/settler groups to represent themselves."
"The rise of indigenous rights movements has led to controversy regarding the continuation of practices rooted in colonialism. Such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. Such practices are seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities, which have the a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that creates a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against ""hostile and abusive"" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students."
"The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington."
"Little League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting ""the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature."" This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians."
