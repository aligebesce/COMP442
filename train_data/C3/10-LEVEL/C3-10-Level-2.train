Picked three jacks up hoping there'd be a joker.
Oh you awkward sod.

A hypochondriac?

What made her say that I wonder.
And she would like me to go to the well women's clinic  every Wednesday  it's run.
"And she would like me to go, book in for an appointment."
And she would discuss my diet amongst other things.
Oh dear.
Mhm.

What time?
Eight thirty.
Eight thirty.
"And this is, this is about the leaflet is it?"
Yeah.
Yes.
Get all the information.
Decide on how we do the  thing.
And erm do take it
To go into details of that it's probably much more sensible to do it with just two or three people.
But er  at least if we can  pull the information together that evening that'd be a start.
Form a sub committee!
Ooh!
sub committee with everybody present!
Well you can always divide up.
Thanks ever so much folks and I'll see you

Do you remember when we got it?
Yes.
Pantomime
"It got, we caught it."
We caught it.
"Yes, it was really good."
And these  so you can catch eggs.
We need to waggle it.
That's better than ca catching the eggs is better than catching the Wagon Wheel.
I wondered whether it had.

Mm mm.
granules.
You'd never believe that would you?

Chicken variety.

Well.
I wanted to bottom that one because I think it's a fairly easy one to do.
"Then, then go on to Jim's point of, come on lads."
What do you mean
by a project engineer?
Mm.
So that's okay.
"And that's the, so let's put that to one side and let's, let's"
debate
Yeah.
We'll start that with questioning
Jim's point.
my office.
Mm.

"So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger."
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.

It is a responsibility.
Where would you find the conditions of carriage.
On the back of every erm  contract out there.
On the back of every contract.

"Oh, great!"

It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Just look at that poor little boy , Amy , '' said the taller of the two ."
"`` He is almost frozen , I believe ."
Why does n't Caroline hurry and open the door ? ''
"`` There she goes now , '' said Amy ."
"`` Edie , could n't we coax her to let him come in and get warm ?"
He looks so cold . ''
"And she drew her sister out into the hall , where the housekeeper was taking Bertie 's parcels ."
"`` Caroline , '' whispered Edith timidly , `` please tell that poor little fellow to come in and get warm -- he looks very cold . ''"
"`` He 's used to the cold , I warrant you , '' said the housekeeper rather impatiently ."
`` It wo n't hurt him . ''
"`` But it is Christmas week , '' said Edith gravely , `` and you know , Caroline , when Mamma was here she used to say that we ought to be particularly thoughtful of others who were not so happy or well-off as we were at this time . ''"
"Perhaps Edith 's reference to her mother softened Caroline , for she turned to Bertie and said cordially enough , `` Come in , and warm yourself before you go ."
It 's a cold day . ''
Bertie shyly followed her to the kitchen .
"`` Sit up to the fire , '' said Caroline , placing a chair for him , while Edith and Amy came round to the other side of the stove and watched him with friendly interest ."
`` What 's your name ? ''
asked Caroline .
"`` Robert Ross , ma'am . ''"
"`` Oh , you 're Mrs. Ross 's nephew then , '' said Caroline , breaking eggs into her cake-bowl , and whisking them deftly round ."
`` And you 're Sampson 's errand boy just now ?
"My goodness , '' as the boy spread his blue hands over the fire , `` where are your mittens , child ?"
You 're never out without mittens a day like this ! ''
"`` I lent them to William John -- he had n't any , '' faltered Bertie ."
He did not know but that the lady might consider it a grave crime to be mittenless .
`` No mittens ! ''
exclaimed Amy in dismay .
"`` Why , I have three pairs ."
And who is William John ? ''
"`` He is my cousin , '' said Bertie ."
`` And he 's awful sickly .
"He wanted to go out to play , and he had n't any mittens , so I lent him mine ."
I did n't miss them -- much . ''
And then one night came the tragedy .
"It was the spring of the year , and the story had been told for the night , and Jane was now asleep in her bed ."
"Wendy was sitting on the floor , very close to the fire , so as to see to darn , for there was no other light in the nursery ; and while she sat darning she heard a crow ."
"Then the window blew open as of old , and Peter dropped in on the floor ."
"He was exactly the same as ever , and Wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth ."
"He was a little boy , and she was grown up ."
"She huddled by the fire not daring to move , helpless and guilty , a big woman ."
"`` Hullo , Wendy , '' he said , not noticing any difference , for he was thinking chiefly of himself ; and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first ."
"`` Hullo , Peter , '' she replied faintly , squeezing herself as small as possible ."
"Something inside her was crying `` Woman , Woman , let go of me . ''"
"`` Hullo , where is John ? ''"
"he asked , suddenly missing the third bed ."
"`` John is not here now , '' she gasped ."
`` Is Michael asleep ? ''
"he asked , with a careless glance at Jane ."
"`` Yes , '' she answered ; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as well as to Peter ."
"`` That is not Michael , '' she said quickly , lest a judgment should fall on her ."
Peter looked .
"`` Hullo , is it a new one ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
`` Boy or girl ? ''
`` Girl . ''
Now surely he would understand ; but not a bit of it .
"`` Peter , '' she said , faltering , `` are you expecting me to fly away with you ? ''"
`` Of course ; that is why I have come . ''
"He added a little sternly , `` Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time ? ''"
She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass .
"`` I ca n't come , '' she said apologetically , `` I have forgotten how to fly . ''"
`` I 'll soon teach you again . ''
"`` O Peter , do n't waste the fairy dust on me . ''"
She had risen ; and now at last a fear assailed him .
`` What is it ? ''
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
He looked real careworn and worried today . ''
The Rexton gossip soon ceased with the cessation of the young minister 's visits to Four Winds .
"A month later it suffered a brief revival when a tall grim-faced old woman , whom a few recognized as Captain Anthony 's housekeeper , was seen to walk down the Rexton road and enter the manse ."
"She did not stay there long -- watchers from a dozen different windows were agreed upon that -- and nobody , not even Mrs. Danby , who did her best to find out , ever knew why she had called ."
"Emily looked at Alan with grim reproach when she was shown into his study , and as soon as they were alone she began with her usual abruptness , `` Mr. Douglas , why have you given up coming to Four Winds ? ''"
Alan flinched .
"`` You must ask Lynde that , Miss Oliver , '' he said quietly ."
`` I have asked her -- and she says nothing . ''
`` Then I can not tell you . ''
Anger glowed in Emily 's eyes .
"`` I thought you were a gentleman , '' she said bitterly ."
`` You are not .
You are breaking Lynde 's heart .
She 's gone to a shadow of herself and she 's fretting night and day .
"You went there and made her like you -- oh , I 've eyes -- and then you left her . ''"
Alan bent over his desk and looked the old woman in the face unflinchingly .
"`` You are mistaken , Miss Oliver , '' he said earnestly ."
`` I love Lynde and would be only too happy if it were possible that I could marry her .
I am not to blame for what has come about -- she will tell you that herself if you ask her . ''
His look and tone convinced Emily .
`` Who is to blame then ?
Lynde herself ? ''
"`` No , no . ''"
`` The Captain then ? ''
`` Not in the sense you mean .
I can tell you nothing more . ''
A baffled expression crossed the old woman 's face .
`` There 's a mystery here -- there always has been -- and I 'm shut out of it .
Lynde wo n't confide in me -- in me who 'd give my life 's blood to help her .
Perhaps I can help her -- I could tell you something .
Have you stopped coming to Four Winds -- has she made you stop coming -- because she 's got such a wicked old scamp for a father ?
Is that the reason ? ''
Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time .
"Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne 's neck , snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder ."
"`` Anne , do n't you like me a little bit , even if I ai n't a good boy like Paul ? ''"
"`` Indeed I do , '' said Anne sincerely ."
"Somehow , it was impossible to help liking Davy ."
`` But I 'd like you better still if you were n't so naughty . ''
"`` I ... did something else today , '' went on Davy in a muffled voice ."
`` I 'm sorry now but I 'm awful scared to tell you .
"You wo n't be very cross , will you ?"
"And you wo n't tell Marilla , will you ? ''"
"`` I do n't know , Davy ."
Perhaps I ought to tell her .
"But I think I can promise you I wo n't if you promise me that you will never do it again , whatever it is . ''"
"`` No , I never will ."
"Anyhow , it 's not likely I 'd find any more of them this year ."
I found this one on the cellar steps . ''
"`` Davy , what is it you 've done ? ''"
`` I put a toad in Marilla 's bed .
You can go and take it out if you like .
"But say , Anne , would n't it be fun to leave it there ? ''"
`` Davy Keith ! ''
Anne sprang from Davy 's clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla 's room .
The bed was slightly rumpled .
"She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad , blinking at her from under a pillow ."
`` How can I carry that awful thing out ? ''
moaned Anne with a shudder .
The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry .
"Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs , for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall ."
When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief .
`` If Marilla knew she 'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her life .
I 'm so glad that little sinner repented in time .
There 's Diana signaling to me from her window .
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
But here Dr. Livesey cut in .
"`` Stay a bit , '' said he , `` stay a bit ."
No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling .
"The captain has said too much or he has said too little , and I 'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words ."
"You do n't , you say , like this cruise ."
"Now , why ? ''"
"`` I was engaged , sir , on what we call sealed orders , to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me , '' said the captain ."
`` So far so good .
But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do .
"I do n't call that fair , now , do you ? ''"
"`` No , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` I do n't . ''"
"`` Next , '' said the captain , `` I learn we are going after treasure -- hear it from my own hands , mind you ."
"Now , treasure is ticklish work ; I do n't like treasure voyages on any account , and I do n't like them , above all , when they are secret and when -LRB- begging your pardon , Mr. Trelawney -RRB- the secret has been told to the parrot . ''"
`` Silver 's parrot ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` It 's a way of speaking , '' said the captain ."
"`` Blabbed , I mean ."
"It 's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about , but I 'll tell you my way of it -- life or death , and a close run . ''"
"`` That is all clear , and , I dare say , true enough , '' replied Dr. Livesey ."
"`` We take the risk , but we are not so ignorant as you believe us ."
"Next , you say you do n't like the crew ."
Are they not good seamen ? ''
"`` I do n't like them , sir , '' returned Captain Smollett ."
"`` And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands , if you go to that . ''"
"`` Perhaps you should , '' replied the doctor ."
"`` My friend should , perhaps , have taken you along with him ; but the slight , if there be one , was unintentional ."
And you do n't like Mr. Arrow ? ''
"`` I do n't , sir ."
"I believe he 's a good seaman , but he 's too free with the crew to be a good officer ."
A mate should keep himself to himself -- should n't drink with the men before the mast ! ''
`` Do you mean he drinks ? ''
cried the squire .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"`` Well , I must run up to MacPhersons ' ."
Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen 's today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me . ''
`` And I must get Marilla 's tea .
She went to see Mrs. Keith this evening and she will soon be back . ''
"Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home ; the fire was crackling cheerily , a vase of frost-bleached ferns and ruby-red maple leaves adorned the table , and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air ."
But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh .
`` Are your eyes troubling you ?
Does your head ache ? ''
queried Anne anxiously .
`` No .
I 'm only tired ... and worried .
It 's about Mary and those children ... Mary is worse ... she ca n't last much longer .
"And as for the twins , I do n't know what is to become of them . ''"
`` Has n't their uncle been heard from ? ''
"`` Yes , Mary had a letter from him ."
"He 's working in a lumber camp and ` shacking it , ' whatever that means ."
"Anyway , he says he ca n't possibly take the children till the spring ."
He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to ; but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter .
She says she ca n't bear to ask any of them .
Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that 's a fact .
"And the long and short of it is , Anne , that I 'm sure Mary wants me to take those children ... she did n't say so but she LOOKED it . ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"Anne clasped her hands , all athrill with excitement ."
"`` And of course you will , Marilla , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` I have n't made up my mind , '' said Marilla rather tartly ."
"`` I do n't rush into things in your headlong way , Anne ."
Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim .
"And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after ... twins , at that . ''"
Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children .
"`` Twins are very interesting ... at least one pair of them , '' said Anne ."
`` It 's only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous .
And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I 'm away in school . ''
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
"cried John , but soon he found he had not ."
"Not one of them could fly an inch , though even Michael was in words of two syllables , and Peter did not know A from Z. Of course Peter had been trifling with them , for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him ."
"Fortunately , as we have mentioned , one of his hands was messy with it , and he blew some on each of them , with the most superb results ."
"` Now just wriggle your shoulders this way , ' he said , ` and let go . '"
"They were all on their beds , and gallant Michael let go first ."
"He did not quite mean to let go , but he did it , and immediately he was borne across the room . '"
I flewed ! '
he screamed while still in mid-air .
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom .
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Oh , ripping ! '"
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
` Look at me ! '
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter , they could not help kicking a little , but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling , and there is almost nothing so delicious as that ."
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first , but had to desist , Tink was so indignant ."
"Up and down they went , and round and round ."
Heavenly was Wendy 's word . '
"I say , ' cried John , ` why should n't we all go out ! '"
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them .
Michael was ready : he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles .
But Wendy hesitated .
` Mermaids ! '
said Peter again .
` Oo ! '
` And there are pirates . '
"` Pirates , ' cried John , seizing his Sunday hat , ` let us go at once . '"
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27 .
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window ; and , yes , it was still shut , but the room was ablaze with light , and most heart-gripping sight of all , they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round , not on the floor but in the air ."
"Not three figures , four !"
In a tremble they opened the street door .
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs , but Mrs. Darling signed to him to go softly ."
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
"`` I want none of your money , '' said I , `` but what you owe my father ."
"I 'll get you one glass , and no more . ''"
"When I brought it to him , he seized it greedily and drank it out ."
"`` Aye , aye , '' said he , `` that 's some better , sure enough ."
"And now , matey , did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth ? ''"
"`` A week at least , '' said I. `` Thunder ! ''"
he cried .
`` A week !
I ca n't do that ; they 'd have the black spot on me by then .
"The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment ; lubbers as could n't keep what they got , and want to nail what is another 's ."
"Is that seamanly behaviour , now , I want to know ?"
But I 'm a saving soul .
"I never wasted good money of mine , nor lost it neither ; and I 'll trick 'em again ."
I 'm not afraid on 'em .
"I 'll shake out another reef , matey , and daddle 'em again . ''"
"As he was thus speaking , he had risen from bed with great difficulty , holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out , and moving his legs like so much dead weight ."
"His words , spirited as they were in meaning , contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered ."
He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge .
"`` That doctor 's done me , '' he murmured ."
`` My ears is singing .
Lay me back . ''
"Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place , where he lay for a while silent ."
"`` Jim , '' he said at length , `` you saw that seafaring man today ? ''"
`` Black Dog ? ''
I asked .
`` Ah !
"Black Dog , '' says he ."
`` HE 'S a bad un ; but there 's worse that put him on .
"Now , if I ca n't get away nohow , and they tip me the black spot , mind you , it 's my old sea-chest they 're after ; you get on a horse -- you can , ca n't you ?"
"Well , then , you get on a horse , and go to -- well , yes , I will !"
"-- to that eternal doctor swab , and tell him to pipe all hands -- magistrates and sich -- and he 'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow -- all old Flint 's crew , man and boy , all on 'em that 's left ."
"I was first mate , I was , old Flint 's first mate , and I 'm the on ' y one as knows the place ."
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
I am the daughter of a criminal and I am no fit wife for Alan Douglas .
"No , Alan , do n't plead , please ."
I wo n't think differently -- I never can . ''
There was a ring of finality in her tone that struck dismay to Alan 's heart .
"He prepared to entreat and argue , but before he could utter a word , the boughs behind them parted and Captain Anthony stepped down from the bank ."
"`` I 've been listening , '' he announced coolly , `` and I think it high time I took a share in the conversation ."
"You seem to have run up against a snag , Mr. Douglas ."
You say Frank Harmon is dead .
That 's good riddance if it 's true .
Is it true ? ''
`` His brother declares it is . ''
"`` Well , then , I 'll help you all I can ."
"I like you , Mr. Douglas , and I happen to be fond of Lynde , too -- though you may n't believe it ."
I 'm fond of her for her mother 's sake and I 'd like to see her happy .
I did n't want to give her to Harmon that time three years ago but I could n't help myself .
"He had the upper hand , curse him ."
"It was n't for my own sake , though -- it was for my wife 's ."
"However , that 's all over and done with and I 'll do the best I can to atone for it ."
"So you wo n't marry your minister because your father was not a good man , Lynde ?"
"Well , I do n't suppose he was a very good man -- a man who makes his wife 's life a hell , even in a refined way , is n't exactly a saint , to my way of thinking ."
"But that 's the worst that could be said of him and it does n't entail any indelible disgrace on his family , I suppose ."
"I am not your father , Lynde . ''"
`` Not my father ? ''
Lynde echoed the words blankly .
`` No .
Your father was your mother 's first husband .
She never told you of him .
"When I said he made her life a hell , I said the truth , no more , no less ."
"I had loved your mother ever since I was a boy , Lynde ."
But she was far above me in station and I never dreamed it was possible to win her love .
She married James Ashley .
"He was a gentleman , so called -- and he did n't kick or beat her ."
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
Rich !
I says .
"And I 'll tell you what : I 'll make a man of you , Jim ."
"Ah , Jim , you 'll bless your stars , you will , you was the first that found me ! ''"
"And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face , and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes ."
"`` Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? ''"
he asked .
At this I had a happy inspiration .
"I began to believe that I had found an ally , and I answered him at once ."
"`` It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me -- there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . ''"
`` Not a man -- with one -- leg ? ''
he gasped .
`` Silver ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ah , Silver ! ''"
says he .
`` That were his name . ''
"`` He 's the cook , and the ringleader too . ''"
"He was still holding me by the wrist , and at that he give it quite a wring ."
"`` If you was sent by Long John , '' he said , `` I 'm as good as pork , and I know it ."
"But where was you , do you suppose ? ''"
"I had made my mind up in a moment , and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves ."
"He heard me with the keenest interest , and when I had done he patted me on the head ."
"`` You 're a good lad , Jim , '' he said ; `` and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ?"
"Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn -- Ben Gunn 's the man to do it ."
"Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help -- him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? ''"
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men .
"`` Aye , but you see , '' returned Ben Gunn , `` I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim ."
"What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? ''"
"`` I am sure he would , '' said I. `` As it was , all hands were to share . ''"
`` AND a passage home ? ''
he added with a look of great shrewdness .
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
"If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England ."
"If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones ."
You ca n't find the treasure .
You ca n't sail the ship -- there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship .
"You ca n't fight us -- Gray , there , got away from five of you ."
"Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find ."
"I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you ."
"Tramp , my lad ."
"Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . ''"
Silver 's face was a picture ; his eyes started in his head with wrath .
He shook the fire out of his pipe .
`` Give me a hand up ! ''
he cried .
"`` Not I , '' returned the captain ."
`` Who 'll give me a hand up ? ''
he roared .
Not a man among us moved .
"Growling the foulest imprecations , he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch ."
Then he spat into the spring .
`` There ! ''
he cried .
`` That 's what I think of ye .
"Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon ."
"Laugh , by thunder , laugh !"
"Before an hour 's out , ye 'll laugh upon the other side ."
Them that die 'll be the lucky ones . ''
"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off , ploughed down the sand , was helped across the stockade , after four or five failures , by the man with the flag of truce , and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees ."
"21 The Attack AS soon as Silver disappeared , the captain , who had been closely watching him , turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray ."
It was the first time we had ever seen him angry .
`` Quarters ! ''
he roared .
"And then , as we all slunk back to our places , `` Gray , '' he said , `` I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman ."
`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
"At first Edith 's letters had been full of Ned , but in her last two or three she had said little about him ."
Katherine wrote and jokingly asked Edith if she and Ned had quarreled .
"Edith wrote back and said , `` What nonsense . ''"
"She and Ned were as good friends as ever , but he was getting acquainted in Riverton now and was n't so dependent on her society , etc. ."
Katherine sighed and went on a fern hunt with Professor Keith .
It was getting near the end of her vacation and she had only two weeks more .
They were sitting down to rest on the side of the road when she mentioned this fact inconsequently .
The professor prodded the harmless dust with his cane .
"Well , he supposed she would find a return to work pleasant and would doubtless be glad to see her Riverton friends again ."
"`` I 'm dying to see Edith , '' said Katherine ."
`` And Ned ? ''
suggested Professor Keith .
`` Oh yes .
"Ned , of course , '' assented Katherine without enthusiasm ."
There did n't seem to be anything more to say .
"One can not talk everlastingly about ferns , so they got up and went home ."
Katherine wrote a particularly affectionate letter to Ned that night .
Then she went to bed and cried .
"When Professor Keith came up to bid Miss Rangely good-bye on the eve of her departure from Harbour Hill , he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy ."
But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects .
"After all , it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye ."
"She was in the middle of some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short , and her voice trailed off in a babyish quiver ."
The professor put out his arm and drew her close to him .
"His hat dropped under their feet and was trampled on , but I doubt if Professor Keith knows the difference to this day , for he was fully absorbed in kissing Katherine 's hair ."
"When she became cognizant of this fact , she drew herself away ."
"`` Oh , Sidney , do n't !"
-- think of Edith !
I feel like a traitor . ''
`` Do you think she would care very much if I -- if you -- if we -- '' hesitated the professor .
"`` Oh , it would break her heart , '' cried Katherine with convincing earnestness ."
`` I know it would -- and Ned 's too .
They must never know . ''
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
Joanna !
"Nay , by the sacred rood !"
where is she ?
"Host , where is that girl ? ''"
"`` Girl , Sir Daniel ? ''"
cried the landlord .
"`` Nay , sir , I saw no girl . ''"
"`` Boy , then , dotard ! ''"
cried the knight .
`` Could ye not see it was a wench ?
"She in the murrey-coloured mantle -- she that broke her fast with water , rogue -- where is she ? ''"
"`` Nay , the saints bless us !"
"Master John , ye called him , '' said the host ."
"`` Well , I thought none evil ."
He is gone .
I saw him -- her -- I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; ' a was saddling a grey horse . ''
"`` Now , by the rood ! ''"
"cried Sir Daniel , `` the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . ''"
"`` Sir knight , '' observed the messenger , with bitterness , `` while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` Selden , fall me out with six cross-bowmen ; hunt me her down ."
"I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House ."
Be it upon your head .
"And now , sir messenger , we march . ''"
"And the troop broke into a good trot , and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley , with the staring villagers ."
CHAPTER II -- IN THE FEN It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way .
The sky was all blue ; the jolly wind blew loud and steady ; the windmill-sails were spinning ; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn .
"He had been all night in the saddle , but his heart was good and his body sound , and he rode right merrily ."
"The path went down and down into the marsh , till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him , and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before ."
"On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows , pools of water shaking in the wind , and treacherous bogs , as green as emerald , to tempt and to betray the traveller ."
The path lay almost straight through the morass .
"It was already very ancient ; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery ; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk , and every here and there , for a few hundred yards , it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen ."
"`` Good shrew , let laugh , I pray you ."
"An ye could see yourself , I warrant ye would laugh the first . ''"
"`` Well , '' cried the lad , flushing , `` ye shall answer this when ye answer for the other ."
Laugh while yet ye may ! ''
"`` Nay , now , good cousin , '' replied Sir Daniel , with some earnestness , `` think not that I mock at you , except in mirth , as between kinsfolk and singular friends ."
"I will make you a marriage of a thousand pounds , go to !"
and cherish you exceedingly .
"I took you , indeed , roughly , as the time demanded ; but from henceforth I shall ungrudgingly maintain and cheerfully serve you ."
"Ye shall be Mrs. Shelton -- Lady Shelton , by my troth !"
for the lad promiseth bravely .
Tut !
ye will not shy for honest laughter ; it purgeth melancholy .
"They are no rogues who laugh , good cousin ."
"Good mine host , lay me a meal now for my cousin , Master John ."
"Sit ye down , sweetheart , and eat . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Master John , `` I will break no bread ."
"Since ye force me to this sin , I will fast for my soul 's interest ."
"But , good mine host , I pray you of courtesy give me a cup of fair water ; I shall be much beholden to your courtesy indeed . ''"
"`` Ye shall have a dispensation , go to ! ''"
cried the knight .
"`` Shalt be well shriven , by my faith !"
"Content you , then , and eat . ''"
"But the lad was obstinate , drank a cup of water , and , once more wrapping himself closely in his mantle , sat in a far corner , brooding ."
"In an hour or two , there rose a stir in the village of sentries challenging and the clatter of arms and horses ; and then a troop drew up by the inn door , and Richard Shelton , splashed with mud , presented himself upon the threshold ."
"`` Save you , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` How !
Dickie Shelton ! ''
cried the knight ; and at the mention of Dick 's name the other lad looked curiously across .
`` What maketh Bennet Hatch ? ''
"`` Please you , sir knight , to take cognisance of this packet from Sir Oliver , wherein are all things fully stated , '' answered Richard , presenting the priest 's letter ."
"`` And please you farther , ye were best make all speed to Risingham ; for on the way hither we encountered one riding furiously with letters , and by his report , my Lord of Risingham was sore bested , and lacked exceedingly your presence . ''"
`` How say you ?
A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts -- they shall all taste arrows -- no man of them shall struggle through this wood .
"For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed -- all oppressed !"
"Who , then , hath done this evil ?"
"Sir Daniel , by the rood !"
Shall he then profit ?
shall he sit snug in our houses ?
shall he till our fields ?
shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ?
I trow not .
"He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain -- I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . ''"
Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale .
"He raised it , as if to pledge the speaker ."
"`` Master Ellis , '' he said , `` y ' are for vengeance -- well it becometh you !"
"-- but your poor brother o ' the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing ."
He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . ''
"`` Lawless , '' replied the other , `` to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest ."
"We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle ."
"Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us -- all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid -- we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him ."
'T is a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . ''
"`` Ay , '' returned Lawless , `` I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis ."
And meanwhile what do we ?
"We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . ''"
"`` Y ' are untrue , Will Lawless ."
"Ye still smell of the Grey Friars ' buttery ; greed is your undoing , '' answered Ellis ."
`` We took twenty pounds from Appleyard .
We took seven marks from the messenger last night .
A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . ''
"`` And to-day , '' said one of the men , `` I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood ."
Here is his purse . ''
Ellis counted the contents .
`` Five score shillings ! ''
he grumbled .
On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King .
She turned and walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its inhabitants .
"If Alan had troubled himself to look , he would have seen a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes ."
But the only eyes which had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver .
"* * * * * During Alan 's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde , either in the house or out of it ."
This surprised and worried him .
"There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony , who continued to be suave and friendly ."
"Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the Captain , who was witty , incisive , and pungent ; yet he disliked the man himself more at every visit ."
"If he had been compelled to define his impression , he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel ."
But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something .
"Sometimes he caught her glance , full of perplexity and -- it almost seemed -- distrust ."
She looked as if she felt hostile towards him .
But Alan dismissed the idea as absurd .
She had been friendly from the first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval .
Lynde 's mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem .
"She had not gone away , for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her , he responded indifferently that she was out walking ."
Alan caught a glint of amusement in the older man 's eyes as he spoke .
He could have sworn it was malicious amusement .
One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore .
"As he turned the headland of the cove , he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet away ."
The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared among the firs .
Alan was thunderstruck .
There was no room for doubt that she meant to avoid him .
He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings which he did not even then understand .
He only realized that he felt bitterly hurt and grieved -- puzzled as well .
What did it all mean ?
He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and stopped her resolutely .
"`` Miss Oliver , '' he said bluntly , `` is Miss Lynde angry with me ?"
And why ? ''
Emily looked at him piercingly .
`` Have you no idea why ? ''
she asked shortly .
"`` A mother is the best thing in the world -- I realized that when I lost mine , '' said Alan gently ."
`` How long is it since your mother died ? ''
`` Three years .
"Oh , I thought I should die too when she did ."
"She was very ill -- she was never strong , you know -- but I never thought she could die ."
There was a year then -- part of the time I did n't believe in God at all and the rest I hated Him .
I was very wicked but I was so unhappy .
Father had so many dreadful moods and -- there was something else .
I used to wish to die . ''
She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground .
"Alan , leaning against a pine tree , looked down at her ."
The sunlight fell through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood brown .
"All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time and she seemed like a helpless , weary child ."
He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her .
"`` You must resemble your mother , '' he said absently , as if thinking aloud ."
`` You do n't look at all like your father . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , I do n't look like Mother either ."
She was tiny and dark -- she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair .
"Oh , I remember her look so well ."
I wish I did resemble her .
I loved her so -- I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble .
"At least , she died in peace . ''"
There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl 's voice as she spoke the last sentence .
Again Alan felt the unpleasant impression that there was much in her that he did not understand -- might never understand -- although such understanding was necessary to perfect friendship .
"She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him before , yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in jealous repression ."
"It must be something connected with her father , Alan thought ."
"Doubtless , Captain Anthony 's past would not bear inspection , and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her knowledge ."
His heart filled with aching pity for her ; he raged secretly because he was so powerless to help her .
"Her girlhood had been blighted , robbed of its meed of happiness and joy ."
Was she likewise to miss her womanhood ?
Alan 's hands clenched involuntarily at the unuttered question .
This was seeing ; it was not hearing .
He means foully .
"Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! ''"
Such was the case .
The bell rang no longer .
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I like not that ."
"Nay , '' he cried again , `` I like that little ."
What may this betoken ?
"Let us go , by the mass ! ''"
"`` He hath gone east , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . ''"
"`` Jack , y ' are too cowardly , '' replied Dick ."
"`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''"
"They were afoot at once , passed the stream upon some stepping-stones , and began to mount on the other side , which was steeper , towards the margin of the wood ."
"The ground became very uneven , full of knolls and hollows ; trees grew scattered or in clumps ; it became difficult to choose a path , and the lads somewhat wandered ."
"They were weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertions and the lack of food , and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand ."
"Presently , coming to the top of a knoll , they were aware of the leper , some hundred feet in front of them , crossing the line of their march by a hollow ."
"His bell was silent , his staff no longer tapped the ground , and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees ."
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket .
"The lads , at the first glimpse , had crouched behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck ."
"`` Certain , he pursueth us , '' said Dick -- `` certain !"
"He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?"
that it should not sound .
"Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''"
`` What maketh he ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
"Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ?"
"Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?"
"Dick , there is below this something deeper . ''"
"`` Nay , I care not , '' moaned Dick ; `` the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water ."
The saints be mine assistance ! ''
But Ginger 's feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship .
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold .
`` Why do you call him Ginger ? ''
"asked Anne , who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage ."
`` My brother the sailor named him .
Maybe it had some reference to his temper .
I think a lot of that bird though ... you 'd be surprised if you knew how much .
He has his faults of course .
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another .
Some people object to his swearing habits but he ca n't be broken of them .
I 've tried ... other people have tried .
Some folks have prejudices against parrots .
"Silly , ai n't it ?"
I like them myself .
Ginger 's a lot of company to me .
"Nothing would induce me to give that bird up ... nothing in the world , miss . ''"
Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up .
"Anne , however , was beginning to like the queer , fussy , fidgety little man , and before the meal was over they were quite good friends ."
Mr. Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it .
`` That 's right .
Go ahead .
There 's lots of room for improvement in this settlement ... and in the people too . ''
"`` Oh , I do n't know , '' flashed Anne ."
"To herself , or to her particular cronies , she might admit that there were some small imperfections , easily removable , in Avonlea and its inhabitants ."
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing .
"`` I think Avonlea is a lovely place ; and the people in it are very nice , too . ''"
"`` I guess you 've got a spice of temper , '' commented Mr. Harrison , surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him ."
"`` It goes with hair like yours , I reckon ."
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I would n't have located here ; but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults ? ''
"`` I like it all the better for them , '' said loyal Anne ."
`` I do n't like places or people either that have n't any faults .
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting .
"When morning came and it was the moon's turn to sink out of sight in the west, the Owls went to bed in their hollow trees, and Crows, Blue Jays, Woodpeckers, Chickadees, Grouse, Quail, Squirrels, and Rabbits came out."
"The Goldfinches were there too, but you would never have known the husbands and fathers of the flock, unless you had seen them before in their winter clothing, which is like that worn by the wives and children. Here, too, were the winter visitors, the Snow Buntings and the Juncos, brimming over with happiness and news of their northern homes."
"This warm day made them think of the coming springtime, and they were already planning their flight."
"""I wish you would stay with us all summer,"" said a friendly Goldfinch, as he dirted the snow off from a tall brown weed and began to pick out and eat the seeds."
"""Stay all summer!"" exclaimed a jolly little Snow Bunting. ""Why should we want to stay? Perhaps if you would promise to keep the snow and ice we might."""
"""Why not ask the Goldfinches to come north with us?"" suggested a Junco."
"""That would be much more sensible, for they can stand the cold weather as well as we, but we cannot stand warm days, such as I hear they have in this part of the country after the ice melts."""
"Then the older people of the group began to talk of the cares of life and many other things which did not interest their children, so the younger ones wandered away from them."
"""I say,"" called a young Junco to a young Snow Bunting, ""wouldn't you like to show some of these playmates of ours the countries where we were born?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" answered the Snow Bunting. ""Wouldn't they open their eyes, though? I'd like to have them see the rocks up there."""
"""And the animals,"" said the Junco."
"""Yes! Wouldn't they stare at the Bears, though!"""
"""Humph,"" said a Blue Jay. ""I wouldn't care very much about seeing Bears, would you?"" And he turned to a Crow near by."
"""No,"" said the Crow. ""I don't think very much of Bears anyway."" He said this as though he had seen them all his life, but the Chickadees say that he never saw even a Cub."
"""They haven't any big animals here,"" said the Junco to the Snow Bunting."
"""Haven't we, though?"" replied the Blue Jay. ""Guess you wouldn't say that if you saw the Ground Hog. Would he say that?"" he asked, turning to the young Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits who stood around listening."
"""No indeed!"" they answered, for they wanted their visitors to understand that the Forest was a most wonderful place, and they really thought the Ground Hog very large."
"""I don't believe he is as big as a Bear"" said the Snow Bunting, with his bill in the air."
"""How big is he?"" asked the Junco."
"Now the Blue Jay was afraid that the birds from the north were getting the better of him, and he felt very sure that they would leave before the Ground Hog had finished his winter sleep, so he did what no honest bird would have even thought of doing. He held his crested head very high and said, ""He is bigger than that rock, a great deal bigger."""
"The Crow looked at the rock and gave a hoarse chuckle, for it was a hundred times larger than the Ground Hog. The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits looked at each other without saying a word. They knew how the Blue Jay had lied, and it made them ashamed. The Grouse pretended to fix their snow-shoes."
They did not want to look at the birds from the north.
"The Snow Buntings and Juncos felt that it would not do to talk about Bears to people who had such a great creature as the Ground Hog living among them. ""He must be wonderful,"" they said. ""Where does he sleep?"""
"""In the Bats' cave,"" answered the Blue Jay, who having told one lie, now had to tell another to cover it up. ""He sleeps in the middle and there is just room left around the edges for the Bats."""
"Now at this very time the Ground Hog was awake in his burrow. He could feel that it was warmer and he wanted room to stretch. He thought it would seem good to have an early spring after such a cold winter, so he decided to take a walk and make the weather, as his grandfather had done. When he came out of his burrow he heard a great chattering and went to see what was the matter. That was how it happened that soon after the Blue Jay had told about the Bats' cave, one wide-awake young Junco saw a reddish-brown animal trotting over the grass toward them."
"""Who is that?"" he cried."
"The Grouse, Quail, Woodpeckers, Goldfinches, Chickadees, Squirrels, and Rabbits gave one look. ""Oh, there is the Ground Hog!"" they cried. Then they remembered and were ashamed again because of what the Blue Jay had said."
"""Oh!"" said the Snow Buntings and the Juncos. ""So that is the Ground Hog!"
"Big as that rock, is he? And you don't think much of Bears?"""
"The Crow pointed one claw at the Blue Jay. ""I never said he was as big as that rock. He is the fellow that said it."""
"""I don't care,"" said the Blue Jay; ""I was only fooling. I meant to tell you after a while. It's a good joke on you."" But he had a sneaky look around the bill as he spoke, and nobody believed him. Before long, he and the Crow were glad enough to get away from the rest and go away together. Yet even then they were not happy, for each began to blame the other, and they had a most dreadful fight."
"When the Ground Hog was told about it he said, ""What foolishness it is to want to tell the biggest story! My grandfather told us once that a lie was always a lie, and that calling it a joke didn't make it any better. I think he was right."""
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms."
"That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long."
"And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him."
"Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there."
"He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron."
Spring Time
"""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!"""
The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.
"""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy."
"He's REAL!"""
"When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy himself had said it."
"That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"""
That was a wonderful Summer!
"Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him."
"They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether."
Summer Days
"They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched."
"""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked."
"""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork."
"""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs."
"""I don't believe you can!"" he said."
"""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so."
"""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit."
"That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice."
"""I don't want to!"" he said again."
But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.
"""He hasn't got any hind legs!"" he called out. ""Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh."
"""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!"""
"""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild rabbit."
"And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy."
"""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"""
"But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did."
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"Jane said so, but George said, ""Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."""
"The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of tall lilies."
"And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring."
"""It's bears,"" said Jane. ""I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."""
"The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur dresses, and the white silence was quite gone."
"""Bears, indeed,"" cried a shrill voice. ""You'll wish we were bears before you've done with us."""
"This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference between ""lawn"" and ""grass"" did not seem so great as it had at Forest Hill."
"Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen anyone cry before."
"""Don't cry for real,"" whispered George, ""or you'll get chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl it frightens them."""
"So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You try it."
"Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane, George said: ""Yah who's afraid? We are George and Jane who are you?"""
"""We are the sealskin dwarfs,"" said the brown people, twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in kaleidoscopes. ""We are very precious and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very best sealskin."""
"""And what are those fires for?"" bellowed George for Jane was crying louder and louder."
"""Those,"" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, ""are the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now so he sleeps curled up around the Pole but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go and eat everybody in the world except us."""
"""WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT FOR?"" yelled George."
"""Oh just for spite,"" bawled the dwarfs carelessly as if they were saying, ""Just for fun."""
"Jane stopped crying to say: ""You are heartless."""
"""No, we aren't,"" they said. ""Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses """
"And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin."
"""Thank you so much for telling us,"" said George. ""Good evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"""
"But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence better."
"Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: ""What's that on your head?"""
And George felt it was all up for he knew it was his father's sealskin cap.
"The dwarf did not wait for an answer. ""It's made of one of us,"" he screamed, ""or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"""
"Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed."
"The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole."
"You have no idea how cold it was the kind of cold that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of."
"The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close and said: ""Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."""
"The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and colder."
"""We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one comfort,"" said George. ""We shall be turned into ice long before that."""
"""Of corse he will,"" said the hairy boy to the right of Whomsoever J."
"Opper, who afterwards became the father of a lad who grew up to be editor of the Persiflage column of the Atlantic Monthly."
Thus the boys of America impressed General Gage with their courage and patriotism and grew up to be good men.
"An expedition to Canada was fitted out the same winter, and an attack made on Quebec, in which General Montgomery was killed and Benedict Arnold showed that he was a brave soldier, no matter how the historian may have hopped on him afterwards."
"The Americans should not have tried to take Canada. Canada was, as Henry Clay once said, a persimmon a trifle too high for the American pole, and it is the belief of the historian, whose tears have often wet the pages of this record, that in the future Canada will be what America is now, a free country with a national debt of her own, a flag of her own, an executive of her own, and a regular annual crisis of her own, like other nations."
"In 1776 Boston was evacuated. Washington, in order to ascertain whether Lord Howe had a call to fish, cut bait, or go ashore, began to fortify Dorchester Heights, March 17, and on the following morning he was not a little surprised to note the change. As the weather was raw, and he had been in-doors a good deal during the winter, Lord Howe felt the cold very keenly. He went to the window and looked at the Americans, but he would come back chilly and ill-tempered to the fire each time. Finally he hitched up and went away to Halifax, where he had acquaintances."
"On June 28 an attack was made by the English on Fort Moultrie. It was built of palmetto logs, which are said to be the best thing in the world to shoot into if one wishes to recover the balls and use them again."
"Palmetto logs accept and retain balls for many years, and are therefore good for forts."
"When the fleet got close enough to the fort so that the brave Charlestonians could see the expression on the admiral's face, they turned loose with everything they had, grape, canister, solid shot, chain-shot, bar-shot, stove-lids, muffin-irons, newspaper cuts, etc., etc., so that the decks were swept of every living thing except the admiral."
"General Clinton by land tried to draw the attention of the rear gunners of the fort, but he was a poor draughtsman, and so retired, and both the land and naval forces quit Charleston and went to New York, where board was not so high."
July 4 was deemed a good time to write a Declaration of Independence and have it read in the grove.
"Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved that ""the United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and Independent states."" John Adams, of Massachusetts, seconded the resolution. This was passed July 2, and the report of the committee appointed to draw up a Declaration of Independence was adopted July 4."
"The Declaration was dictated by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the most melodious English of any American of his time."
"Jefferson had a vocabulary next to Noah Webster, with all the dramatic power of Dan. He composed the piece one evening after his other work. We give a facsimile of the opening lines."
"Philadelphia was a scene of great excitement. The streets were thronged, and people sat down on the nice clean door-steps with perfect recklessness, although the steps had just been cleaned with ammonia and wiped off with a chamois-skin. It was a day long to be remembered, and one that made George III. wish that he had reconsidered his birth."
"In the steeple of the old State-House was a bell which had fortunately upon it the line ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It was rung by the old man in charge, though he had lacked faith up to that moment in Congress. He believed that Congress would not pass the resolution and adopt the Declaration till after election."
"Thus was the era of good feeling inaugurated both North and South. There was no North then, no South, no East, no West; just one common country, with Washington acting as father of same. Oh, how nice it must have been!"
Washington was one of the sweetest men in the United States. He gave his hand in marriage to a widow woman who had two children and a dark red farm in Virginia.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
"The British army now numbered thirty thousand troops, while Washington's entire command was not over seven thousand strong. The Howes, one a general and the other an admiral, now turned their attention to New York. Washington, however, was on the ground beforehand."
"Howe's idea was to first capture Brooklyn, so that he could have a place in which to sleep at nights while engaged in taking New York."
"The battle was brief. Howe attacked the little army in front, while General Clinton got around by a circuitous route to the rear of the Colonial troops and cut them off. The Americans lost one thousand men by death or capture. The prisoners were confined in the old sugar-house on Liberty Street, where they suffered the most miserable and indescribable deaths."
"The army of the Americans fortunately escaped by Fulton Ferry in a fog, otherwise it would have been obliterated. Washington now fortified Harlem Heights, and later withdrew to White Plains. Afterwards he retired to a fortified camp called North Castle."
"Howe feared to attack him there, and so sent the Hessians, who captured Fort Washington, November 16."
"It looked scaly for the Americans, as Motley says, and Philadelphia bade fair to join New York and other cities held by the British. The English van could be seen from the Colonial rear column. The American troops were almost barefooted, and left their blood-stained tracks on the frozen road."
"It was at this time that Washington crossed the Delaware and thereby found himself on the other side; while Howe decided to remain, as the river was freezing, and when the ice got strong enough, cross over and kill the Americans at his leisure. Had he followed the Colonial army, it is quite sure now that the English would have conquered, and the author would have been the Duke of Sandy Bottom, instead of a plain American citizen, unknown, unhonored, and unsung."
"The following spring Washington was sent under General Fry to drive out the French, who had started farming at Pittsburg. Fry died, and Washington took command. He liked it very much. After that Washington took command whenever he could, and soon rose to be a great man."
"The first expedition against Fort Duquesne (pronounced du-kane) was commanded by General Braddock, whose portrait we are able to give, showing him at the time he did not take Washington's advice in the Duquesne matter. Later we show him as he appeared after he had abandoned his original plans and immediately after not taking Washington's advice."
"""The Indians,"" said Braddock, ""may frighten Colonial troops, but they can make no impression on the king's regulars. We are alike impervious to fun or fear."""
"Braddock thought of fighting the Indians by man[oe]uvring in large bodies, but the first body to be man[oe]uvred was that of General Braddock, who perished in about a minute."
"We give the reader, above, an idea of Braddock's soldierly bearing after he had been man[oe]uvring a few times."
"It was then that Washington took command, as was his custom, and began to fight the Indians and French as one would hunt varmints in Virginia."
"Braddock's men fired by platoons into the trees and tore a few holes in the State line, but when most of the Colonial troops were dead the regulars presented their tournures to the foe and fled as far as Philadelphia, where they each took a bath and had some laundry-work done."
General Forbes took command of the second expedition. He spent most of his time building roads.
"Time passed on, and Forbes built viaducts, conduits, culverts, and rustic bridges, till it was November, and they were yet fifty miles from the fort. He then decided to abandon the expedition, on account of the cold, and also fearing that he had not made all of his bridges wide enough so that he could take the captured fort home with him."
"Washington, however, though only an aidy kong of General Forbes, decided to take command. His mother had said to him over and over, ""George, in an emergency always take command."" He done so, as General Rusk would say. As he approached, the French set fire to the fort, and retreated, together with the Indians and Molly Maguires."
"Pittsburg now stands on this historic ground, and is one of the most delightful cities of America."
Many other changes were going on at this time. The English got possession of Acadia and the French forts at the head of the Bay of Fundy.
"In 1757 General Loudon collected an army for an attack on Louisburg. He drilled his troops all summer, and then gave up the attack because he learned that the French had one more skiff than he had."
The Loudons of America at the time of this writing are more quiet and sensible regarding their ancestry than any of the doodle-bug aristocracy of our promoted peasantry and the crested Yahoos of our cowboy republic.
The Loudons or Lowdowns of America had a very large family. Some of them changed their names and moved.
"The next year after the fox pass of General Loudon, Amherst and Wolfe took possession of the entire island."
"About the time of Braddock's justly celebrated expedition another started out for Crown Point. The French, under Dieskau (pronounced dees-kow), met the army composed of Colonial troops in plain clothes, together with the regular troops led by officers with drawn swords and overdrawn salaries. The regular general, seeing that the battle was lost, excused himself and retired to his tent, owing to an ingrowing nail which had annoyed him all day. Lyman, the Colonial officer now took command, and wrung victory from the reluctant jaws of defeat. For this Johnson, the English general, received twenty-five thousand dollars and a baronetcy, while Lyman received a plated butter-dish and a bass-wood what-not. But Lyman was a married man, and had learned to take things as they came."
"Four months prior to the capture of Duquesne, one thousand boats loaded with soldiers, each with a neat little lunch-basket and a little flag to wave when they hurrahed for the good kind man at the head of the picnic, viz., General Abercrombie, sailed down Lake George to get a whiff of fresh air and take Ticonderoga."
"When they arrived, General Abercrombie took out a small book regarding tactics which he had bought on the boat, and, after refreshing his memory, ordered an assault. He then went back to see how his rear was, and, finding it all right, he went back still farther, to see if no one had been left behind."
Abercrombie never forgot or overlooked any one. He wanted all of his pleasure-party to be where they could see the fight.
In that way he missed it himself. I would hate to miss a fight that way.
The Abercrombies of America mostly trace their ancestry back by a cut-off avoiding the general's line.
"Niagara had an expedition sent against it at the time of Braddock's trip. The commander was General Shirley, but he ran out of money while at the Falls and decided to return. This post did not finally surrender till 1759."
"This gave the then West to the English. They had tried for one hundred and forty years to civilize it, but, alas, with only moderate success."
"Prosperous and happy even while sniping in their fox-hunting or canvas-back-duck clothes, these people feel somewhat soothed for their lack of culture because they are well-to-do."
"In 1759 General Wolfe anchored off Quebec with his fleet and sent a boy up town to ask if there were any letters for him at the post-office, also asking at what time it would be convenient to evacuate the place."
"The reply came back from General Montcalm, an able French general, that there was no mail for the general, but if Wolfe was dissatisfied with the report he might run up personally and look over the W's."
"Wolfe did so, taking his troops up by an unknown cow-path on the off side of the mountain during the night, and at daylight stood in battle-array on the Plains of Abraham. An attack was made by Montcalm as soon as he got over his wonder and surprise. At the third fire Wolfe was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard some one exclaim,"
"""They run! They run!"""
"Things were very much unsettled. England had not sent a minister to this country, and had arranged no commercial treaty with us."
Washington's Cabinet consisted of three portfolios and a rack in which he kept his flute-music.
"The three ministers were the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Treasury. There was no Attorney-General, or Postmaster-General, or Secretary of the Interior, or of the Navy, or Seed Catalogue Secretary."
"Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, advised that Congress at the earliest moment provide itself with a national debt, which was done, the war debt being assumed by the Congressional representatives of the thirteen Colonies."
"A tax was levied on spirits, and a mint started, combining the two, and making the mint encourage the consumption of spirits, and thus the increase of the tax, very likely."
"A Whiskey Rebellion broke out in 1794. Pennsylvania especially rebelled at the tax on this grocery, but it was put down. (Those wishing to know which was put down will find out by consulting the Appendix, which will be issued a year from this winter.)"
"A few Indian wars now kept the people interested, and a large number of the red brothers, under Little Turtle, soon found themselves in the soup, as Washington put it so tersely in his message the following year."
Twenty-five thousand square miles north of the Ohio were obtained by treaty from the Indians.
"England claimed that traffic with America was not desirable, as the Americans did not pay their debts. Possibly that was true, for muskrat pelts were low at that time, and England refused to take cord-wood and saw-logs piled on the New York landing as cash."
"Chief-Justice Jay was sent to London to confer with the king, which he did. He was not invited, however, to come to the house during his stay, and the queen did not call on Mrs. Jay. The Jays have never recovered from this snub, and are still gently guyed by the comic papers."
"But the treaty was negotiated, and now the Americans are said to pay their debts as well as the nobility who marry our American girls instead of going into bankruptcy, as some would do."
"The Mississippi and the Mediterranean Sea were opened for navigation to American vessels now, and things looked better, for we could by this means exchange our cranberries for sugar and barter our Indian relics for camel's-hair shawls, of which the pioneers were very much in need during the rigorous winters in the North."
"The French now had a difficulty with England, and Washington, who still remembered La Fayette and the generous aid of the French, wished that he was back at Mount Vernon, working out his poll-tax on the Virginia roads, for he was in a tight place."
"It was now thought best to have two political parties, in order to enliven editorial thought and expression. So the Republican party, headed by Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, and the Federalist party, led by Hamilton and Adams, were organized, and public speakers were engaged from a distance."
"The latter party supported the administration, which was not so much of a job as it has been several times since."
"Washington declined to accept a third term, and wrote a first-rate farewell address. A lady, whose name is withheld, writing of those times, closes by saying that President Washington was one of the sweetest men she ever knew."
"John Adams succeeded Washington as President, and did not change his politics to amount to much."
"He made a good record as Congressman, but lost it as President largely because of his egotism. He seemed to think that if he neglected to oil the gearing of the solar system about so often, it would stop running."
We should learn from this to be humble even when we are in authority.
"Adams and Jefferson were good friends during the Revolution, but afterwards political differences estranged them till they returned to private life. Adams was a poor judge of men, and offended several members of the press who called on him to get his message in advance."
"Our country was on the eve of a war with France, when Napoleon I. was made Consul, and peace followed."
"Adams's administration made the Federalists unpopular, owing to the Alien and Sedition laws, and Jefferson was elected the successor of Adams, Burr running as Vice-President with him. The election was so close that it went to the House, however."
"Jefferson, or the Sage of Monticello, was a good President, noted for his simplicity. He married and brought his bride home to Monticello prior to this. She had to come on horseback about one hundred miles, and, as the house was unfinished and no servants there, they had to sleep on the work-bench and eat what was left of the carpenter's lunch."
"Jeffersonian simplicity was his strong point, and people who called at the White House often found him sprinkling the floor of his office, or trying to start a fire with kerosene."
"Burr was Vice-President, and, noticing at once that the office did not attract any attention to speak of, decided to challenge Mr. Alexander Hamilton to fight a duel with him."
"The affair took place at Weehawken, July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell at the first fire, on the same spot where his eldest son had been killed in the same way."
"The artist has shown us how Burr and Hamilton should have fought, but, alas! they were not progressive men and did not realize this till too late. Another method would have been to use the bloodless method of the French duel, or the newspaper customs adopted by the pugilists of 1893."
The time is approaching when mortal combat in America will be confined to belligerent people under the influence of liquor. A newspaper assault instead of a duel might have made Burr President and Hamilton Vice-President.
"Burr went West, and was afterwards accused of treason on the ground that he was trying to organize Mexico against the United States government."
"""Who run?"" inquired Wolfe."
"""The French! The French!"" came the reply."
"""Now God be praised,"" said Wolfe, ""I die happy."""
"Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. ""They run!"
"They run!"" he heard some one say."
"""Who run?"" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of cognac."
"""We do,"" replied the man."
"""Then so much the better,"" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, ""for I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."""
This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian has to control himself in order to avoid lying.
"The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in the history of our country, and should be remembered by every school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the other."
"Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag floated."
What an empire!
What a game-preserve!
"Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the poor."
"Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief."
"The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way, and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is deserving of more than a passing notice."
"The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur."
"These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able also to survey a county or rule a nation."
CHAPTER XII.
PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.
It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history will more fully appear.
"The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a glue-factory on the side of the river."
"A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to be held in the future the work will be on sale."
The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.
"George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates, playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then, in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer."
"We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid about trying it."
"When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips in their pockets."
It is the only historical question regarding America not fully settled by this book.
"Nothing more was heard of him till he turned up in a thinking part in ""Rip Van Winkle."""
"Many claims regarding the discovery of various parts of the United States had been previously made. The Cabots had discovered Labrador, the Spaniards the southern part of the United States; the Norsemen had discovered Minneapolis, and Columbus had discovered San Salvador and gone home to meet a ninety-day note due in Palos for the use of the Pinta, which he had hired by the hour."
But we are speaking of the discovery of New York.
"About this time a solitary horseman might have been seen at West 209th Street, clothed in a little brief authority, and looking out to the west as he petulantly spoke in the Tammany dialect, then in the language of the blank-verse Indian. He began, ""Another day of anxiety has passed, and yet we have not been discovered! The Great Spirit tells me in the thunder of the surf and the roaring cataract of the Harlem that within a week we will be discovered for the first time."""
"As he stands there aboard of his horse, one sees that he is a chief in every respect and in life's great drama would naturally occupy the middle of the stage. It was at this moment that Hudson slipped down the river from Albany past Fort Lee, and, dropping a nickel in the slot at 125th Street, weighed his anchor at that place. As soon as he had landed and discovered the city, he was approached by the chief, who said, ""We gates. I am one of the committee to show you our little town. I suppose you have a power of attorney, of course, for discovering us?"""
"""Yes,"" said Hudson. ""As Columbus used to say when he discovered San Salvador, 'I do it by the right vested in me by my sovereigns.' 'That oversizes my pile by a sovereign and a half,' says one of the natives; and so, if you have not heard it, there is a good thing for one of your dinner-speeches here."""
"""Very good,"" said the chief, as they jogged down-town on a swift Sixth Avenue elevated train towards the wigwams on 14th Street, and going at the rate of four miles an hour. ""We do not care especially who discovers us, so long as we hold control of the city organization. How about that, Hank?"""
"""That will be satisfactory,"" said Mr. Hudson, taking a package of imported cheese and eating it, so that they could have the car to themselves."
"""We will take the departments, such as Police, Street-Cleaning, etc., etc., etc., while you and Columbus get your pictures on the currency and have your graves mussed up on anniversaries. We get the two-moment horses and the country châteaux on the Bronx. Sabe?"""
"""That is, you do not care whose portrait is on the currency,"" said Hudson, ""so you get the currency."""
"Said the man, ""That is the sense of the meeting."""
"Thus was New York discovered via Albany and Fort Lee, and five minutes after the two touched glasses, the brim of the schoppin and the Manhattan cocktail tinkled together, and New York was inaugurated."
"Obtaining a gentle and philanthropical gentleman who knew too well the city by gas-light, they saw the town so thoroughly that nearly every building in the morning wore a bright red sign which read"
+           +
|   BEWARE OF PAINT.   |
+           +
"Regarding the question as to who has the right to claim the priority of discovery of New York, I unite with one of the ablest historians now living in stating that I do not know."
"Here and there throughout the work of all great historians who are frank and honest, chapter after chapter of information like this will burst forth upon the eye of the surprised and delighted reader."
"Society at the time of the discovery of the blank-verse Indian of America was crude. Hudson's arrival, of course, among older citizens soon called out those who desired his acquaintance, but he noticed that club life was not what it has since become, especially Indian club life."
He found a nation whose regular job was war and whose religion was the ever-present prayer that they might eat the heart of their enemy plain.
"The Indian High School and Young Ladies' Seminary captured by Columbus, as shown in the pictures of his arrival at home and his presentation to the royal pair one hundred and seventeen years before this, it is said, brought a royal flush to the face of King Ferdie, who had been well brought up."
"This can be readily understood when we remember that the Indian wore at court a court plaster, a parlor-lamp-shade in stormy weather, made of lawn grass, or a surcingle of front teeth."
"They were shown also in all these paintings as graceful and beautiful in figure; but in those days when the Pocahontas girls went barefooted till the age of eighty-nine years, chewed tobacco, kept Lent all winter and then ate a brace of middle-aged men for Easter, the figure must have been affected by this irregularity of meals."
"Unless the Pocahontas of the present day has fallen off sadly in her carriage and beauty, to be saved from death by her, as Smith was, and feel that she therefore had a claim on him, must have given one nervous prostration, paresis, and insomnia."
"The Indian and the white race never really united or amalgamated outside of Canada. The Indian has always held aloof from us, and even as late as Sitting Bull's time that noted cavalry officer said to the author that the white people who simply came over in the Mayflower could not marry into his family on that ground. He wanted to know why they had to come over in the Mayflower."
"""We were here,"" said the aged warrior, as he stole a bacon-rind which I used for lubricating my saw, and ate it thoughtfully, ""we were here and helped Adam 'round up' and brand his animals. We are an old family, and never did manual labor. We are just as poor and proud and indolent as those who are of noble blood. We know we are of noble blood because we have to take sarsaparilla all the time. We claim to come by direct descent from Job, of whom the inspired writer says,"
"""Old Job he was a fine young lad,       Sing Glory hallelujah."
"On the third day, at one P.M., Lee opened with one hundred and fifty guns on Cemetery Ridge. The air was a hornet's nest of screaming shells with fiery tails. As it lulled a little, out of the woods came eighteen thousand men in battle-array extending over a mile in length. The Yankees knew a good thing when they saw it, and they paused to admire this beautiful gathering of foemen in whose veins there flowed the same blood as in their own, and whose ancestors had stood shoulder to shoulder with their own in a hundred battles for freedom."
"Their sentiment gave place to shouts of battle, and into the silent phalanx a hundred guns poured their red-hot messages of death. The golden grain was drenched with the blood of men no less brave because they were not victorious, and the rich fields of Pennsylvania drank with thirsty eagerness the warm blood of many a Southern son."
"Yet they moved onward. Volley after volley of musketry mowed them down, and the puny reaper in the neglected grain gave place to the grim reaper Death, all down that unwavering line of gray and brown."
"They marched up to the Union breastworks, bayoneted the gunners at their work, planted their flags on the parapets, and, while the Federals converged from every point to this, exploding powder burned the faces of these contending hosts, who, hand to hand, fought each other to death, while far-away widows and orphans multiplied to mourn through the coming years over this ghastly folly of civil war."
"Whole companies of the Confederates rushed as prisoners into the arms of their enemies, and the shattered remnant of the battered foe retreated from the field."
"While all this was going on in Pennsylvania, Pemberton was arranging terms of surrender at Vicksburg, and from this date onward the Confederacy began to wobble in its orbit, and the President of this ill-advised but bitterly punished scheme began to wish that he had been in Canada when the war broke out."
"In April of the same year Admiral Dupont, an able seaman with massive whiskers, decided to run the fortifications at Charleston with iron-clads, but the Charleston people thought they could run them themselves. So they drove him back after the sinking of the Kennebec and the serious injury of all the other vessels."
"General Gillmore then landed with troops. Fort Wagner was captured. The 54th Regiment of colored troops, the finest organized in the Free States, took a prominent part and fought with great coolness and bravery. By December there were fifty thousand colored troops enlisted, and before the war closed over two hundred thousand."
It is needless to say that this made the Yankee unpopular at the time in the best society of the South.
"General Gillmore attempted to capture Sumter, and did reduce it to a pulp, but when he went to gather it he was met by a garrison still concealed in the basement, and peppered with volleys of hot shingle-nails and other bric-à-brac, which forced him to retire with loss."
He said afterward that Fort Sumter was not desirable anyhow.
"This closed the most memorable year of the war, with the price of living at the South running up to eight hundred and nine hundred dollars per day, and currency depreciating so rapidly that one's salary had to be advanced every morning in order to keep pace with the price of mule-steaks."
CHAPTER XXVIII.
LAST YEAR OF THE DISAGREEABLE WAR.
"General Grant was now in command of all the Union troops, and in 1864-5 the plan of operation was to prevent the junction of the Confederates, General Grant seeking to interest the army in Virginia under General Lee, and General Sherman the army of General Joseph E."
Johnston in Georgia.
"Sherman started at once, and came upon Johnston located on almost impregnable hills all the way to Atlanta. The battles of Dalton, Resaca, Dallas, Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw Mountain preceded Johnston's retreat to the intrenchments of Atlanta, July 10, Sherman having been on the move since early in May, 1864."
"Jefferson Davis, disgusted with Johnston, placed Hood in command, who made three heroic attacks upon the Union troops, but was repulsed."
"Sherman now gathered fifteen days' rations from the neighbors, and, throwing his forces across Hood's line of supplies, compelled him to evacuate the city."
"The historian says that Sherman was entirely supplied from Nashville via railroad during this trip, but the author knows of his own personal knowledge that there were times when he got his fresh provisions along the road."
"This expedition cost the Union army thirty thousand men and the Confederates thirty-five thousand. Besides, Georgia was the Confederacy, so far as arms, grain, etc., were concerned. Sherman attributed much of his success to the fact that he could repair and operate the railroad so rapidly. Among his men were Yankee machinists and engineers, who were as necessary as courageous fighters."
"""We are held here during many priceless hours,"" said the general, ""because the enemy has spoiled this passenger engine. Who knows any thing about repairing an engine?"""
"""I do,"" said a dusty tramp in blue. ""I can repair this one in an hour."""
"""What makes you think so?"""
"""Well, I made it."""
This was one of the strong features of Sherman's army. Among the hundred thousand who composed it there were so many active brains and skilled hands that the toot of the engine caught the heels of the last echoing shout of the battle.
"Learning that Hood proposed to invade Tennessee, Sherman prepared to march across Georgia to the sea, and if necessary to tramp through the Atlantic States."
"Hood was sorry afterwards that he invaded Tennessee. He shut Thomas up in Nashville after a battle with Schofield, and kept the former in-doors for two weeks, when all of a sudden Thomas exclaimed, ""Air! air! give me air!"" and came out, throwing Hood into headlong flight, when the Union cavalry fell on his rear, followed by the infantry, and the forty thousand Confederates became a scattered and discouraged mob spread out over several counties."
"The burning of Atlanta preceded Sherman's march, and, though one of the saddest features of the war, was believed to be a military necessity."
Those who declare war hoping to have a summer's outing thereby may live to regret it for many bitter years.
"However, the suggestion was not acted on. The Colonial soldiers declined to put on a bright red coat and a pill-box cap, that kept falling off in battle, thus delaying the carnage, but preferred to wear homespun which was of a neutral shade, and shoot their enemy from behind stumps. They said it was all right to dress up for a muster, but they preferred their working-clothes for fighting. After the war a statistician made the estimate that nine per cent. of the British troops were shot while ascertaining if their caps were on straight.[4]"
"General Israel Putnam was known as the champion rough rider of his day, and once when hotly pursued rode down three flights of steps, which, added to the flight he made from the English soldiers, made four flights. Putnam knew not fear or cowardice, and his name even to-day is the synonyme for valor and heroism."
CHAPTER XV.
"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, LL.D., PH.G., F.R.S., ETC."
"It is considered advisable by the historian at this time to say a word regarding Dr. Franklin, our fellow-townsman, and a journalist who was the Charles A. Dana of his time."
"Franklin's memory will remain green when the names of the millionaires of to-day are forgotten. Coextensive with the name of E. Rosewater of the Omaha Bee we will find that of Benjamin Franklin, whose bust sits above the fireplace of the writer at this moment, while a large Etruscan hornet is making a phrenological examination of same."
But let us proceed to more fully mark out the life and labors of this remarkable man.
"Benjamin Franklin, formerly of Boston, came very near being an only child. If seventeen children had not come to bless the home of Benjamin's parents they would have been childless. Think of getting up in the morning and picking out your shoes and stockings from among seventeen pairs of them!"
"Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where you would be called upon every morning to select your own cud of spruce gum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window-sill! And yet Benjamin Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea, and to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer."
"It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great Archimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of freedom."
"It is claimed that Franklin, at this time, invented the deadly weapon known as the printer's towel. He found that a common crash towel could be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and roller-composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it would harden so that ""A Constant Reader"" or ""Veritas"" could be stabbed with it and die soon."
"Many believe that Franklin's other scientific experiments were productive of more lasting benefit to mankind than this, but I do not agree with them."
"His paper was called the New England Courant. It was edited jointly by James and Benjamin Franklin, and was started to supply a long-felt want."
"Benjamin edited it a part of the time, and James a part of the time. The idea of having two editors was not for the purpose of giving volume to the editorial page, but it was necessary for one to run the paper while the other was in jail."
"In those days you could not sass the king, and then, when the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper and took out his ad., put it off on ""our informant"" and go right along with the paper. You had to go to jail, while your subscribers wondered why their paper did not come, and the paste soured in the tin dippers in the sanctum, and the circus passed by on the other side."
"How many of us to-day, fellow-journalists, would be willing to stay in jail while the lawn festival and the kangaroo came and went? Who of all our company would go to a prison-cell for the cause of freedom while a double-column ad. of sixteen aggregated circuses, and eleven congresses of ferocious beasts, fierce and fragrant from their native lair, went by us?"
"At the age of seventeen Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to Philadelphia and New York, where he got a chance to ""sub"" for a few weeks and then got a regular ""sit."""
"Franklin was a good printer, and finally got to be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the composing-room and spitting on the stove, while he cussed the make-up and press-work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms and scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy."
He knew just how to conduct himself as a foreman so that strangers would think he owned the paper.
"In 1730, at the age of twenty-four, Franklin married, and established the Pennsylvania Gazette. He was then regarded as a great man, and almost every one took his paper."
"Franklin grew to be a great journalist, and spelled hard words with great fluency. He never tried to be a humorist in any of his newspaper work, and everybody respected him."
"Along about 1746 he began to study the habits and construction of lightning, and inserted a local in his paper in which he said that he would be obliged to any of his readers who might notice any new or odd specimens of lightning, if they would send them in to the Gazette office for examination."
"Every time there was a thunderstorm Franklin would tell the foreman to edit the paper, and, armed with a string and an old door-key, he would go out on the hills and get enough lightning for a mess."
"In 1753 Franklin was made postmaster of the Colonies. He made a good Postmaster-General, and people say there were fewer mistakes in distributing their mail then than there have ever been since. If a man mailed a letter in those days, old Ben Franklin saw that it went to where it was addressed."
"Franklin frequently went over to England in those days, partly on business and partly to shock the king. He liked to go to the castle with his breeches tucked in his boots, figuratively speaking, and attract a great deal of attention."

LA GUERRE
"Ma soeur, vous souvient-il qu'aux jours de notre enfance,"
"En lisant les hauts fails de l'histoire de France,"
"Remplis d'admiration pour nos frères Gaulois,"
Des généraux fameux nous vantions les exploits?
"En nos âmes d'enfants, les seuls noms des victoires"
Prenaient un sens mystique evocateur de gloires;
On ne rêvait qu'assauts et combats; a nos yeux
Un général vainqueur etait l'égal des dieux.
Rien ne semblait ternir l'éclat de ces conquétes.
Les batailles prenaient des allures de fêtes
Et nous ne songions pas qu'aux hurrahs triomphants
"Se mêlaient les sanglots des mères, des enfants."
"Ah! nous la connaissons, hélas, l'horrible guerre:"
"Le fléau qui punit les crimes de la terre,"
Le mot qui fait trembler les mères à genoux
Et qui seme le deuil et la mort parmi nous!
Mais ou sqnt les lauriers que réserve l'Histoire
A celui qui demain forcera la Victoire?
Nul ne les cueillira: les lauriers sont flétris
Seul un cypres s'élève aux torubes de nos fils.]
LADY DEDMOND.  Without letting you know?
GEORGE.  I believe she did tell me.
LADY DEDMOND.  But surely----

"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."

think it's a great pity you ever came across him.

GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.

"at all.  A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir."
GEORGE.  What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?

GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?

GEORGE.  Send Burney.

GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables.  BURNEY comes in

LADY DEDMOND.  Is anyone else coming?
"GEORGE.  Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Softly]  You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to"
speak to you for a long time.  It is such a pity you and Clare--What
is it?
"GEORGE.  God knows!  I try, and I believe she does."

distressin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know it's been going on for a long time.
"GEORGE.  Oh!  leave it alone, mother."
"LADY DEDMOND.  But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a"
point--put ideas into her head.
GEORGE.  You can't dislike him more than I do.  But there's nothing
one can object to.
"LADY DEDMOND.  Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home?"
Brothers sometimes----
GEORGE.  I can't bear my affairs being messed about----

GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.

him?
CLARE.  A mind.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.

GEORGE.  Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir."
GEORGE.  Well?
"BURNEY.  I don't think she meant it, sir."
"GEORGE.  I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact."
"BURNEY.  Yes, sir.  The mistress said: ""I hope it'll be a pleasant"
"evening, Burney!"""
GEORGE.  Oh!--Thanks.
"BURNEY.  I've put out the mistress's things, sir."
GEORGE.  Ah!
"BURNEY.  Thank you, sir.  [She withdraws.]"
GEORGE.  Damn!
"He again goes to the curtained door, and passes through."
"PAYNTER, coming in from the hall, announces: ""General Sir"
"Charles and Lady Dedmond.""  SIR CHARLES is an upright,"
"well-groomed, grey-moustached, red-faced man of sixty-seven, with"
"a keen eye for molehills, and none at all for mountains.  LADY"
"DEDMOND has a firm, thin face, full of capability and decision,"
"not without kindliness; and faintly weathered, as if she had"
SIR CHARLES.  I'm fond of her.  Nothing she wants that she hasn't
"got, is there?"
HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget
if you know him.
HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
LADY DEDMOND.  He's literary.  [With hesitation]  You--you don't
think he--puts--er--ideas into her head?
"HUNTINGDON.  I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a"
"bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows.  Can't see Clare----"
"LADY DEDMOND.  No.  Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be"
encouraged.  Listen!--It is her-coming in.  I can hear their voices.
Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The
"door bell rings] Tt!  There he is, I expect."
SIR CHARLES.  What are we goin' to say?
"HUNTINGDON.  Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for"
them.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!

anything of that sort to heart so--especially Clare.

HUNTINGDON.  Don't know where the mischief lies.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road.  Very

"untidy, and his dress clothes not too new."
LADY DEDMOND.  How do you do?  My son and daughter-in-law are so very
sorry.  They'll be here directly.

"SIR CHARLES.  [Shaking hands] How d'you do, sir?"
"HUNTINGDON.  We've met, I think."

But all she could get out was:

He drew his hand back.

When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of
"the alphabet, cross-reference from the rejected one, as _Thomas"
Cantuariensis_. See _Thomas Becket_.
Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"
"_Brown_ and _Browne_, and the French names beginning with _Saint_ and"
_Sainte_. As readers may not always know the spelling of the author's
"name, cross-references should be made: e.g., _Brown_. See also _Browne_."
Arrange by the forename headings in which the family name is the
same.
"No attention is to be paid to prefixes, as _Bp., Capt., Dr., Hon., Sir,"
"Fräulein, Miss, Mlle., Mme., Mrs._, or to suffixes, as _D.D., F.R.S.,"
"LL.D._, etc."
"When the forenames are the same, arrange chronologically."
"No attention is to be paid to the titles _Sir_, etc.: e.g., _Bart, T."
"L._, comes before _Bart, Thomas_, for the same reason that _Bart_ comes"
before _Barta_.

"glowed in the light of midmorning, but her face was pale and a little"

"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"

Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.

"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""

Fiorsen said violently:
"""Look here: I have done with your friendship--you are no friend to me.  I"
"have never really known you, and I should not wish to.  It is finished."
"Leave me in peace."""
Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"
"that.  Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds."""
"""Well, I will pay it.""  Rosek's eyebrows mounted.  ""I will.  Gyp will"
"lend it to me."""
"""Oh!  Is Gyp so fond of you as that?  I thought she only loved her"

"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the

_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"
Wherefore I beseech you with me to be a witness
That in all my life I never intended thing less.

"""How can you trust the likes of him?"""
"""We've got to,"" she said. ""We've got to."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said Andrews. ""I can't."""
"She looked at her employer seriously. ""We've both got to trust him,"""

scathingly.

"Reluctantly, Andrews nodded. ""I suppose you're right."""

They walked to the Piazza del Popólo and through the Via Babuino to the
Piazza di Spagna.
“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling
"rosaries and photographs who spoke scarcely any Italian or French, but"
did speak Spanish. Probably he was a Jew.
"Cæsar asked him where they manufactured those religious toys, and the"
pedlar told him in Westphalia.

"She said nothing, but fixed her eyes on his."
"""I am right?"" he asked. ""It is about--my wife?"""
"She bowed her head. He stood silent for a moment, and she cried,"
"""It was only gossip--a woman's gossip; I did wrong to listen to it."""
"""Gossip,"" he said, ""is often true. This is true,"" and he set his lips."
"The worst often finds or makes people calm. She had flushed at first,"
"but the colour went again, and she said quietly,"
"""If you have time and don't mind, I should like to hear it all."""
"She had forgotten what this request must mean to him, or perhaps she"
"thought the time for pretence had gone by. If so, he understood, for he"
"answered,"
"""It's your right."""
"Her eyes sank to the ground, but she did not quarrel with his words. She"
stood motionless while he told his story. He spoke with wilful brevity
and dryness.
"""I was a young man when I met her. She was married, and I went to the"
"house. Her husband----"""
"""Did he ill-treat her?"""
"""I don't know. Why?"""
"""I wonder if I could get one."""
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Don't you think it might attract people to the place? Oh, well, perhaps"
"it wouldn't."""
And Paul withdrew.
Madder than ever. Some people see flies. Paul saw goldfish.

The lawyer is constantly in Miss Torsen's company; he even swings her in
"the children's swing, and puts his arm around her to steady her when the"
"swing stops. Solem watches all this from the field where he is working,"
and begins to sing a ribald song. Certainly these two have so ill-used him
"that if he is going to sing improper songs in self-defense, this is the"
"time to do it; no one will gainsay that. So he sang his song very loud,"
and then began to yodel.
"But Miss Torsen went on swinging, and the lawyer went on putting his arm"
round her and stopping her....
It was a Saturday evening. I stood talking to the lawyer in the garden; he
"didn't like the place, and wanted to leave, but Miss Torsen would not go"
"Frank Corson sat down. He saw the man and he saw Rhoda, but they seemed"
unimportant. Something had happened to his mind and he was busy
struggling with it. That was all that was important.
The strange lethargy that came like a cloud over his mind was beyond
understanding.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"
"us to be good little boys and go hand out parking tickets?"""
"""It wasn't like that,"" Taber said."
"""It doesn't much matter how it was. The thing is--how is it going to be"
"now?"""
"""You got a murder, friend. Plain and simple. What do the New York police"
"do when they get a murder?"""
"Abrams spoke bitterly. ""Sometimes they let a panel truck drive in and"
"haul the body away and that's that."""
"""Let's save the sarcasm until later. I called you in. It's your case."
"What do you want me to do?"""
"""Talk a little, maybe. The other one--now this one. The same killer?"""
"""Oh, I'm--I'm--sick!"" broke in Pola."
"""Sit up straight and talk and you won't think about it,"" commanded"
"Mart, so sternly that Pola straightened, her white face wan in the"
darkness.
"""I don't see how you _can_ talk when you're--may be--going--to die!"""
"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""
"""But I--I don't _want_ to--die."""
"""Who does?"" retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless, touched by Pola's"
"helplessness, she found Pola's hand and held it close in hers. ""But"
"let's face whatever happens with our heads up!"""
"""To the wind,"" breathed Sidney, shivering."
"""I--I just can't be brave like you two. I--I'm an awful coward. I can't"
help it. I've always been afraid to even try to swim. I'm afraid of
"lots of things. Oh, I'm afraid to--to--"""
Sidney caught Pola's other hand.
"""Don't say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find us. And probably you can't"
"help feeling afraid."""
Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had brought. She found them
where she had hidden them at the back of one of the bunks.
"""Here, eat a cookie and you'll forget things. I'm hungry, aren't you,"
"too?"""
The word “Number” has been omitted: thus Hymn 22 means Hymn No. 22.
_Cf._ means compare. (Latin: confer).
"The original texts of German hymns found throughout the _Handbook_,"
"especially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions used in"
"one or more of the following works: _Gesangbuch mit Noten_, (Berne,"
"Ind., 1890); _Gesangbuch der Mennoniten_, (Canadian, 1942); _The"
"Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal_, (Concordia Pub. House, 1942);"
_Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen und häuslichen Gebrauch in
"Evangelischen Mennoniten-Gemeinden_, (Konferenz der süddeutschen"
"Mennoniten zu Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 1910); and Knapp, _Evangelischer"
Liederschatz_. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these
"versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater"
knowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has
been made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;
the use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the
"pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals."

2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train"
overweights it.”
"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,"
"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,"
he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls
were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his
drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at
the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man
climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?
"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered."
"“What do you say, father?”"
"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at"
"them. “I shan’t dress to-night,” he repeated."
"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs."
Teddie Walker.”
“It will look so _very_ out of the picture.”
"“Don’t you feel well, dear?”"
“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”
"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered."
“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that
little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....
"Entman's little eyes shone with affection. ""I can only wish you good"
"luck."""
"""Thanks. I'll need it."""
"""And one more thing I was wondering."""
"""What's that?"""
"""Why do you suppose the tenth android killed the one in the Village?"""
"""Another case of taking one reason for want of a better one. I think it"
was his way of delivering the creature to us for research. He couldn't
"know for sure that we already had his 'brothers.'"""
"""You're right--you must be,"" Entman agreed."
"""Small consolation. I'd like a few facts to go on for a change instead"
"of having to depend on logic all the time,"" Taber growled."
"""What are you referring to?"""
"""The data. I'm assuming, _if_ that's what's important, that the tenth"
"creature has a way of getting the stuff back up there."""
"""I can help a little on that,"" Entman said. ""I can assure you that from"
"what I've found in those brains, the data could, most likely, be sent"
"mentally."""
"""You're sure of that?"""
passing reference to yesterday's tragedy.
"""I didn't like him at all,"" she said; ""but still it's dreadful--a man"
"one knew ever so slightly!"""
"Alicia agreed, and the next instant she found herself practically alone"
with Medland; for Daisy ran off to pick a wild-flower that caught her
"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.
"""Mr. Medland!"""
"""Yes?"""
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
"Though I go bare, take ye no care,"
I am nothing a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.
"Back and side go bare, go bare,"
Both foot and hand go cold:
"But belly, God send thee good ale enough,"
Whether it be new or old.

[HODGE _hears of the loss of the needle on his return home from the
fields._]
_Hodge._ Your nee'le lost? it is pity you should lack care and
endless sorrow.
"Gog's death, how shall my breeches be sewed? Shall I go thus"
to-morrow?

"What devil had you else to do? ye keep, ich wot, no sheep."
"Crane thing, I'm sure you realized that our talk was ... well, the words"
were put into my mouth. I felt the same way about the oaf as you did.
"But sometimes, in the line of duty, old man ... well, I know you were"
"reading between my lines all the time."""
"""I'm pretty good at that."""
"""I knew we understood each other."""
"""Is that what you called about?"""
"""Yes, but I've got a little tip for you. They want to see you upstairs."
I happen to know they liked the way things turned out. Just between you
"and me, the humiliation of Crane made certain high officials pretty"
"happy. I was queried and I gave you all the credit."""
"""Before or after the good Senator fell on his face?"""
"Halliday laughed. ""Okay, pal. You're entitled to your little dig. But"
"you know this--I'm with you and I always will be."""
"""And I'm with you, too, pal,"" Brent said wearily and hung up."
"The phone rang again. Automatically, Brent picked up the receiver."
"""Brent? Porter on this end. How is it with you, old man?"""
"""Ducky. Just ducky."""
"Porter laughed. ""Just called to say, 'Good job well done.'"""
"""Thanks."""
"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"""He'll take offense,"" the lawyer murmured, considering the matter."
But Solem urged him on:
"""I don't think so. Anyhow, you were the first one to talk about it."""
"""Everybody here will know, and I'll be prevented,"" said the lawyer."
"""We can go at dawn,"" said Solem."
In the end they came to an agreement.
"""You won't tell anyone?"" the lawyer said to me."
*       *       *       *       *
The lawyer was missed in the course of the morning; he was not in his
"room, and not in the garden."
"""Perhaps the Danish mountaineer can tell us where he is,"" I said. But it"
transpired that the Dane had not even thought of climbing the Blue Peak
"that day, and knew nothing whatever about the expedition."
This surprised me greatly.
I looked at the clock; it was eleven. I had been watching the peak through
"my field glasses from the moment I got up, but there was nothing to be"
seen. It was five hours since the two men had left.
At half-past eleven Solem came running back; he was drenched in sweat and
exhausted.
"“Come,” he said, “we must first sup.”"
"She gathered up her skirts, and slipped her hand through his arm. They"
"climbed up to the courtyard, and so into the street, and out into the"
night.
Madelaine sat on the side of the bed and undressed.
It was a sadly simple undressing.
She was languid with sleep.
"Noll went and looked out of the window, where Paris lay below him,"
blinking her thousand eyes....
He roused and went to the bed.
The dark head on the pillow lay very still. The girl was fast asleep.
Noll went back to the window--it was the window from which Horace had
gazed down upon the world the night before Noll and Betty had come to
Paris.
"And as Noll so stood, his brows hard knit upon the problems of his"
"life, the night slowly passed."
The rustle of a woman’s skirt had been in his ears all day--in his
"blood. This girl had brought back to him, of a sudden, the fragrance of"
his marriage.
And this beautiful winsome girl--what was to be the end?
"“By the way, I think your old admirer, Severance, must be about to put"
"himself in silken fetters, as Boswell would say. I caught him buying an"
unusually fine sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said it was for his
sister. H’m—h’m.”
“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”
“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here in Newport.”
“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”
"“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never seemed to pay her much attention,"
though. She’s not my style; too much like sixteen dozen other New York
girls.”
"He buttoned up his coat, braced himself against it, and gave his"
moustache a frantic twist.
"“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately, “you are engaged to"
me—won’t you—won’t you—”
She drew herself up and glanced down upon him from her higher chair with
a look of sad disapproval.
"“I did not think it of you, Teddy,” she said. “And it is one of the"
things of which I have never approved.”
"“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly."
“I thought you knew me better than to ask such a question.”
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—

"What did it mean? Hastily, I could fill in “Dearest Nettie,” and “I am"
"dying to see you.” Kennedy added, “The Recherche to-day,” that being"
"the name of a new apartment uptown, as well as “love and many kisses.”"
But “—rman”—what did that mean? Could it be Herman—Herman Schloss?
She was returning and we resumed our seats quickly.
Kennedy took the jewel case from her and examined it carefully. There
was not a mark on it.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said slowly, rising and handing it back to her,"
“have you told me all?”
"“Why—yes,” she answered."
Kennedy shook his head gravely.
“I’m afraid not. You must tell me everything.”
"“No—no,” she cried vehemently, “there is nothing more.”"
"We left and outside the Deluxe he paused, looked about, caught sight of"
a taxicab and hailed it.
“Where?” asked the driver.
"“Across the street,” he said, “and wait. Put the window in back of you"
"down so I can talk. I’ll tell you where to go presently. Now, Walter,"
sit back as far as you can. This may seem like an underhand thing to
"do, but we’ve got to get what that woman won’t tell us or give up the"
case.”
"""Why, I saw him with Mr. Puttock."""
"""Yes; but Mr. Puttock knows nothing of him, except that he said he came"
from Shepherdstown. That's why Puttock was civil to him. The place is in

"""Got any idea, sir?"" the subordinate ventured to ask."
"The Superintendent was about to answer in the negative, when a detective"
entered the room.
"""Well, I've found one missing man for you,"" he said, in a satisfied"
tone.
"""One missing man!"" echoed his superior, scornfully. ""In a place o' this"

"The sergeant went on, unperturbed,"
"""François Gaspard, known as politician and agitator, didn't go home to"

"""Oh!"" said the Superintendent morosely. ""Left an address?"""
"""Left no address, sir."""
"""How did he go, and where?"""
"""Not known, sir."""
_gentleman_.”
"“Yes. Our gardener’s son has joined a circus too. Such an amusin’ boy,"
he was.”
"“It brings it all so home to one, doesn’t it!”"
"“Doesn’t it, indeed! But I confess I have always been fascinated by the"
stage. There’s somethin’ so very romantic about livin’ in green-rooms
"and paintin’ your face, and--pretendin’ to be someone else.”"
The other whispered in her ear.
"The lorgnettes were flicked open again, and glittered upon Sir Gilders"
Persimmon.
“Indeed! But he is so very old--and she--but there is such a difference
of social rank between a baronet’s wife and a mere painter--surely!
"Still, he _is_ very old. Almost permissible sin, Gerty.”"
They both tittered.
"“My dear,” said the other, “you are really quite naughty.”"
"Sir Gilders pounced upon Fosse, whom he had followed round the room,"
"put up a hand to aid his dull hearing, and said:"
“You were speaking of dotage----”
Fosse winced uneasily:
"“No, sir,” he shrieked--“I was _not_ talking of dotage. I say that the"
"Young men's Christian associations, mercantile library"
"associations, and the like, should have local entry."
Private schools having no distinctive name go under the name of the
proprietor.
"Private libraries, galleries and museums go under the name of the"

"Buildings are for the most part provided for in the above rules, as"
"museums, galleries, libraries, churches, etc. Any others should"
"be entered under their names, with a cross-reference from the"
city.
"Headings like _Charles_, _George_, _Henry_, when very numerous,"
"must be divided into classes, in this order: Saints, Popes,"
"Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Noblemen, others. The Saints are"
"sub-arranged by their usual appellatives, the Popes by their"
"number, Sovereigns and Sovereign princes in alphabetical order"
"of countries, and under countries numerically. Other persons"
"are sub-arranged by their usual appellatives, neglecting the"

"""Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?"" Vance leaned back."
"""We need to plan our day."""
"""Quite simply, I thought it was time you and I got reacquainted, Dr."
"Vance. It's been a long time."""
"""Eight years."""
"""Yes. Eight years . . ."" There was a pause. ""If you would excuse me a"

The speaker clicked off.
"""Michael, I've got a very bad feeling about all this."" She was rising"

consent to join me this afternoon for tea. We have some urgent matters

"""How long will that be?"" Slyne inquired. He, too, was smiling"
ecstatically.
"""Not much more than a fortnight,"" the lawyer informed him. ""It will soon"
"pass. We must just be patient."""
"""We must keep very quiet, too,"" said Slyne, ""unless we want to give the"
whole show away to the enemy in advance. We must clear off out of London
"till then. I'll tell you what, Jobling! Why shouldn't we all go down to"
"Scotland to-night?"""
"Mr. Jobling nodded agreement. ""An excellent idea,"" he declared. ""There's"
"nothing to keep us here."""
"""That's settled, then,"" Slyne asserted. ""And we'll all dine together at"
the Savoy before we start. I think we can afford to celebrate the

“Then we both saw the light creeping over the sea like a monstrous
"ghost. And it all lay so pallid and still,--did n't it?--as if it were"
a sea in a land of death. And then a cheeky little thrush began to
twitter.”
"“I heard the thrush,” replied John. “He said, 'Any old thing! Any old"
thing!' ”
He mimicked the bird's note. Stella laughed. “That's just what he
said--as though a sea in a land of death or the English Channel was all
the same to him. I suppose it was.”
"“It must be good to be a thrush,” said Risca. “There 's a _je m'en"
fich'isme_ about his philosophy which must be very consoling.”
"“I know what that is in English,” cried Stellamaris. “It is"
'don't-care-a-damativeness.' “ Her lips rounded roguishly over the
naughty syllable.
“Where did you learn that?”
“Walter told me.”
"“Walter must be clapped into irons, and fed on bread and water, and"
seriously spoken to.”
Unconsciously he had drifted into his usual manner of speech with her.
She laughed with a child's easy gaiety.
"“It's delightful to be wicked, is n't it?”"
“Why?” he asked.
"“Oh, but I assure you--they told me it was to be a fancy-dress affair.”"
Rippley bawled at the door:
“Sir Gilders Cinnamon!”
Sir Gilders Persimmon shuffled into the room; and Pangbutt went to meet
the old baronet.
"“Lady Persimmon coming to-night, Sir Gilders?” he shouted into his ear;"
the old man shook his head.
"“Sorry,” bawled Pangbutt into his ear; “Sir Gilders, allow me to"
"introduce Mr. Fosse, who, I need not tell you, is the well-known"
critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:
“Eh?” said he--“borrow? Why borrow?”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” cried Fosse, getting very hot--“I did not say"
borrow--I said my eulogy appears to-morrow.”

"_Far_, *** B. F."
"_Far_ ..., J. B."

The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.

"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"

"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"

"""A mystery--eh?"" he exclaimed, instantly interested.  ""Tell me about"
"it."""
"""This place,"" I replied, ""belongs to the Countess de Foville, a lady"
"whom I knew well when I was at the Brussels Embassy, and it is her"
"daughter Yolande who has been found dead in this room this evening."""
"""Yolande de Foville!"" he repeated, with knit brows.  ""She was a friend"
"of yours once, if I mistake not?"" he added, looking me straight in the"
face.
"""Yes, Dick, she was,"" I responded.  ""I told you of her long ago."""
"""You loved her once?"""
"""Yes,"" I answered with difficulty, ""I loved her once."""
"""And how did the unfortunate affair occur?"" he asked, folding his arms"

"He seemed to express the general feeling, but men were reluctant to"
"acknowledge so disappointing a conclusion, and the preparations for"
departure were slow and lingering. They had not fairly begun before Mr.
Kilshaw's entrance abruptly checked them. Instantly he became the centre
of a crowd.
"""Now, Kilshaw,"" they cried, ""you know all about it. Oh, come now! Of"
"course you do! Secret? Nonsense! Out with it!"" and one or two of his"

interest.
"""Benham!"" he remarked. ""I never heard the name, did you?"""
"""You know him, Ned,"" said the doorkeeper's wife; ""him as Mr. Gaspard"
"used to go about with."""
"By a sudden common impulse, the eyes of the two men met; the woman went"
"off to brew them a pot of tea, and left them fearfully gazing at one"
another.
"""What stuff!"" said the watchmaker uneasily. ""It was only his blow. What"
"reason had he--?"" He paused and added, ""Seen him to-day, Ned?"""
"""No,"" answered Ned, fingering his note."
"""Wasn't he in the procession?"""
"""I didn't see him."""
"""When did you see him last?"""
The doorkeeper hesitated.
"""Night of our last committee,"" he whispered finally."

Gyp shook her head.
In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
"primitive emotion.  Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew"
"his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,"
muttered:
"""Go upstairs."""
"The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped"
"up Gyp's rage against men.  When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his"

The waiter came bringing Cæsar’s breakfast. “Will you tell me what it
"is?” said Cæsar to the ecclesiastic, while he filled his cup."
"The monk waited until the waiter was gone, and then said in a hard"
voice:
“His Eminence the Cardinal sent me to bid you not to present yourself
"anywhere again, giving his name.”"
"“What? What does this mean?” asked Cæsar, calmly."
“It means that His Eminence has found out about your intrigues and
machinations.”
“Intrigues? What intrigues were those?”
“You know perfectly well. And His Eminence forbids you to continue in
that direction.”
“His Eminence forbids me to pay calls? And for what reason?”
“Because you have used his name to introduce yourself into certain
places.”
“It is not true.”
“You have told people you went to that you are Cardinal Fort’s nephew.”
"“And I am not?” asked Cæsar, after taking a swallow of coffee."
"“You are trying to make use of the relationship, we don’t know with what"
end in view.”
"The old man became all the more frightened, and glanced at his face."
"""You are lying!"" he said scornfully, when the teacher had finished."
"""What lie have I told?"" asked the teacher."
"""You mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the Bible."""
"He got up and walked away, angry and deeply insulted."
"""You will go mad, Tyapa,"" called the teacher after him with conviction."
"Then the old man came back again, and stretching out his hand,"
threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger.
"""God made Adam--from Adam were descended the Jews, that means that all"
"people are descended from Jews ... and we also ..."""
"""Well?"""
"""Tartars are descended from Ishmael, but he also came of the Jews ..."""
"""What do you want to tell me all this for?"""
"""Nothing!  Only why do you tell lies?""  Then he walked away, leaving"
his companion in perplexity.  But after two days he came again and sat
by him.
"""You are learned ...  Tell me, then, whose descendants are we? Are we"
"Babylonians, or who are we?"""
"""We are Slavs, Tyapa,"" said the teacher, and attentively awaited his"

"The horseman looked for a moment in Francesco's face but, hardened as"
"he was, he dared not abide the trial. There was such a stare of"
"desperate calm in the dark eyes, that his courage failed and quailed"
from the truth. He hung his head and stood mute.
"""I listen--"""
"""My lord--"""
"""For God's sake, speak out!"""
"""My lord--"""
"""The truth!""--"
"""She lives--"""
"A great silence fell within the hearts of the three, an ecstasy of"
"silence, such as comes after the wail of a storm. The duke's lips were"
"compressed, as if he feared to give expression to his feelings."
Francesco's face was as the face of one who thrusts back hope out of
"his soul. He sat rigid on his horse, a stone image fronting Fate,"
"grim-eyed and steadfast. All his life had been one long sacrifice, one"
"long denial,--had it all been in vain?"
There were tears in the eyes of the man-at-arms.
"""What more?"""
"""Come and help us!"" he called excitedly to the group of guests."
"""What's happened?"" somebody asked."
"""He fell off."""
How tired Solem was and drenched to the skin! But what could we do? Rush
up the mountainside and look at the accident too?
"""Can't he walk?"" somebody asked."
"""No, he's dead,"" said Solem, looking from one to another of us as though"
"to read in our faces whether his message seemed credible. ""He fell off; he"
"didn't want me to help him."""
A few more questions and answers. Josephine was already halfway across the
field; she was going to the village to telephone for the doctor.
"""We shall have to get him down,"" said the Danish mountaineer."
So he and I improvised a stretcher; Solem was instructed to take brandy
"and bandages to the site of the accident, and the Bergensians, the"
"Associate Master, Miss Torsen, and Mrs. Molie went with him."
"""Did you really say nothing to Solem about climbing the peak today?"" I"
asked the Dane.
"""No,"" he replied. ""I never said a word about it. If I had meant to go, I"
"should certainly not have wanted company...."""

He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the

"Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated."
Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly
narrowing to none.
"Vera indicated his Ruger. ""You would be wise to put that away. Now."""
"""If they take these securities, my life's not worth a _kopeck_."""
"Novosty seemed to be thinking out loud. ""What does it matter."""
It wasn't a question. It was a statement.

sequence of events. He did remember shoving Eva back against the wall

asked.

"am feeling out my future course, taking soundings.”"
"“But the support you could find here would be all of a clerical nature,”"
said Kennedy.
“Of course.”
“But you are not Clerical!”
“No; but it is necessary for me to climb. Afterwards there will be time
to change.”
"“You are not taking it into account, my dear Cæsar, that the Church is"
still powerful and that it doesn’t pardon people who impose upon it.”
“Bah! I am not afraid of it.”
"“And you were just saying you are not courageous! You are courageous, my"
"dear man.... After this, I don’t doubt of your success.”"
“I need data.”
"""What is your name?"" asked the girl from underground."
"""Self is my name,"" said the woman."
"That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she once more began to pull"
"the fire apart. Then the woman grew angry and began to scold, and built"
"it all up again. Thus they went on for a good while; but at last, while"
they were in the midst of their pulling apart and building up of the
"fire, the woman upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground. Then"
"the latter screamed and ran away, crying:"
"""Father, father! Self burned me!"""
"""Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer for it!"" came the"
answer from below the hill.
NOTE.
"""Self Did It"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 10. From the"
"vicinity of Sandakar, told by a half-grown boy) belongs to the"
"cycle of the Polyphemus fairy-tales, with a possible glimmer of"
the old belief that beings low in the mythological scale are most
easily controlled by fire.

There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"

"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"
"know about his boots."""
"""But what could he have been doing up there?  Unless----"""
There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.

"a surgeon, he was taken in place of their present one, if the latter"
wished to leave. But when Scudamore came on board the _Royal Fortune_ he
"“Are you sure he did it?” asked Kennedy, more, I felt, for its moral"
effect on her than through any doubt in his own mind.
"“Not sure. But then the wall safe shows no marks, and the replica is"
gone.”
“Might I see your jewel case?” he asked.
“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably
have to fuss a long time with the combination.”
In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"
"drumming absently on the arms of his chair, suddenly rose and walked"
quietly over to a scrap basket that stood beside an escritoire. It had
"evidently just been emptied, for the rooms must have been cleaned"
several hours before. He bent down over it and picked up two scraps of
paper adhering to the wicker work. The rest had evidently been thrown
away.

Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”

Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"

advanced to her.
"“It is very soon to come again,” he said, “but I simply had to call and"
inquire if you felt better. I am delighted to see that you apparently
do.”
"“I am better, thank you.” Her voice was weak. “It was good of you to"
come again.”
“Whose ring is that?”
“Why—a—to—sure—”
"“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have you gone off with my ring again? You"
are so absent-minded! I hunted for that ring high and low!”
"“You should not be so good-natured, and my memory would turn over a new"
"leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the ring to Miss Decker and raised her"
eyes guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and get the other?”
“No. But I thought you promised never to take it off.”
“I forgot that water ruins stones.”
"“Well, it is a consolation to know that water does not ruin a certain"
plain gold circlet.”

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
"One of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping, in June,"
"1724. He was not one of the original crew of the _George_ galley, but was"
taken out of a prize and joined the pirates of his own free-will.
"ROBBINS, JAMES."
Hanged in Virginia in 1718 along with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.
"ROBBINS, JAMES."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"
Carolina.
"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"
"""Charmed to see you in London, _mon confrère_,"" said he. ""Have you yet"
"discovered your man?"""
"""I am hard at his heels,"" the detective answered, his eyes searching"
"Slyne's as if, Sallie thought, for some sign that that shaft had hit"
home.
"But Slyne's expression was one of ingenuous simplicity. He bowed, as if"
with deep respect.
"""I caught a glimpse of some one most amazingly like myself, one day on"
"the Faubourg St. Honoré, as I was passing through Paris,"" he mentioned"
reflectively.
"""Thanks,"" returned Dubois. ""It was he, no doubt. And--he's in London"
"now."""
"Slyne did not wince, even at that."
"""He was dining at the Savoy to-night,"" said Dubois indifferently. ""How"
"does your own affair progress?"""
"""_Assez bien_,"" Slyne answered in an even voice. ""I have followed my"
"quarry home and am awaiting developments."""
"""You will be in London for a little, then?"""
"""For the next week or ten days, I expect,"" Slyne lied with perfect"
aplomb.
"""We shall meet again, in that case,"" declared the detective, glancing at"
"Sallie; and, ""_Au plaisir de vous revoir, monsieur_,"" Slyne returned"

And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats
they owned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that
"sprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one. “He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for"
"twenty years. On his last legs, I guess.”"
The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp
in the hand of the sleeper.
"“Gee!” he remarked. “He’s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish I"
knew the brand of hop that he smokes.”

"with much feeling. ""An' I want you to do the same for me."""
"Silently, inscrutably, the gambler dealt the ten cards, one by one. But"
"as the Girl started to draw hers toward her, his long, thin fingers"
reached across once more and closed not ungently upon hand and cards.
"""The last hand, Girl!"" he reminded her. ""And I've a feeling that I"

"her fingers with his own, he stole a glance at his cards."
"Chicago or Boston some traveller will find an abandoned chapel, and will"
ask: ‘What is this? ‘And they will tell him: ‘This is what remains of
the Catholic Church.’”

"“I don’t know who Homais is,” retorted Cæsar."

... I think I have read it.”
"The woman opened the door and they went into the church. It was small,"
overcharged with ornaments. They saw the tomb of Bishop Spinelli and
"Giotto’s Virgin, and then went into a hall gay with red flags with a"
"white cross, on whose walls they could read the names of the Grand"
Masters of the Order of Malta. The majority of the names were French and
"Polish. Two or three were Spanish, and among them that of Cæsar Borgia."
"“Your countryman and namesake was also a Grand Master of Malta,” said"
Kennedy.
"“So it seems,” replied Cæsar with indifference. “I see that you speak"
with contempt of that extraordinary man. Is he not congenial to you?”
“The fact is I don’t know his history.”
“Really?”
"“Yes, really.”"

240 miles on the mainland of America.

He climbed the steps of the brownstone and tried the knob. The door
"opened. He went inside and found himself in a drab, dark hall furnished"
"with an umbrella stand, a worn carpet, and a table spread with mail."
"There was a bell on the table. He tapped it and, after a lazy length of"
"time, a shapeless woman came through a door on the right and regarded"
him with no great show of cordiality.
"""Nothing vacant, mister. Everything I've got is rented."""
"""I wasn't looking for a room. I'm just doing a little checking."""
"""My license is okay,"" the woman said belligerently. ""The place is clean"
"and orderly."""
"""That's not what I'm checking about. There's been some counterfeit money"
"passed in this neighborhood and we're trying to trace it down."""
The woman had a pronounced mustache that quivered at this news.
"""Counterfeit! My roomers are honest."""
"""I'm sure they are. But some people carry counterfeit money without"

"""Only two of them."""
"""Men or women?"""

"""But how did the terrible affair occur?"""
"""We have no idea,"" answered the Countess brokenly.  ""She was found lying"
upon the floor of the salon within a quarter of an hour of the departure
"of her visitor, who proved to be yourself.  Jean, the valet-de-chambre,"
"on entering, discovered her lying there, quite dead."""
"""Astounding!""  I gasped.  ""She was in perfect health when I left her."""
"She shook her head sorrowfully, and her voice, choking with grief,"
declared:

"""But she has,"" she declared.  ""I am absolutely positive of it!"""

A PIECE OF PLAIN PAPER.
"""What medical examination has been made?""  I demanded."
"""None,"" responded the Countess.  ""My poor child is dead, and no doctor"
"can render her assistance.  Medical aid is unavailing."""
"""But do you mean to say that on making this discovery you did not think"
"it necessary to send for a doctor?""  I cried incredulously."
Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"
French newspapers.”
Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”
"“I can’t,” drawled Ffolliott miserably--“I am quite angry with"

And human love without the pain.

Free of the day and all its cares!

Too long to last where joy is brief.

"""That's his plan,"" said Big George, sourly, ""It's an old game, but it"

"I've studied this point of land for five years, and I know more about"

"""Double it,"" Tommy laughed. ""We agreed last night that you looked like a"
"million-dollar bill to us!"""
"""Oh, my boys,"" Monsieur sputtered with embarrassment and pleasure, ""you"
"disarm my power to thank you--see, I blush!"""
"""Damned if he isn't,"" Tommy grinned at me. ""What d'you know about this"
"little gezabo, anyhow!"""
Monsieur's face grew more composed as he showed his interest in a new
word.
"""You say--gazebo?"" he asked, blandly. ""Is that not a belvedere?"""
"""Gazebo is, yes; but I said gezabo--that's you!"""
"""Your American Indian language?"""
"""Sure thing. Pure talk. If you're interested in Indians, stick around."
"Why not get the Havana police to help us hunt the kiddie?""--I had known"
that before long Tommy would be using a first personal pronoun.
"""Bah! They are of no value! But even I have small hope of finding her."
"The report was written nearly six years ago, and she has been gone"
"upwards of twenty years."""
"""So it's a she,"" Tommy looked over at me and nodded. ""Well, nearly six"
"years, and upwards of twenty, plus what she was when she left home,"
leads me to believe the lady's almost old enough to take care of
"herself!"""
"""That is true,"" Vaviloff nodded, ""I knew that before."""
"""Well, what then?"" asked the merchant, loudly."
"""Nothing ...  Let us be friends!"""
"""It is nice to see that you have decided so quickly. Look here, I have"
already prepared a notification to the court of the withdrawal of the
"summons against my father. Here it is; read it, and sign it."""
"Vaviloff looked at his companion with his round eyes and shivered, as"
if experiencing an unpleasant sensation.
"""Pardon me ... sign it?  And why?"""
"""There is no difficulty about it ... write your Christian name and"
"surname and nothing more,"" explained Petunikoff, pointing obligingly"
with his finger to the place for the signature.
"""Oh!  It is not that ...  I was alluding to the compensation I was to"
"get for my ground."""
"""But then this ground is of no use to you,"" said Petunikoff, calmly."
"""But it is mine!"" exclaimed the soldier."
"""Of course, and how much do you want for it?"""
"""Well, say the amount stated in the document,"" said Vaviloff, boldly."
"""Six hundred!"" and Petunikoff smiled softly.  ""You are a funny fellow!"""
said he. “Look here”--he slapped the old man’s chest jocosely--“your
master and the amateur aristocracy used to have private theatricals
here. Where are his wigs and make-up things? Where does he keep them?
Quick!”
The old butler promptly began to retire backwards upon a handsome
cabinet:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen; surely I have no need to remind you that Mr."
"Pangbutt’s wigs are his private property,” said the shocked, anxious"
old man. “I haven’t Mr. Pangbutt’s permission----”
"Rippley followed him up, grimly smiling:"
"“Get out, you old panjandrum!” said he. “You’ve shown the hiding-place,"
you naughty old deceiver. Go away!”
"He pushed the expostulating old man from the cabinet, and, throwing"
"open the drawers, proceeded to ransack them."
“Hullo!” he cried--“splendid!”
He struck a match:
“Spirit lamp--everything. Ginger! Here’s a glorious short beard affair
that goes down the middle of the chin and all along the throat.”
He put it on.

Ireland in 1648 with seven ships. His own ship was the _Swallow_. He was a

“Yes. Do you like that type?”
“She has a lot of character. She looks like one of the women that would

The Russian was smiling vaguely. Laura told the coachman to drive on.

He left the matron and darted back into the room.
"“I'm sure there must be something you would like me to bring you,” he"
whispered. “Don't be afraid. Any mortal thing.”
The child's lips twitched and she looked nervously from side to side.
“What is it? Tell me.”

"When Herold returned to his dressing-room after the first act,--the"

"“Hallo, John! I did n't know you were in front. Why did n't you tell me?"
"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic
"reception of a new play. His glow sat rather oddly upon him, for he was"
"made up as a decrepit old man, with bald wig, and heavy, blue patches"
beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."
"“I see now,” smiled Herold, glancing at his friend's loose tweed suit."
No clothes morning or evening ever fitted Risca. Herold called him “The
Tailors' Terror.”

From the great doorway:
“Mistair and Mrs. Nezzerbie Gomme!” announced Rippley; and as the pair
"were greeted by all near them, Rippley stepped to the head of the great"
"stairs, and going up to a pompous man as that worthy set foot on the"
"topmost step, he said to him confidentially:"
"“I say, mister, would you mind running down the stairs and telling the"
fellar with the red hair that I want him?”
Sir Tankerton Wollup swelled slowly:
"“Pooh--pooh!” said he, drawing himself up; and he strutted to the door."
“Poof--poof!” said Rippley. “Giddy old thing!”
"He glanced over the balustrade down to the next landing, and caught"
Doome’s eye:
“Beelzebub!” he growled--“the whole town’s coming to this silly

"""Luck."""
"""Spaceman's luck, Admiral."""
Wilson went back to his brooding....
Charles Andrews came back into the salon with a brisk air. He
"flexed his arms, took a deep breath, and mopped his forehead with a"
handkerchief. He sat down beside Alice and smiled at her warmly.
"""That thing is a wonder worker,"" he said, breathing deeply. ""Nothing"
"like exercise to make a man feel fine and fit."""
"Alice looked up at him with some amusement. ""Mr. Andrews, tell me. Are"
you the kind of man who opens the window on a winter morning about six
"o'clock, and takes deep lungsful of icy air?"""
"""Not quite that bad, my dear. Not quite. But brisk living does keep a"

Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."

a sheaf of notes from his jacket pocket.
"""I've known Mr. Dennis for quite some time,"" Frank commented wryly."
"""Be quiet."""
John Dennis' tone was neither hostile nor friendly. They were the words
of a person whose mind was on other things. They watched him as his eyes
scanned the notes.
He appeared to be memorizing them.
"The air became somewhat electric, the silence so deep it seemed to"
scream. Rhoda looked across at Frank Corson. Frank's expression was
"empty, as though he'd suffered some traumatic emotional blow and was"
struggling to recover.
John Dennis stirred. He also appeared to be struggling. He turned his
eyes on the drink Rhoda was holding. He took it out of her hand and
downed it in a single gulp.
"They watched as he went back to work, leafing through the notes, one at"
"a time. As he came close to the end, he lifted his head and shook it"
"violently, as though from sudden pain. He scowled at the empty glass"
he'd handed back to Rhoda.
"""Do you want another?"" she inquired."
"""Give me another."""
She poured a second Scotch and handed it to him. He drank it like so
much water.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""
"""No, I don't believe it yet!"" rapped out the Girl, laying great stress"
"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"

Wednesday 10:30 A.M.
"An armoured van with V.C.S., Ltd. lettered on its side pulled up to the"
black marble front of Moscow Narodny Bank's financial trading branch on
Saint Swithins Lane. Everything was on schedule.
"""They're here."" Eva was watching from the narrow window. Saint Swithins"
"Lane down below, virtually an alley, was so narrow it could accommodate"
"only one vehicle at a time. Across was Banque Worms, its unicorn"
"insignia staring out, its lobby chandeliers glowing. Nobody there even"
bothered to notice. Just another armored truck interrupting the view.
Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached
"the rear doors from both sides, .38's in unsnapped holsters."
"""Mr. Vance, they had better have the money, all of it."" Vera stepped"
over to the window and followed Eva's gaze down.
"""It'll be there."""
"""For your sake I hope so,"" she replied as she turned back."
"""Just hang around and watch,"" Vance said."

Don’t break the butterfly.

NOLL.
P.S.--I am tired of myself. I am off to find Betty.”
Noll sealed the letter and wrote a third--to the concierge:
"“MADAME,"
I am called away to England. Mademoiselle Madelaine Le Trouvé has
been good enough to take charge of the rooms until madame and
myself return. Pray give the enclosed to your little ones ‘from the
Englishman who knows how to laugh.’
"Agréez, etc.,"
OLIVER BADDLESMERE.”
"He stole to where Madelaine slept, and on the chair by her bed he put"
her letter and some banknotes.
"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"
"leather kit-bag, and carried it to where the candle gave light. From"
"the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two trinkets,"
and very carefully wrapped them up. They too went into the bag.
"""You needn't believe _me_,"" he answered her. ""Ask Mr. Jobling. He'll"
"tell you."""
"Mr. Jobling coughed importantly. ""I'll tell you all I know myself, Lady"
"Josceline,"" he promised her, and proceeded to repeat in part what he had"
"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"
"long."""
Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.
"""And before that--?"" he suggested, politely patient."
"""Before that she was--what she still is so far's I'm concerned--Saleh"
"Harez, my adopted daughter."""
"""In case,"" Kilshaw read, ""of my death or disappearance, please deliver"
"this parcel to Mr. Kilshaw, Legislative Assembly, Kirton."""
"""I'm sorry to say, sir,"" said the Superintendent, ""that the detective"
sergeant conducting the search took upon him to open this packet in the
presence of one or two persons. It ought to have been opened by no one
"but----"""
"""Myself."""
"""Pardon me, but myself,"" said the Superintendent, with a slight smile."
"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"
"everywhere; you can't keep 'em out."""
"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"
"photograph of two persons, a young woman and a young man. ""Look at the"
"back,"" he added."
"Kilshaw looked, and read--""My wife and M."""
"""That's the deceased's handwriting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""And you know the persons?"""
"""I've no doubt about them. It's the Premier--and--and Mrs. Medland."""
"Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling"
"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.

"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."
"for the disapprobation of the Kirton mob, they held that in high scorn."
"""They'd cheer burglary, if Medland did it,"" said one."
"""Well, he wants to, pretty nearly,"" added a capitalist."
"""But the country will take a very different view. Puttock'll rub it into"
"all his people: _they_'ll not vote for him. What do you say, Coxon?"""
"""I think we shall beat him badly,"" said that gentleman, as he rose and"
went out.
"Captain Heseltine soon followed, and was surprised to see Coxon's figure"
just ahead of him as he entered the gates of Government House.
"""Hang the fellow! What does he want here?"" asked the Captain."
"Mr. Coxon asked for Lady Eynesford. When he entered, she rose with a"
newspaper in her hand.
"""What a shocking, shameful thing this is!"" she said. ""What a blessing it"
"is that the Government was beaten!"""
Coxon acquiesced in both these opinions.
"""I never thought well of him,"" continued the lady. ""Now everybody sees"
him in his true colours. And it's you we have chiefly to thank for our
"deliverance."""
"Coxon murmured a modest depreciation of his services, and said,"
"""I hope Miss Derosne is well?"""

"They saw the model of an ancient galley which was in the same hall, and"
went out through the church into the garden planned by Piranesi.
"The woman showed them a very old palm, with a hole in it made by a"
hand-grenade in the year ‘49. It had remained that way more than half
"a century, and it was only a few days since the trunk of the palm had"
broken.
"From the garden they went, by a path between trees, to the bastion of"
"Paul III, a little terrace, from which they could see the Tiber at their"
"feet, and opposite the panorama of Rome and its environs, in the light"
of a beautiful spring sunshine....
"XVIII. CÆSAR BORGIA’S MOTTO, “AUT CÆSAR, AUT NIHIL”"
_THE BORGIAS_
The next day was one of the days for visiting the Borgia Apartment.
"Cæsar and Kennedy met in the Piazza di San Pietro, went into the"
"Vatican museum, and walked by a series of stairs and passageways to the"
Gallery of Inscriptions.
"Then they went down to a hall, at whose door there were guards dressed"
“Poor great men!” exclaimed Cæsar. “Their statues serve only to
"decorate a public garden.” “They had their lives,” replied Laura, gaily;"
“now we have ours.”
Laura ordered the coachman to stop a moment. The air was still murmuring
"in the foliage, the birds singing, and the clouds flying slowly across"
the sky.
A man with a black box approached the carriage to offer them postcards.
"“Buy two or three,” said Laura."
Cæsar bought a few and put them into his pocket. The vendor withdrew
and Laura continued to look at Rome with enthusiasm.
"“Oh, how beautiful, how lovely it is! I never get tired of looking at"
"it. It is my favourite city. ‘_O fior d’ogni cittá, donna del mondo_.’”"
"“She is no longer mistress of the world, little sister.”"
“For me she is. Look at St. Peter’s. It looks like a shred of cloud.”
"“Yes, that’s so. It’s of a blue shade that seems transparent.”"
Bells were ringing and great majestic white clouds kept moving along the
horizon; on the Janiculum the statue of Garibaldi rose up gallantly into
"the air, like a bird ready to take wing."
"“When I look at Rome this way,” murmured Laura, “I feel a pang, a pang"
of grief.”
"Rippley clasped his hands together unctuously, bowed, smiled a large"
"Italian smile. He advanced a step, and said with a strong foreign"
"accent, picking his words with slow deliberation:"
“Sir Pangboot--it has arrive to ze domestic bootler that he is
indispose sudden-ment. I am he’s friend that he have ask to take he’s
"place, vis my asseestants.... Your house shall have ze much honour in"
my hands--we have the habit to attend ze best families----”
There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.
Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:
"“I must be going mad,” he said."
Rippley bowed:
"“Sir Pangboot--me and me friends, we speak not very well ze"
Engleesh--but we much understand it well--and----”
"“Yes, yes.” Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. “Get to your"
business.... Curse it! I wonder what on earth ails Dukes.”
"As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he hesitated,"
"bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly burst a bloodvessel"
as the tragic Blotte’s moustache fell off. But Pangbutt had suddenly
remembered that he was host; and advancing into the room he turned to
the others:

He tore it open and—it was empty.

THE GERM LETTER
“Did you know that this man was alive when you married me?” he asked in
a hard voice.
"“No,” cried Yvonne. “How could I have married you? I thought he had been"
dead nearly three years.”
“What proofs did you have of his death?”
"“A friend sent me a number of the Figaro, with the announcement.”"
“Was that all?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne."
"“Do you mean to tell me,” he insisted, “that you married a second time,"
having no further proofs of your first husband’s death than a mere
newspaper report?”
"“It never occurred to me to doubt it,” she replied, opening piteous,"
innocent eyes.
The childlike irresponsibility was above his comprehension. Her apparent
insensibility to the most vital concerns of life was another shock to
him. It seemed criminal.
"“God forgive you,” he said, “for the wrong you have done me.”"
"“But I did it unknowingly, Everard,” cried poor Yvonne. “If one has to"
"get greater proofs, why did you not ask for them, yourself?”"

"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her

"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"But she herself owned this to be as inartistic as it was unintentional,"
"stamping her foot with annoyance at the mischance. Indeed, she"
"apologized most handsomely; for, said she, pathetically, when she had"

It was an anticlimax.
She threw down the whip and said he might now go home.
He now went home.
There is little reason to doubt that the horsewhipping by Gaston
Latour’s sister hastened Mr. Myre’s desire to start the great
renaissance of the English drama.
As he stood before the mirror in his rooms at his hotel and shaved
"off the remains of his drooping moustache by the candle’s light, and"
"soothed the aching bumps that were risen upon his face, he sniffed"
loudly through a swollen nose--he had very tender places--and decided
to go to Rouen until the hair grew.

"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am

"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""

Born at Lower Shadwell.
"Boatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while"
"lying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates"
"from Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the"
"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"
"offered to him on a dish, on which lay a loaded pistol beside the copy of"
the articles.

Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"

"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."
"Certainly, if we trust Evans, Gaspard hinted designs on some one before"
he could have known Benyon had this money. Could he have known he was
"going to have it?"""
"""Benyon may have told him I had promised to help him."""

A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet
"To stand and watch the roofs, the sky."
"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.
"How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!"
"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!
"Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!"
"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.

"Alive within my eyes, I turned;"
"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."

"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"
contents ...
"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"

inevitable encounter that could make him master of the world!

"""You left her here?"" he inquired, interrupting.  ""Yes, in this very"
room.  But it seems that a quarter of an hour later one of the servants
"entered and discovered her lying upon the door, dead."""
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Has a medical man seen her?"""
"""No.  The Countess sent for me as being one of her daughter's most"
"intimate friends, and I, in turn, sent for you."""
"""Where is the poor young lady?"""
"""In her room at the end of the corridor,"" I answered hoarsely."
"""Is there any suspicion of murder?"""
"""Apparently none whatever.  She had no visitor after I left."""
"""And no suspicion of suicide?"" he asked, with a sharp look.  ""Did you"
"part friends?"""
"""Perfectly so,"" I responded.  ""As to suicide, she had no reason, as far"
"as anyone knows, to make an attempt upon her life."""
He gave vent to an expression which sounded to me much like a grunt of
dissatisfaction.
"""Now, be perfectly frank with me, Gerald,"" he said, suddenly turning to"
"me and placing his hand upon my shoulder.  ""You loved her very dearly"
"once--was that not so?"""
I nodded.
"clue?"""
"""Not what you'd call a clue. Did you know the gentleman, sir?"""
Kilshaw replied by saying that Mr. Puttock had introduced Benham to him
and the acquaintance had continued--it was a political acquaintance
purely.
"""You don't know anything about him before he came here?"""
"Kilshaw suddenly perceived that he was being questioned, whereas his"
object had been to question.
"""You say,"" he observed, ""that you haven't got what you'd call a clue."
"What do you mean?"""
"""You can tell Mr. Kilshaw, if you like,"" said the Superintendent to the"

"""Gaspard! why that's the fellow the Premier--"" and Mr. Kilshaw stopped"
"short. After a moment, he asked abruptly, ""Were there any papers on the"
"body?"""
"""None, sir."""
"""I suppose there's nothing really to connect this man Gaspard with it?"""
"""Oh, nothing at present, sir. Did you say you'd known the deceased"
"before he--?"""
"""If I'm called at the inquest, I shall tell all I know,"" said Kilshaw,"
"rising. ""It's not much."""
"""At present they cannot tell,"" I responded.  ""Some deleterious substance"
"is suspected, but until she has returned to consciousness and can give"
"us some details of her sudden attack we can determine nothing."""
"""But she will recover, m'sieur?"" the Countess asked.  ""Are you certain?"""
"""The chances are in her favour, the doctors say.  They have given her a"

I repeated my question.
Solem denied he had said any such thing.

"""No, you didn't,"" he said."
A pause.
"Suddenly he dropped to the floor of the shed, convulsed, without shape, an"
outline merely; a few minutes passed before he got up again. When he was
last he stood still before her.
"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.
The Girl turned upon him with eyes flashing and retorted:
"""Well, it's my throat, ain't it?"""
"""Well I'll be!--"" The Sheriff's sentence was left unfinished, for Nick,"
"quickly pulling him to one side, whispered:"
"""Say, Rance, the Girl's cut up because she vouched for 'im. Don't rub it"
"in."""
"Notwithstanding, Rance, to the Girl's query of ""How did this Nina"
"Micheltoreña know it?"" took a keen delight in telling her:"
"""She's his girl."""
"""His girl?"" repeated the Girl, mechanically."
"""Yes. She gave us his picture,"" went on Rance; and taking the photograph"
"out of his pocket, he added maliciously, ""with love written on the back"
"of it."""
"A glance at the photograph, which she fairly snatched out of his hands,"
convinced the Girl of the truthfulness of his assertion. With a movement
"of pain she threw it upon the floor, crying out bitterly:"
"""Nina Micheltoreña! Nina Micheltoreña!"" Turning to Ashby with an abrupt"
"change of manner she said contritely: ""I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, I vouched"
"for 'im."""
The Wells Fargo Agent softened at the note in the Girl's voice; he was
about to utter some comforting words to her when suddenly she spoke
Perhaps--perhaps we may have doubted the man somewhat over-hastily. But
"as for me, I will answer for La Giralda."""
"""For me,"" said El Sarria, sententiously, ""I will answer for no"
"woman--save only Dolóres Garcia!"""
Concha looked up quickly.
"""I also am a woman,"" she said, smiling."
"""And quite well able to answer for yourself, Señorita!"" returned El"
"Sarria, grimly."
For the answers of Ramon Garcia were not at all after the pattern set by
Rollo the Scot.
CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."
CHAPTER XXII
"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room
"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"
"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""
"ever played.  The Chopin polonaise in A flat, that song of revolution,"
"which had always seemed so unattainable, went as if her fingers were"
"being worked for her.  When she had finished, Monsieur Harmost, bending"
"forward, lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it.  She felt the"
"scrub of his little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh"
of satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"
"inspiration of your--master!"""
Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.
"The old man drew himself up.  ""Monsieur,"" he said, ""you are certainly"
"drunk."""
"Gyp slipped between, right up to those outstretched hands till she could"
And jammed neatly down behind it was the body of Les King. His throat
had been cut.
Brent Taber stared down into the closet for what seemed like an
interminable time. His eyes were bleak and his mouth was grim and stiff
as he passed a slow hand along his jaw.
"He took a long, backward step and closed his eyes for a moment as though"
hoping the whole improbable mess would go away. But it was still there
when he opened them again.
"He turned, went downstairs, and took the receiver off the phone on the"
wall by the front door.
"The shapeless landlady came out again. She scowled at Taber. ""What are"
"you doing here?"""
"He regarded her with a kind of affectionate weariness. ""Have you got a"
"dime, lady?"""
"Gaping, she pawed into her apron pocket and handed him a coin."
"""Thanks much."" He dialed. ""Is Captain Abrams there?"""
"There was a wait, during which Brent Taber asked the oddly bemused"
"landlady: ""Are you afraid of the dead?"""
"But before she could decide whether she was or not, Taber turned to the"
"phone. ""Captain?.... That's right, Brent Taber ... No, right, here in"
Manhattan. There's been a little trouble. You'd better come over
"personally."""

"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:
"goin'."""
"He bowed her out of the room, and then, snatching up his hat and cane"
"with very visible annoyance, included the others in a curt nod of"
farewell and made off himself.
He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have
paused there.
"""You won't forget me, will you?"" she heard him ask eagerly from behind"
her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.
"""We're going to talk business for a few minutes,"" he told her, ""and then"
get everything settled in writing--to keep you safe.
"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"And we, alike from each remote,"
"The world that works, the heaven that waits,"
"Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote,"

"And fain would love, and only seem"
To love because we cannot love.
"Draw back the blinds, put out the light:"
"’Tis morning, let the daylight come."
"God! how the women’s cheeks are white,"
And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!
EMMY.
"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air,"
"Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,"
"Come to me out of the past, and I see her there"
As I saw her once for a while.
"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright,"
"Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,"
"And still I hear her telling us tales that night,"
Out of Boccaccio’s book.
"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,"
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
"“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s sake,” said Severance. “It is"
enough to have read them.”
"“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed Teddy, “if you could have been at the"
"yacht race! Such excitement, such—”"
"“To change the subject,” said Trent, with determination in his eye,"
"“Mrs. Pendleton, did you receive all the marked papers I sent you"
"containing my speeches, especially the one on Jesuitism in Politics?”"
"“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose"
own egotism was kicking against its bars. “You did not think my book too
"long, did you? One purblind critic said—”"
"“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said Severance, rising abruptly. “Good"
"evening,” and he bowed to Miss Decker and to the men. Jessica rose"
suddenly and went with him to the door.
"“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”"
"she said, as she gave him her hand. “This may be unconventional, but _I_"
choose to do it.”
He bowed over her hand. “Mrs. Pendleton will only have set one more
"fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”"
"As he left the room by one door, Jessica crossed the room and opened"
another.
"“Good night,” she said to the astounded company, and withdrew."

"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"

"A Carolina pirate, accused and acquitted on a charge of having captured a"

"TUCKER, ROBERT."
Of the Island of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at"
"Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not"
"defended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still"
"deemed it ""a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward."" We"
understand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded
"themselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the"
"famous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the"
"Court of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and"
all but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.
"TUCKERMAN, CAPTAIN."
Sailed with Captain Porter in the West Indies. Captain Johnson gives an
account of the meeting between these two pirate novices and the great
Captain Roberts at Hispaniola.
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""
THE POLICY OF THE _POTLUCK_.
"Concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships, the"
unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened
by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little.  He
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"
"_The Four P.P._ (? 1540), similarly, requires no more than a palmer, a"
"‘What does this mean, Pa?’ cried I."
"They gathered themselves up, shamelessly--laughed--ye gods, twittingly,"
"at _me_! Wholly unabashed, Pa, shaking himself into comfort in his"
"clothes, slapped me upon the back:"
"‘Horace, my son----’"
"‘Don’t be familiar, Sir Pompey,’ said I. ‘You are speaking to the heir"
to a baronetcy.’
The baronet laughed vulgarly:
"‘Mrs. Bartholomew Doome,’ he said--‘allow me to introduce to you"
"Horace, my son--at least, my reputed son.’"
"Bows, chassées, and greetings."
"‘Horace--the Misses Doome, Master Horace Doome, and Master Oliver"
Doome----’
The old gentleman slapped me upon the back again with mighty hand that
near drove me down amongst the fire-irons.
He dug me in the ribs:
"‘The rogue’s been married this seven years,’ cried he; ‘and now he’s"
"signed the deeds as partner in Malahide and Son, and you’re just in"
"the nick of time, the fool of a lawyer is upstairs--only--look here,"

"""To meet Sibyl!  Why?"""
"""That I cannot tell."""
"""But I think, Baronne, we may be both agreed upon one point."""
"""And that is?"""
"""That the man who now calls himself Rodolphe Wolf is here in Paris with"

"""I am entirely in accord, m'sieur--quite.  Some steps must at once be"

"While it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief"
message:
Dear Fellow Scientist:
A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's
future in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are
available. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the
Thinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected
the professional men. Now both times are past. May they never
"return! I would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock"
"sharp, Thinkers' Foundation I."

Meanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced
"through them, hesitated at the name ""Willard Farquar,"" looked at the"
"sleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and"
plugged in the steno-robot.
The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.
"""The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,"" a clear feminine voice"
"announced. ""He has the general staff with him."""
"""Martian peace to him,"" Jorj Helmuth said. ""Tell him I'll be down in a"

"""No,"" said Etienne, coolly. ""You see, my cousin might not give me"
"another!"""
But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods
as even Rollo himself.
"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the
"chance for worlds, so he replied serenely, ""Do you still intend to shoot"
"us?"""
"""What has that to do with the matter?"" growled Cabrera, who was losing"
his temper.
"""Because if you do,"" said Etienne, who had been waiting his opportunity,"
"""you are welcome to the jewel--_after_ I am dead. But if I am to live, I"
"shall require it for myself!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
THE BURNING OF THE MILL-HOUSE
"Cabrera bit his lip for a moment, frowned still more darkly, and then"
"my being cried out to you--yet all was dark about me, horrible"
"midnight, peopled with foul forms! Oh, that night,--that night--"""
"Shivering, she covered her eyes as if trying to banish the memory."
"""It has passed,"" she breathed after a pause, during which Francesco"
"had taken her in his arms, kissing her eyes, her lips, and the"
"sylph-like, flower-soft face. ""I see the dawn!"""
"""Our dawn!""--Francesco replied, pointing to the hillock beyond."
"For a time there was a great silence, as if the fates of two souls"
were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.
"""How you have suffered!"""
"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.
"""It counts for naught now! Are not you with me?"""
The sky burned azure above the tree-tops. Transient sunshafts quivered
"through the vaulted dome of breathless leaves, as slowly Francesco and"
Ilaria strode towards the camp of the Duke of Spoleto on the
sun-bathed hillock above the Nera.
The End.
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."
"""I don't--"""
"“It has confirmed me in my idea, which I had lost for a few days.”"
“What idea is that?”

“Yes.”

"“I am glad, because you have such a pitiable air when you are sad. Would"
"you like to go to the Priory of Malta, which is only a step from here?”"
“Good.”
They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"
"property left, and all that remains are its memories and its archives.”"
“That is how our descendants will see our Holy Mother the Church. In
not to come again.

SAN BLAS WOMAN IN DAILY GARB]
"“Among the San Blas Indians, who are at a far higher level of"
"civilization, the exclusion of aliens is the result of well-founded"
political reasons. Their respected traditions are a long record of proud
independence; they have maintained the purity of their race and enjoyed
freely for hundreds of years every inch of their territory. They feel
that the day the negro or the white man acquires a foothold in their
"midst these privileges will become a thing of the past. This is why,"
"Germans, or any other barbarians.”"
"“Yes, this hotel is a hive of petty aristocrats.”"
“Your sister was telling me that you might pick out a very rich wife
"here, among the girls.”"
"“Yes, my sister would like me to live here, in a foreign country, in"
"cowlike tranquillity, looking at pictures and statues, and travelling"
pointlessly. That wouldn’t be living for me; I am not a society man. I
"require excitement, danger.... Though I warn you that I am not in the"
least courageous.”
“You’re not?”
“Not at all. Not now. At moments I believe I could control myself and
take a trench without wavering.”
"“But you have some fixed plan, haven’t you?”"
"“Yes, I expect to go back to Spain, and work there.”"
“At what?”
“In politics.”
“Are you patriotic?”
"“Yes, up to a certain point. I have no transcendental idea of patriotism"
"at all. Patriotism, as I interpret it, is a matter of curiosity. I"
believe that there is strength in Spain. If this strength could be
"led in a given direction, where would it get to? That is my form of"

REVENGE IN AN ALIEN WORLD
When Gail Loring chose Bill Drake to be her husband--in name only--for
"the duration of the flight to Mars, she didn't know that she had just"
signed his death warrant.
"Jealous Dr. Spartan, leader of the expedition, swore to get revenge and"
force Gail to share his maniacal plan for power.
"Bound together in space, five men and a woman strained against the"
powerful tug of twisted emotions and secret ambitions.
But all plans were forgotten when they landed on the Red Planet and
"encountered the Martians--half animal, half vegetable, with acid for"
blood and radar for sight.
"Jimmie told his chum of the arrival of Gilroy, and then the two boys"
hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys
"into their care,” Ned said, as they hustled along, “so I’m afraid"
they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

"While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,"
"As the midnight hour drew near,"

"She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told"
Tale after shameless tale.
"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,"
"Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,"
"And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,"

"""Well?"" she interrogated."
"""Well, we was sure that you was in trouble,"" put in Sonora. ""My breath"
"jest stopped."""
"""Me? Me in trouble, Sonora?"" A little laugh that was half-gay,"
"half-derisive, accompanied her words."
"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to
"have shrunken perceptibly as she stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly,"
into space.
"""We say that Johnson was--"" repeated Rance, impatiently."
"upon tier, against the gorgeous evening sky."
CHAPTER XIX
IN WHICH A MUTINY IS THREATENED
"Even after they were miles down the Sound, Boyd remained at his post,"
sweeping the waters astern in an anxious search for some swift harbor
"craft, the appearance of which would signal that his escape had been"
discovered.
"""I won't feel safe until we are past Port Townsend,"" he confessed to"
"Cherry, who maintained a position at his side."
"""Why Port Townsend? We don't stop there."""
"""No. But the police can wire on from Seattle to stop us and take me off"
"at that point."""
"""If they find out their mistake."""
"""They must have found it out long ago. That's why I've got Peasley"
"forcing this old tub; she's doing ten knots, and that's a breakneck"
"speed for her. Once we're through the Straits, I'll be satisfied. But"
"meanwhile--"" Emerson lowered his glasses with a sigh of fatigue, and in"
the soft twilight the girl saw that his face was lined and careworn.
"The yearning at her heart lent poignant sympathy to her words, as she"
together in the room where Yolande was lying.
"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""
"Thus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been"
confined in an asylum for lunatics.
NEAL.
A fisherman of Cork.
"Mutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under"
"the leadership of Philip Roche, murdered the captain and many of the crew"
and became a pirate.

the Council and a Colonel of the Militia. In order to set his son up in
"life he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young"
"Nelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to"

"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""

"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."

We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in

off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""

_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”
companions?”
"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.

"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”

NAVAL PRIZE BILL OF 1911
"_Passed by the House of Commons, but thrown out by the House"
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at

announced:

CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""
"""One hundred and sixty,"" Slyne told him, and evidently did not think it"
THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange
"thing about these men, namely, that they painted themselves to others"
worse than they actually were.  A man who has good in him does not mind
sometimes showing his worse nature.

"When all these people were gathered round the teacher, then the reading"
of the newspaper would begin.
"""Well, what does the newspaper discuss to-day?  Is there any"
"feuilleton?"""
"""No,"" the teacher informs him."
"""Your publisher seems greedy ... but is there any leader?"""
"""There is one to-day....  It appears to be by Gulyaeff."""
"""Aha!  Come, out with it.  He writes cleverly, the rascal."""
"""'The taxation of immovable property,'"" reads the teacher, ""'was"
"introduced some fifteen years ago, and up to the present it has served"
"as the basis for collecting these taxes in aid of the city revenue ...'"""
"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"occasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab"
"village, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,"
"as, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by"
"a treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this"
"cold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:"
thus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable
"man, who had always been the natives' best friend."
"NORTON, GEORGE."
"One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the"
Star Tavern at Boston.
"NUTT, JOHN."
One of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the
_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.
OCHALI. Barbary renegade.
In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.

Travers seized his arm. His eyes shone with a painful excitement.
"""Yes--yes!"" he stammered. ""You have a chance--a sure hope. I can save"

Nicholson freed himself resolutely from the clinging hands.

"an impossibility."""
"He turned away, but Travers caught his arm and held him with a"
"frantic, desperate strength."

"“Yes, yes; but we are not so conceited or such play-actors as you are."

We sat late after dinner. Somewhere in the hall Bilkins hovered with
glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.
In twenty years he had not omitted this New Year's Eve ceremony.
"""Your wound never troubles you?"" my mother asked, her solicitation over"

pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."
"""I'll bet you grew pretty ones on the cheeks of those French girls,"" he"
chuckled.
"""Pretty ones don't grow any more, on cheeks or anywhere else,"" I"
"doggedly replied. ""Materialism's the keynote now--that's why I'm going"

"""Oh,"" the Mater laughed, ""don't think of your father's stupid office,"

"""There's nothing left to think of,"" I grumbled."
"""Isn't there?"" he exclaimed. ""What'd you say if Gates has the yacht in"

"unveiling, I am too thrilled.”"
He kept button-holing Pangbutt:
"“Too thrilled to--er--I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed is"
"Charlotte--oh, ah, yes--Charlotte!” He searched about behind him for"
"the little old lady, who moved up to his side. “Oh, ah, yes--there"
"you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce Mr. Pangbutt, our host."
"May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth has yet arrived? No?..."
"How fortunate! How very fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite"
excited.”
Pangbutt led them to chairs.
Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as is
"concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and one,"
taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident that
"passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning, swept the room"
with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.
“How amusin’! how absolutely amusin’!” she crooned. “I like literary
and artistic people _so_ much.”
"“Yes,” said the other, “they are _so_ different to one’s own class...."
And actresses _dress_ so well!”
"She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something to"
the lady of the lorgnettes.
The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:

We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.

_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"
"a year ago. It never came back. I sent another ship, with two good men"
“Yes.”
“The artist is not living?”
"“For heaven’s sake, man! No.”"
"“Well, if he were alive today they would employ him to make those"
gewgaws some people present to leading ladies and to the deputies of
their district. He would be the king of the manufacturers of ornate
barometers.”
“It is undeniable that Bernini had a baroque taste.”
“He gives the impression of a rather pretentious and affected person.”
"“Yes, he does. He was an exuberant, luxuriant Neapolitan; but when he"
chose he could produce marvels. Haven’t you seen his Saint Teresa?”
“No.”
“Then you must see it. Let’s take a carriage.”
"They drove to the Piazza San Bernardo, a little square containing three"
"churches and a fountain, and went into Santa Maria della Vittoria."
"Kennedy went straight toward the high altar, and stopped to the left of"
it.
"In an altar of the transept is to be seen a group carved in marble,"
representing the ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Cæsar gazed at it absorbed.
"The saint is an attractive young girl, falling backward in a sensual"

"But he could not make his family laugh at this tale, either. His wife"
stood still; her face was beautiful.
"""So you're leaving now,"" was all she said."
Mr. Brede's porter came out with his luggage; he had stayed at the farm
for these three days in order to be at hand.
"Then the manufacturer walked down through the field, accompanied by his"
wife and children.
I don't know--this man with his good humor and kindliness and money and
"everything, fond of his children, all in all to his wife--"
Was he really everything to his wife?
"The first evening he wasted time on a party, and every night he wasted"
time in snoring. And so the three days and nights went by....

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in
"the field, men and women are at work; they go thinly clad and bareheaded,"
and call to one another and laugh; sometimes they drink from a bucket of
"whey, then set to work again. There is the familiar fragrance of hay,"
"which penetrates my senses like a song of home, drawing me home, home,"

"wrong idea. Let me hear your suggestions."""
"Twill and Naylo looked at one another, fencing with their eyes. Finally"
"Twill nodded and said, ""You say it, Regin."""
"""It's already been said."" Regin Naylo looked pointedly at Linus Brein."
"""A day or so ago you claimed that you'd picked up some primitive"
infrawave emission that looked as though someone might be trying to

"""Yes."""
"""Then it is my contention that any moves we make against this race"
should be made before anybody down there gets such a detector and

"""Why?"" demanded Viggon Sarri."
"Regin Naylo looked at his commander. ""We're losing a technical"
advantage. Whether we go in with a benign and peaceful-looking air and
"show them how big and fast we are, or whether we plunge in and hit 'em"

do it before anybody succeeds in making an infrawave space detector.
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.

"""That I could not speculate upon. The KGB seems to have a great"
interest in his activities. Perhaps they are guarding him in some more

be aware that the situation is not resolved. That you still have a

The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by
Winters had arrived.
We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who
"arrived about the same time, and followed Winters."
Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"
"Muller looked dazedly from one of us to the other, but shut up like a"
clam.
"“I think you had better come along with us as a material witness,”"
burst out Winters roughly.
"Kennedy said nothing, leaving that sort of third degree work to the"
"detective. But he was not idle, as Winters tried to extract more than"
"the monosyllables, “I don’t know,” in answer to every inquiry of Muller"
about his employer’s life and business.

The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes

CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.

in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the

nervousness which did not escape the sharp eye of the Sheriff.

Sonora breathed on his badly nipped fingers before answering:

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

THE FURNISHED ROOM
"Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of"
the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side.
"Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to"
"furnished room, transients forever—transients in abode, transients in"
"heart and mind. They sing “Home, Sweet Home” in ragtime; they carry"
their _lares et penates_ in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a
picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.
"Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers,"
"should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but"
it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the
wake of all these vagrant guests.

"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.

Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes
came in sight. Unfortunately their efforts at pursuit were futile.

"had been credited by her detractors, had shaken off the British"

"Nevertheless, her wings had been clipped, although she survived to"
tell the tale that the hated English were still able vigorously and
successfully to dispute the mastery of the air.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"""LIEUTENANT AUBYN, R.N., D.S.O."""
"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.
"""Hullo, Aubyn, old man!"" exclaimed the latter cordially, as he"
"extended his hand. ""Forgotten me already?"""
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.
"""Who are you?"" he asked wonderingly."
"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"
"the fourth satellite."""
"""Then you are not of these monsters of Jupiter?"""
"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"""What's the use of crossing bridges,"" Tommy grinned. ""If he won't"
"persuade, then sit on his head--anything, I don't care! The main thing"
"is--keep him!"""
CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"
"""What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We have no wives?"" said the"
"captain. ""Or do you happen to have done away with them?"" asked the"
quartermasters.
"""No, all of us together did away with them,"" answered the boy, and told"
them what he had heard and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
"watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and the captain was buying"
his deckload of wood.
And when they sailed home they learned that their wives had disappeared
"the day of the storm, and that since that time no one had seen or heard"
anything more of them.
NOTE
"A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of ""Storm Magic"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 248. From the vicinity of"
"Christiania, told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the ""Fritjof"
"Legend"" the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches,"
who call up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know
"the inner context of the cabin-boy's counter magic, and why it is"
"that the birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the"
power to destroy the witches.

"""A passable enough rendering, if I may say, though I don't necessarily"
"accept your analogy."" He reached down and lifted a bottle of warmed"
"sake from beside the brazier. ""By the way, I know you prefer tequila,"
"one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to acquire any. Perhaps"
"this will suffice."""
"He set down two black _raku_ saucers and began to pour. ""Now, alas, we"
"must proceed."""
"Post time, Vance thought."
"""Dr. Michael Vance."" He lifted his saucer in a toast. ""A scholar of the"
"lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of the Central"
"Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated with a"
group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last
"encounter."""
"""You haven't done too bad yourself."" Vance toasted him back. ""This new"
"project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot of style."""
"""It does indeed,"" he nodded. ""I'm quite proud of our achievement here."""
"""You always thought big."" Vance sipped again at his sake, warm and"
soothing.
"""It's kind of you to have remembered."" Mino drank once more, then"
for himself.
"""Congratulations."""
"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"
protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
"profits."""
"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""
"""I don't work for the mob, if that's what you're hoping."""
"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
tricks were the outcome of years of concentrated effort and constant
"exercise, and being moved by the Grace of God, he desired to offer the"
best thing he had to give to the Lord of Life. His best was his skill.
"He lived by it. Shown in the streets and the play places, it won for"
him his daily bread. His work was to give men amusement in their hours
of recreation by an exhibition of his feats of strength and
"nimbleness. Could this, his one talent, be consecrated and devoted to"
"God? So he considered, and humbly sought the sanctuary, and there"
before the Presence he performed his fantastic tricks which had cost
him years of endeavour. The story is a parable which men have not been
"slow to read, and it has become the theme of the musician and artist."

to his toast than to his visitor.
And then he added:
“The truth is that it would be extravagant behaviour on the part of

"under their long, black, thick brows, shot lightning."
“Poor wretch!” repeated the monk. “You ought to have more respect for

“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"

"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"

"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"

The finding of the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of
Admiralty for trying of pirates was as follows:
Acquitted                                 74
Executed                                  52

The rest were accounted for as follows:

"A number of the prisoners signed a ""humble petition"" begging that, as"
"they, being ""unhappily and unwisely drawn into that wretched and"
"detestable Crime of Piracy,"" they might be permitted to serve in the Royal"
"African Company in the country for seven years, in remission of their"
"crimes. This clemency was granted to twenty of the prisoners, of which"
Scot was one.
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."

Pangbutt’s handsome studio had been cleared for a reception; and the
"deliberate old butler, throwing open the great folding-doors, walked"
stiffly into the room and glanced an orderly eye round the brilliantly
lighted details in a last complacent survey before the near arrival of
the guests.
"He started at a loud peal of the door-bell, and pulled out his watch:"
“I hope they are arriving early enough!” said he. “It comes of arsking
these here artists to the house.... They’re always hungry and they’re
"always noisy, and they’re always thirsty. Even if I suffered from these"
here afflictions I’d have the manners not to show it.” He shrugged his
shoulders. “I call it letting ourselves down. They don’t even know how
to put on their clothes like Christians.”
"He straddled stiffly out of the room, grumbling and mumbling."
"“Leastwise not like Christians of the Established Church,” he"
growled....
He returned after awhile through the great hollow of the handsome
"doorway, ushering in four guests."
"When they had entered, he said stiffly:"
"“Mr. Pangbutt, I fear, will not be down for several minutes, gentlemen;"
he has only just come in to dress.”
"He drew out his watch from his pocket, and glanced at it aggressively."

"She took from her handkerchief a beautiful little casket of blue onyx,"
"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a
word.
"She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent, this is yours?—or is it the"
sapphire?”
"[Illustration: “‘WELL, WHY DON’T YOU GO?’”]"
"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"

"glance, then took his ring and strode feebly over the cliffs. Trent and"

"""Why, you're wounded!"" exclaimed the sub-lieutenant, noticing a dark"

"""Am I?"" asked Terence incredulously."
"Turning his head to ascertain the nature of his injury, of which"
"hitherto he was unconscious, his shoulder slipped along the curved"

collapsing inertly upon the deck of the ship he had brought safely
out of action.
"""Congratulations, old man. You'll have to get your tailor to make"

"""What do you mean?"" asked Terence."
Two months had elapsed since the day on which Lieutenant Aubyn had
received a dangerous wound in his right side in the fight off Ostend.
"He was sitting in the grounds of the Royal Naval Hospital at Chatham,"
having made a fairly rapid recovery.

Crane tossed the paper aside listlessly and picked up the second one:
SENATORS VOICE CONCERN FOR SANITY
OF COLLEAGUE
CRANE IN STUNNING TIRADE
WARNS OF SCIENCE-FICTION
DISASTER.
"The third paper featured an internationally syndicated columnist, famous"
for his biting wit:
*       *       *       *       *
Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America
space-conscious. If there was any Madison Avenue thinking behind the
launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"
the people Senator Crane-conscious rather than aiming their attention at
"orientation spin. He rolled to the side, flailing an arm to try and"
"recover his balance, but the room was in rotation, his vision playing"
tricks.
"The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him, a blurred"
"image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the"
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely
dreaming?
". . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion phantasmagoria of"
"pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out, but there"
"was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones. The"
"world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be"
"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red
"mist. He was floating, on a journey he had long waited to take, to a"
"place far, far away. . . ."

_Of Mr. Roberts' previous books the critics have written as follows_:
"""The action is always swift and romantic and the love is of the"
kind that thrills the reader. The characters are admirably
drawn and the reader follows with deep interest the adventures
"of the two young people.""--_Baltimore Sun._"
"""Mr. Roberts' pen has lost none of its cunning, while his style"
"is easier and breezier than ever.""--_Buffalo Express._"
"""It is a romance of clean, warm-hearted devotion to friends and"
duty. The characters are admirable each in his own or her own
"way, and the author has made each fit the case in excellent"
"fashion.""--_Salt Lake City Tribune._"
"""In this book Mr. Roberts has well maintained his reputation"
"for the vivid coloring of his descriptive pictures, which are"
"full of stirring action, and in which love and fighting hold"
"chief place.""--_Boston Times._"
"""Its ease of style, its rapidity, its interest from page to"

"pleasing.""--_The Reader._"

"“No, indeed,” the Englishman proclaimed."
Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
adorably red. There was a new and brilliant light in her eye; and after
"one curiously comprehensive glance at the company, she turned about to"
"look for her companion, La Giralda, who presently cantered up on a"
"lumbering Estramenian gelding. La Giralda sat astride as before, her"
"lower limbs, so far as these were apparent, being closely clad in"
"leather, a loose skirt over them preserving in part the appearance of"
sex.
Rollo was dumb with sheer astonishment. He could only gaze at the
"flushed cheek, the tingling electric glances, the air completely"
unconscious and innocent of the girl before him.
"""Concha!"" he cried aloud. ""Concha--what do you here? I thought--I"
"imagined you were safe at the Convent of the Holy Innocents!"""
"And from behind Sergeant Cardono marked his cheek, alternately paling"
"and reddening, his stammering tongue and altered demeanour, with the"
utmost satisfaction.
"""Good--good,"" he muttered under his breath to El Sarria; ""he will make a"
true general yet. The saints be praised for this weakness! If only he
"were fonder of his dinner all might yet be well!"""

THE MISSION OF THE SEÑORITA CONCHA
"""I too have a mission, I would have you know,"" said Concha, a dangerous"

"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
"""This idea is hopelessly haywire,"" Wilson said unhappily."
"""It sure is,"" said Space-Tech Maury Allison. ""But everything is, at"
"first."""
"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""
"""Some. We've had as much as five minutes of constant operation out of"
"it."""
"As he spoke, the hemisphere over their heads flashed a full bright"
"green, then went black. A bell tinkled somewhere and a couple of techs"
dropped their tools and headed for the back room on the double. A
couple of others stood up from their work and lit cigarettes because
their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.
[Illustration: The dome became a riot of flaming green.]
"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"
"Allison went on. ""We've never tested this outfit under anything"
but ideal conditions. We've had spacecraft sent out to specified
"distances, fired up the gizmo and found fragments of response right"
"where there should be a response."""
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."

"screeching gargoyles, instead, devoted all their efforts to merely"
hurling their attenuated bodies on the two men as though they wished
to capture them alive.
"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"
attackers opened his tiny mouth and piped a signal. The ring of
weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"
"them, and the fight was over."
CHAPTER III
_The Coming of Greca_
The numbing shock from the tubes left the Earthmen's bodies almost
paralyzed for a time; but their brains were unfogged enough for them
to observe only too clearly all that went on from the point of their
capture.
“I am not!” sobbed Jessica.
“You are.” He glanced about. No one was in sight. He put his arm about

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"
"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.

"he came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting."

"The dawn was streaking the east with faint gold, and transient"
"sunshafts touched the woods, when Francesco stood before the doorway"
of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.

_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”

passed in and closed the door. Somehow my fingers could not locate the

fast asleep.
CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."

"THE proper layout for an ordinary volume, arranged in accord with the"
"best usage, is as follows:"

"He would allow her a very free hand, so long as she did not attack"
the Germans or their allies or put in any false news about military

had been persecuted in England; give a description of forcible

"""Yes, almost immediately."""
"The doctors exchanged glances, which showed that the mark upon the lip"
was the chief enigma of the situation.
"Trepard glanced at his watch, dissolved yet another pillule of hydrated"

“Eh?” bawled Sir Gilders Persimmon.
All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little man
shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.
"“I was saying,” shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,"
“that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age for
himself.”
The old baronet shook his head:
“The man who what?”
Fosse licked his lips sullenly:
"“The man who doesn’t play whist,” shrieked Fosse, reddening miserably."
“What about him?” asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.
"“Lays up a sad old age for himself,” screamed the miserable little man."
The old gentleman knit his brows:
“A reformed rake?” he asked testily....

"It was a warm, sunny afternoon. About a dozen of us were pitching a"
"marquee in leisurely fashion, when suddenly there was a shout of ""Fritz"
"up!"""
"We gazed at the sky, and, after searching for a while, saw a tiny white"
"speck moving slowly across the blue at an immense height. Then, at some"
"distance from it, a small white puff, like a little ball of cotton-wool,"
appeared. A few seconds passed and we heard a faint pop. More puffs
"appeared around the moving speck, each one followed by a pop. All at"
"once, behind us, a bright tongue of flame flashed out above a group of"
"bushes. There was a sharp report and a whizzing, rustling noise that"
died down gradually. Then another puff and another pop. The bright
flames flashed out again in rapid succession. The little speck moved on
and on. Grouped closely round it were compact little balls of
"cotton-wool, but trailing behind were thin wisps and semi-transparent"
whitish blurs. Above a belt of trees in the distance we observed a
"So, with greatly altered circumstance, was it in the present instance."
Rollo kissed first and made up his mind to it some time after.
Consequently Concha was taken absolutely by surprise. She uttered a
little cry and stepped back indignantly into the lighted room where the
spare muskets were piled.
"But again Rollo was before her. If he had attempted to make love, she"
"would have scathed him with the soundest indignation, based on"
"considerations of time, place, and personality."
But the young Scot gave her no opportunity. In a moment he had again
become her superior officer.
"""Take your piece,"" he said, with an air of assured command, ""together"
"with sufficient ammunition, and post yourself at the little staircase"
window over the great door looking towards the town. If you see any one
"approaching, do not hesitate to fire. Good-bye. God bless you! I will"
"see you again on my rounds!"""
And Rollo passed on his way.
"Then with a curious constraint upon her tongue, and on her spirit a new"
and delightful feeling that she could do no other than as she was
"bidden, Concha found herself, with loaded musket and pistol, obediently"
taking her place in the general defence of the palace.
CHAPTER XXXII
"Robbins laughed gently, and winked to the others:"
"“We _are_ a trifle early, Dukes, I am afraid,” said he, going up to the"
dignified old man--“but if Mr. Rippley _will_ insist on sitting between
"the reins on the top of the hansom, the cabby drives hard to escape the"
"inquisitive attention of the police--a body of men, Dukes, that live"
feverishly anxious to catch something and are bored with the greyness
of the popular virtue.”
He tapped the old man on the shirt-front.
"The butler bowed stiffly, and withdrew."
Fluffy Reubens strode airily into the middle of the room and surveyed
it:
"“I say,” said he--“portrait painting seems to pay, eh?”"
Lovegood coughed:
"“H’m--n’yes,” he grunted; and added tragically: “When you can paint"
portraits.”
"“Get out!” said Fluffy, and flung himself into an easy-chair."
Rippley strolled round the room and tested the electric lights; his
hands itching to be at any devilment:
“Oho!” said he--“so the curtain is to go up to-night and discover the
real Anthony Bickersteth--the man of mystery--the writer of _the_
book!... I suppose it ain’t Pangbutt himself!”

_CHIC AND THE REVOLUTION_
“I understand hating bad kings and conquerors; but artists! What harm do
they do?” said Laura.
“Artists are always doing harm to the whole of humanity. They have
"invented an esthetic system for the use of the rich, and they have"
killed the Revolution. The _chic_ put an end to the Revolution. And
"now everything is coming back; enthusiasm for the aristocracy, for the"
Church; the cult of kings. People look backward and the Revolutionary
movement is paralysed. The people that irritate me most are those
"esthetes of the Ruskin school, for whom everything is religious: having"
"money, buying jewels, blowing one’s nose... everything is religious."
"Vulgar creatures, lackeys that they are!”"
"“My brother is a demagogue,” said Laura ironically."
"“Yes,” added Kennedy; “he doesn’t like categories.”"
“But each thing has its value whether he likes it or not.”
"“I do not deny different values, or even categories. There are things of"
"great value in life; some natural, like youth, beauty, strength;"
"others more artificial, like money, social position; but this idea of"
"distinction, of aristocratic fineness, is a farce. It is a literary"

"“Thank you, sir,” said Unity Blake."
Even in those three words her accent was unmistakably cockney--as
"unmistakably cockney as the coarse-featured, snub-nosed, common little"
"face. In happier, freer conditions she would have done her skimpy hair"
"up in patent curlers and worn a hat with a purple feather, and joined"
heartily in the raucous merriment of her comrades at the pickle-factory.
"Here, however, she was lying, poor little devil, thought Risca, warped"
"from childhood by the ascetic ideal, and wrecked body and spirit by"
unutterable cruelty. In her eyes flickered the patient apprehension of
the ill-treated dog.
"“I hope you will soon get better,” he said, with sickening knowledge of"
that which lay hidden beneath the rough bedclothes.
"“Yes, sir,” said Unity."
"“It 's chiefly her nerves now,” said the matron. “She hollers out of"
"nights, so she can't be put into the dormitory.”"
“Do you like the things I send you?” asked John.
"“Yes, sir.”"
“Is there anything special you'd like to have?”
"“No, sir.”"
But he caught a certain wistfulness in her glance.

These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands
"of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or"
cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on
"the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,"
"rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic"
"animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,"
"some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird"
"with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in"
themselves.
The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs
"for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In"

"The coach was fairly full of people, returning from market. On these"

“Bosh!”
"“Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it, eh?” said"
"Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair."
"Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the situation"
with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:
"“And a rippin’ dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one’s self being wrangled"
about from one end of the country to the other----”
Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:
"“Ah!” said he, “and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful"
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!”
Rippley laughed drily:
"“No, no, Aubrey, old man--that wouldn’t have suited you at all. You"
wouldn’t have lasted at it for a fortnight.”
Lovegood smiled:
"“We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,” he said in"
his big deep voice: “We shall be tearing him to pieces in magazine
articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the lower journalism
to snarl at before the year is out.... The failures are always
suspicious of popularity.”

ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS
"In general, a noun or a substantive phrase should be selected for the"
"heading, but when an adjective forms part of a name or well-known"
"term, the entry should include it: e.g., _Alimentary canal, hereditary"
"genius, perpetual motion_, etc."
SUBJECT-MATTER
It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing subject-matter
"as definitely as has already been done with names, places, etc. The"
judgment of the indexer and his analytical skill will be called fully
"into play. The effort should be to express in the index, in the"
"clearest yet briefest form, the _idea_ which the author has amplified"
"in his text. As an aid to the nature and form of the entries, a page of"
"text is shown on the opposite page, and the entries which would appear"
"in the index from this page, are given below. This is what would be"
considered as a medium full index:
"Bressani, Joseph, tortured by Iroquois, 73; life spared by Iroquois,"
"73; sent to Fort Orange, 73; ransomed by Dutch, 73; sent to Rochelle,"
73.
"Dutch, the, ransom Bressani, 73."
"Indian Torture, See _Torture, Indian_."

"life, 73."

"Magnesium Sulphate, etc."
"CATHARTIC SIMPLE.--A medicine that is more active then a laxative, but"
is accompanied by some griping; it causes active peristalsis and larger
"and softer stools than laxatives, as Rhubarb, Aloes, etc."
"CAUSTIC.--A medicine or agent used to destroy living tissue, as Caustic"
"Potash, Silver Nitrate, etc."
"CAUTERY.--An agent used to sear or burn living tissue, with a cautery or"
"a caustic, as a hot iron or Nitric Acid, etc."
CAUTERY ACTUAL.--A metal instrument heated by an electric current or by
"flame, used to destroy bone or muscular tissue or for producing"
"counter-irritation, much preferred to setons in diseases of the bones"
"especially of their joints, as in Bone Spavin, Ringbone, etc., also"
valuable in the treatment of sprained tendons. The methods used are
either puncture or line firing.

CHAPTER XV
THE JOURNEY HOME--THE FISHING AND WORKING OF THE KALOMA SHELL
I
The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by following exactly
the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu. In each inhabited
"island, in every village, where a halt had previously been made,"
"they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of Sanaroa,"
"in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited. Some"
"Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the talo'i"
gifts from those intermediate partners are also collected on the
return journey. In each of these villages people are eager to hear
about the reception which the uvalaku party have received in Dobu;
"the yield in valuables is discussed, and comparisons are drawn between"
the present occasion and previous records.
"No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there"
would be very little indeed to say about the return journey but for
two important incidents; the fishing for spondylus shell (kaloma)
"in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the display and comparison of the yield of"
Kula valuables on Muwa beach.
COPYRIGHT
On the reverse of the title-page is ordinarily placed the copyright
"notice of the volume,[46] usually a little above the center, set in"
"caps and small caps, or in small caps alone. At the foot of this same"
page the printer usually places his imprint.[47]
DEDICATION
"The dedication is a page set in the monumental style, generally in"
"small capitals. This must always be a right-hand page, and the reverse"
must always be blank.
PREFACE
Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size of type as the body. If
"it is written by some one other than the author, it is frequently set"
in italic to mark the distinction. This is particularly true in case
the book contains an introduction as well. If the preface is of unusual
"importance, it is sometimes customary to have it set in type one size"
"larger than the body, or double-leaded."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the preface and before the list of illustrations comes the
"contents, occupying whatever number of pages may be necessary. The"
style of its composition is dependent entirely upon the subject-matter
and the typographical arrangement of the volume.
"Bilkins entered with the tray, wishing us a happy new year. Outside the"
"whistles were beginning to blow. After we had pledged each other, and"
"drunk to 1919, the Mater, a light of challenge in her eyes, looked at me"
and gave another toast:
"""To a cruise and an adventure, Jack!"""
"""To romance,"" Dad cried, gallantly raising her fingers to his lips."
"There was no use being a wet blanket, so with a laugh I said:"
"""To adventure and romance!--Mater, if they're still on earth I'll bring"
"them home to you!"""
"I knew it was a very silly toast, but let it go to please them--for why"
disillusion those who believe in the actuality of nonexistence?
CHAPTER II
THE MYSTERIOUS MONSIEUR
"Ten days later Tommy and I--and Bilkins, whom I had begged of my father"
"at the eleventh hour--stepped off the train at Miami, stretched our arms"
"and breathed deep breaths of balmy air. Gates, his ruddy face an augury"
"of good cheer, was there to meet us, and as he started off well laden"
"with a portion of our bags, Tommy whispered:"
"""Reminds me of the old chap in that picture 'The Fisherman's Daughter'!"""
"DILUENT.--A medicine that dilutes the secretions of organs, as Magnesium"

"reference under name: e.g., _Cartier, description of houses at"
Montreal_.
Enter congresses of several nations under the name of the place
"of meeting (as that usually gives them their name), with"
"cross-references from the nations taking part in them, and from"
"any name by which they are popularly known: e.g., the _Congress"
"of London, of Paris, of Verona, International Peace Congress"
at the Hague_.
"Enter treaties under the name of each of the contracting parties,"
"with a cross-reference from the name of the place of negotiation,"
"when the treaty is commonly called by that name, and from any"

"The second assistant was galvanized into activity, and upon a screen"
before him there appeared a view as though he were looking directly

that flying horde flared into violet splendor upon the screen as it was
"caught in the mighty, roving beam of one of the twelve ultra-light"
projectors under test.
"""Upper lights and lookout plates--all x,"" the second assistant reported,"
and other assistants came to attention as the check-out went on.
"""Lower lights and lookout plates!"""
"""All x,"" was the report, after each of the twelve ultra-lights of the"

recess of the dark depths of the bottom well of the berth and throwing
the picture upon another screen in lurid violet relief.

JAPANESE CHARACTER
_To the Editor of the_ OUTLOOK
"SIR,--I have received during the last few weeks letters bearing such"
eloquent testimony to the nobility of Japanese character that I am
sending you some extracts in the hope of your publishing them. The
"letters are from a friend of mine, who with her husband has lived in"
"Yokohama for many years, and can therefore speak with considerable"
authority. The first extract is about the soldiers themselves--
"Mine you know is a busy life, and I found work among the military"
"were so, why should we make the least objection? But in the hypothesis"
that the introduction of civilisation has in view neither amelioration
"of the condition of the natives nor progress of commerce and industry,"
we might then conceive a sort of suspicion. Supposing that you augment
"the garrisons, the fortifications, the naval forces, one would see in it"
nothing but an expansion of your military power and not an introduction
of civilisation in the sense understood in France. Even in that case we
"would not raise objections, unless it were done with a view to menace"
us; but here I shall offer you a suggestion. Is it really worth your
while to develop there incessantly your military and naval forces in
order to oppose Japan? Would not the enterprise be rather costly? Would
it not be infinitely better to employ your energy in cultivating a good
understanding between your country and ours instead of rivalling each
other by crossing armaments?

OF THE BLOSSOMING OF THE TREE OF LIFE
CHAPTER LXXXVII
_Which has to do with the Binding of Books in Half-calf and the
Whimsies of Calf Love_
"When Noll had left his baggage in a quiet hotel by the Strand, and"
had refreshed his body with much splashing of himself in water and a
"change of clothes, he sallied out into the streets of London in a vague"
"wonder and surprise as to how to begin the search for Betty, yet firmly"
determined to start straightway in his quest--the Baddlesmere jaw set
firm.
"The summer afternoon was closing in, and the Strand was gay with"
people cheerily making their way homewards from work or amusement. But
homewards Noll did not take his steps; he felt a certain sense of shame
"about going to his own people without Betty at his side--and this, too,"
"not on his own account, but that it seemed disloyal to Betty and likely"
to make her future entrance into the family circle an embarrassment to

it has notable antiseptic and antipyretic effects. Useful in carbolic
"acid poisoning, alcohol, or alcoholic liquors, act as a chemical"
antidote besides overcoming the shock produced by the acid. It may also
be used locally for carbolic acid burns.
The effects of alcohol are noticed in ten or fifteen minutes after
"administration and will be shown by a better condition of the pulse, the"
"weak pulse becoming stronger and firmer; the quick pulse slower, the"
"breathing becomes more natural, eyes brighten up and in fact a general"
improvement is shown.
Externally alcohol is used alone as a strengthening application to weak
"tendons and muscles; or after a race, is used to rub on the legs,"
"combined with other drugs as a liniment, as alcohol, soap-liniment and"
witch hazel; can be used in surgery as an antiseptic.
To toughen the skin of tender or thin skinned horses who gall or chafe
"easily under the collar and saddle, alcohol will be found a most"
satisfactory application.

"The thickened juice of the leaves of Aloe vera, Linn., Aloe chinensis,"
"Bak., and probably other species, evaporated to dryness."
HABITAT.--The Barbadoes Island.
"PROPERTIES.--In hard masses, orange, brown, opaque, translucent on the"

PHENOL--ACIDUM CARBOLICUM--CARBOLIC ACID
DERIVATION.--Obtained from crude carbolic acid by agitation with caustic
"soda, heating to 338° F., and adding hydrochloric acid. Then by"
"agitation with sodium chloride, digestion with calcium chloride, and"
distillation at a temperature between 336° F. and 374° F. and finally by
crystallization.
PROPERTIES.--Phenol in its pure state is a solid at ordinary
"temperatures, crystallizing in minute plates or long rhomboidal needles,"
"white or colorless, of a peculiar odor recalling that of creosote, and"
an acrid burning taste. It is likely to be colored pinkish or brown
under the influence of light and air. Soluble in about 19.6 parts of
"water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, glycerin, fixed"
USES.--Tartar emetic is too mild as an emetic in poison cases. In asthma
of dogs it may be used in from ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ grain doses to relax spasm
and promote secretion. For horses its most valuable use is to expel the
"common round worms from the intestines, for which it is very"
efficacious; given in two drachm doses once or twice daily in the feed
"for four to six days, or one-half ounce dissolved in water is given on"
an empty stomach followed by a full dose of linseed oil.

"antiseptic, cardiac depressant; it reduces temperature very quickly,"
usually within half an hour and the effects continue two or more hours.
"It can be administered by the mouth, hypodermically or intertracheally;"
"as an antiseptic it diminishes oxidation, and promotes heat loss by"
"dilating the cutaneous vessels, but more probably by depressing the"
activity of the calorifacient centers.
"""There is no skepticism so offensive as that which doubts the facts of"
honest and careful observation; no Infidelity so gross as that which
"disbelieves the deductions of competent and unbiased judgments.""--David"
"Page, ""Man,"" etc., Edinburgh, 1867."

Don't mind Harry Henry.
She's mourning her dead husband.
I was not betting on seeing you again.
Your persistence is incomparable.
"Yeah, I'm the jerk."
What's in the box?
"Well, ever since Marshall and Lily got their own place, his mom keeps sending them boxes of his old stuff she's trying to get rid of."
"(LAUGHS) Thanks, Mom."
You really nailed it this time.
"I really needed He-Man's right arm, and this old book of mad libs."

What do you think of it?

She's not breathing.
Her neck feels broken.

Everybody okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."

Getraer's gonna have a field day with you.
I'm gonna give you a bath.

Come on.
Give me a hug.
Attaboy.
"Hey, Francis, I baked you a rhubarb pie."

Oh!
"Okay, Dirty Harry, we got you covered."
I don't like Teacher Gil Da Ran touching my files.
I'll look through them and move them myself!
Well since...
Teacher Na doesn't like Teacher Gil touching them...
Just leave them and go.
Da Ran!
Da Ran!

Why is she being like that?
She seems to be having trouble with Yoon Jae...
"It's your doctor, say hello Jae Young."
-Hello!
"-Hello, doctor."
Hello...
"Hello, doctor!"
"Hello, doctor."
Have you eaten?
Why is everyone being like this?
I'm sure they have the wrong person...
"Oh, Jesus!"
Seo Yoon Jae?
Oh my gosh!
I almost lost it back there.
Ah!
"Seriously, again?"
!
Jesus!
"Seo Yoon Jae, this guy..."
He seems like a star around here...
Like this...?
Like this?
Is this how he does it?
"Ernest, I need you to help me here, man."
"Listen, what about the kids in this neighborhood, huh?"
Damn.
They took my radio and my bass.
What's going on?

This is your initiation.
You want to be a Golden Lord?
Then get him.

Where's he at?
"What, y'all just gonna stand around here looking stupid?"
Split up.
"Come on, Dre, he ain't stupid enough to hide in there."
"You see something over there, Squirrel?"
Nobody.
"All right, Golden Lords, move out."
"Come on, move out and check every corner."
"Move out, Golden Lords!"
Watch it.
Watch it.
I got you.
"I got you, OK?"
All right.
Let's...
Easy.

"Hold on, hold on, just a minute."
You in Cleveland?
-That's right.

90-X ten-ton stress chains?

The Army gets their chains from a little firm right outside of Cleveland-

-Parma?
-Little town... yes.
Name of the firm is Morton Stamp  Company.
Get on the ball.
What are you holding up those...?
-Look alive out there!

Mrs. McKenzie.
No. it isn't.

I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn´t your problem, and it still isn´t."

It's the right kind.
"Camel hair, right?"
Thank you.
Did you get a new journal?

My horse died.
Pie-O-My?
That's too bad.

I can't talk about it now.
"What do you mean, you can't talk about it now?"
"Four days already, you can't talk about it."
"Yeah, and you don't understand."
"I can't do it anymore, Frank."
You understand?
Why can't you do it anymore?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?
-It's over.
-Come dance.

What are you talkin' about?
"Bravo, Nicko."

"Oh, God."
"Dale, what's your 20?"

"I wanted you so much, I couldn't see straight."
I have to make sure you know that.
"Rose, it wasn't YOU."
No!
"It wasn't you, Rose."
You're a very... a very sexy girl.
"And... and I know that it's unfair of me to say, now you're with Alex, but..."
"Who said I... who said that I am, I was with Alex?"
Your mother.
My mother?
"Oh, great."
"Oh, Greg!"
I'm not with Alex.

"I appreciate that, man, I really do."
"I don't expect gratitude, man."
I expect you to have the money.
"Go home, Conner."
I got this.
What about your beauty rest?

I'll meet you in the church.
- Are you going alone?

I must keep my promise.
Weng won't hurt me.
I still deserve some respect.
"Sidney, I don't need the money."
I do need your friendship.

I followed him to 6 Horizon Drive.
I almost got him.
I know.
I could have... got him.

"Chang, don't worry."
Eddie.
You can't win all the time.
"But you can't lose forever, either."
Chang...
Chang...
"Inspector Li, did he give us anything?"
Go ask him yourself!
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, what is it?"
Why is it so dark this morning?
It'sjust a cloudy day.
"Relax, it'll be all right."
- Are we leaving today?
- Yes.
Freeze!
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.

"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
There it is!
"It'll soon be a steak, poor ostrich."
Let's scare it off.
-With what?
With these.
Here it comes...
We'll make you run for your feathers.
Senna.
The firefighters said that a cigar started the fire.
I don't buy it.
It was an accident.
Let me make you feel better.
Think.
-No.
"Please, think."
All grown-ups suck.
-Right.
Let me at least hold you.
"I'm hurting, Jemina."
Jemina speaking.
-What are you doing there?
Taking care of this fool.
-Good.
I want to talk to him.
-He's sleeping.
Taisto is in the hospital.
He's about to die.
It's high time to come see him.
I'll come right away.
"-Not you, honey."
"Calm down, Mom."
I've got an idea.
I know.
"- Well, we got 'em."
- Yeap.
- Yours look awesome on you.
"- Yea, so did yours."
"Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day."
Are we cool?
Yea.
Course.
Precious.
"Hey, you hungry or anything?"
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
"Yea, screw food."
I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.
It's my Dad.
Really?
"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."
See you Daze!
Hey Dad.
April?
"Are you... uhm, April?"
Hi.
Hi.
I was a friend of your father's.

Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Erica!
Unh!
Over here.
"Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.
Hello?
Over here.
"Quickly, Sheriff!"
The air lock is closing.
"Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding..."
"Hey, Mom, can we have some tokens?"
Watch where you're going!
Sorry.
"...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
What a spaceport!
"Good work, Woody."
"Mom, can I play Black Hole?"
"Please, please, please?"
-Andy!
"-Now, we need to find a ship"

Hyperactive hyperdrive.
And Astro... turf!

That's it.
Spaceship!
"All right, Buzz, get ready."
And...
-And the universe explodes!
"-Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket."
Buzz!
That's what you're looking for?
Understanding?
"Tell it to someone else, 'cause she ain't listening."
"She is listening, believe me."
She's listening.
Mamá...
"Eddie is still fucking every woman he can get his hands on, except now, he has given them all his money too."

They finally gave my two moms one name.
"But by then, Dad was already done."
"Andi was the one left there to keep her secret, to keep her safe."
And I did.
A pocketful of posies
And sometimes it was great.
We all fall down

"Hey, girl."
I thought you were going to Star City.
"I am, tonight."
"You bad 'cause you got a camera, huh?"
"Come on, show us."
You're messing up my picture with your lousy dancing.

That's real good.
You know you're always welcome here.
Bobby's about to blow out the candles on his birthday cake.
"How old are you, 60?"

What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
You want the neighbors to see me?

"Oh, I'm so..."
What kind of tea do you want?

I've just been talking to a friend of yours.
- I've got the probation report.
- Where are you?
Right around the corner.
Meet me at Franklin and Hudson.
Schwartz?
- George.
- Abe called me.
He's in the back.
That's the only way in.
The back door's gated.
All right.
I got a couple marriages.
Abe.
It's your play!
Throw the card for me.
You've been practicing all your life.
"Freddie, give us a minute."
He's dead!
Schwartz is dead.
I heard it on the phone.
I was...
Get ahold of yourself.
It's okay.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
That's when I got burned.
It's four months ago now.
I left four years ago.
"- Hi, Mum."
- So you're back?
"- Yes, I am."
- And you'll stay?
- Yes.
- You can't stay here.
I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?

"How you doing, Beaver?"
Uh...
They're cool.
"Well, come on in."
Come on in.
Go ahead.

"That's Joey, and the whining one there on the couch is Kim."
She had a couple teeth yanked out.
"Fuck you, Beaver."
Why don't you grab yourself a chair?
(SNORTING)
You want to sit down?
"No, that's all right."
I'm fine.
"So, where's this multitude of coke?"
Where's Billy?
He ain't here.
"I can see that, but where is he?"
"Well, he's still in New Orleans."
PLUTO:

"- No, it really isn't."
"Classic he said, she said."
"Okay, Jess, just pull over right here."

Get the hell out of here!
Don't ya know people are trying to sleep!
Yeah!
Pipe down!
You had enough?
"Have you seen what I""ve turned her into?"
So it would be easier to be with me?
I love you.
"I love you, Lisa."
- Might as well dance.
- I suppose.
"Bobbi, where is he?"
Where is David?
"Clara, you know I can""t tell you that."
"Clara, I want you to go home and wait for me to call you."
Thank you.

You don't have to say it.
You don't have to say it.
It's okay.
"It's okay, babe."
It's okay.
Okay.
I'm so glad you came.
I'm so glad you...
"Oh, babe."
What were you doing here anyway?
She's breathing.
Go get help.
Do you remember the Rileys?
You guys stayed with them when you were about 10 or so.
"Yeah, they had a cabin up by Mount Lutsen."
Yeah.
"Eric used to call Sonia ""Gammy."""
- Grammy.
- Grammy.
Whatever.
Maybe he went there.
Maybe.
They were really good with you when things were bad.
They

- Remember?
"- Yeah, in Grand Rapids."
- At Grand Rapids.
- I cut my finger.
"Yeah, with a hook."
"Eric caught this great, big old smelly fish."
"He acted like he found gold, for God's sakes."
"- He'll be okay, Mom."
- I know.
I should pack.
- Is that John?
- No.
"It's work, but guess what."
He asked me to marry him.
Really?
"Well, he didn't really mean it."
"I mean, it was"
When the times comes....
"I used to travel a lot, too."
I was a young idiot.
I know you...sit down.
I know you traveling' men.
"I was, too."
"Oh, sure."
I've been everyplace.
I speak six language.
-No kiddin'.
"-Oh, yes, sure."
"Go get the wine, huh?"
"Ah, language."
Watch this.
You know what that is?
What?
"You know what it means, that?"
No.
"I know, you never make fun of a man talk funny."
I talk English better than she talk Greek.
"You know, Frank, this-a country there's no there's no...ideas here."
"Opportunity, oh yes."
There is no happiness.
"Frank, Frank come here!"

Do you know where Ryan is?
He's getting in on the 10:30 Ferry.
Wants you to pick him up.
He called.
I guess you were busy.
Got it.
Oh baby.
What's all this?
"Come on, I'll drive."
...just the fact that Jim gave me the case.
"I mean there are five other guys he could've given it to, but, he handed it to me."
Hi baby.
Miranda is insanely jealous.
What's in your pocket?
You haven't listened to a word I've said have you?
"Yeah, five guys..."
Miranda's insanely jealous.
What's in the pocket?
Open it.
It's your mother's old silver chain.
"Ryan, it's beautiful."
- Oh.
Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.
- Okay.
All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.

He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
Oh.

I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.

"But it's not that simple, is it?"
"I mean, it might turn out to be... brownish."
"Oh, right."
And is Moz racist?
No.
"That's not the point, is it?"
It's just... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm comin'!
"'Ey, that's what got you into trouble in the first place."
- Hiya.
Is Moz in?
- He's off hunter-gathering.
He's out gettin' some cigs.
- Can I wait for him?
- Who are you?
Craig.
Friends call me Craigie.
Moz calls me Craigie.
I've got a delivery for him.
Really good gear.
He's been asking us to come round for ages.
- Shall I spark up a doobie?
- I suppose that's the least you could do.
Yeah.
- You haven't got a beer?
"- I have, yeah."
"- You two lesbos, then?"
- What?
- I'm bi.
She's bi-curious.
What?
I don't know.
"Ah, now, Jesus..."
"- No, I do know."
- Well?
I'm not telling.
"Now, look..."
"Jesus, do you hear that?"
Gobshite!
"Now, don't start that."
Just tell us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
"- I just can't, right?"
"- Well, is he married?"
"No, he's not."
"Well, that's something I suppose."
"Ah, Kay..."
"Jesus, stop it, will you?"
"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.
"Go on, get in there."
Go.
Get in.
Go on.
Will he marry you?
"No, I don't think so."
"Ooh, the Iouser."
"That's cheatin', that is."
- It's not a game.
"- I know that, Kay."
"I mean, it's his fault as much as Sharon's... isn't it, whoever he is."
Everybody leaves.
"First, my father."
"Monk, don't do this now."
"- Then, Trudy."
Trudy didn't leave you.
Sharona.
"Now, Dr. Kroger..."
I can't blame Natalie for leaving.
"I'd leave me, too, if I had the chance."
"God, I am the king of Garfunkel."
I am oozing Garfunkel.
"She'll be back, Monk."
She just needs time to cool off.
That's right.
She probably feels worse than you do.
She looks pretty happy to me.
"Oh, would you just turn it off?"
Please.
It's just...
It's too painful.
"No, no."
Wait.
Did she just say 15?
I've got four numbers here.
Our next number is 33. 3-3.
"So nice, they named it twice."
Oh.
- My God.
"God, I can't stand it anymore."
All right...
And our final number for $212 million is... 54.
54.
The next departure will be Los Angeles to Chicago.
"Help you, sir?"
"Change, sir."
Sir!

-You're welcome.
"-I've got 'em all, what do you want?"
-You want one?
"Okay, new shooter comin' into the game."
"All right, guys, four."

Right.
You got it.
What about you?
Dollar here.
"Okay, roll 'em."
Come on.
Don't touch this money.
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.
"-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night."
"-Honey, gimme some money."
"Come on, we're gettin' lucky."
These guys don't know craps from wheat or somethin'.
Come on!
"No, I'm not giving it to you."
What?
"No, you don't understand."
This is your last chance.
Get out with your hands up.
Here he comes.
He drives like a cop.
Pull up to him.
"Come on, fellas, easy."
My leg!
Something's wrong with my leg.
- Where's Dad?
"- Tommy, listen..."
"He's been shot, Tommy."
The killer got away.
Daddy!
Jesus Christ!
Look who's here.
"- Tommy, sorry about your father."
"- Thanks, Don."
You just couldn't stay away.
Why come to the sentencing?
We've already heard your testimony.
- Uncle Nick.
"- Hi, Tommy."
- How are you feeling?
- I don't know.
- How's the leg?
- Okay.
- I don't want to be here.
- You're a better man than I am.
"Tommy, they got the guy that killed your father."
- What is this?
- His name's Kesser.
He couldn't even lift those women.
Because this sleeping in all day till you go to work at night is not gonna fly on my day off.
- Okay?
"- Look, can I just sleep right now?"
Honey?
What?
You okay?
I'm...
Yeah.
I'm tired.
Okay.
"Handcuffs might seem like overkill, but they're going on."
"They're going on, okay?"
You have the right to remain...
- This is a stupid law.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"Hey, Twister."
Eddie?
"Daddy didn't let you out, huh?"
Good boy.
I am sure...
Ed.
"Jeez, it's almost 2:00."
Are you kidding me?
You didn't feed Twister.
You didn't let him out.
Peed all over the floor.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 2.
"I don't care if you don't wanna eat, but the dog's gotta eat."
- Wow.
Okay.
"- All right, get up."

MAC:
Heh-heh.
Harry. listen to this.
I have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a condo conversion.
"If I play my cards right. my 2000 could turn into $20,000 by Christmas."

Okay. fine.

Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!
"-Oh, make it stop!"
-I am trying!
Get the ball.
Ready?
Get the ball!
"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
"Don't worry, my doll."
Don't cry.
Forget about it.
"No, grandma."
I don't want to forget.
"Wake up, Maria."
Get up already.
Get up!
What's the matter?
- I'm leaving.
"- So soon, Quico?"
When are your parents coming for you?
I don't know.
Did you ask grandma?
"- Bye, Maria."
"- Bye, Quico."
"Don't step on the lines, Barbuda."
"Goodness, Maria!"
I don't know if I'll make it.
"Look, the cotton candy man."
Spin it around.
This one.
- We have a winner.
- Two reais.
- It's cheaper in the circus.
- Life is expensive these days.
I want a piece of this cloud.
"Look at the seagulls, Maria!"
Can we shoo them away?
- Want to get your feet wet?
- Yeah.
I've missed you so much!
Wait.
This guy's Ollie?
They fucking talk about Ollie all the time.
I thought they made him up.
What?
"It's always like, ""we went to the zoo with Ollie."
"We built a fort with Ollie."""
"""Yeah, okay."""
Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
Thanks for the beverage!
Man on PA:
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."
"Oh, shoot."
I'm in it now.
We've been open six months and had not one customer.
"You don't think it's -- it ain't my dancing, is it?"
"Yes, it is your dancing."
Show me your shapes.
"Oh, I got a ton."
"Here, check this out."
Hot Dog.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Hot Dog.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Igloo.
Those are not enough shapes!
No one will wash their car here because of you!
I got more shapes.
"I mean, come on."
I know all sorts of shapes.
I better go home and practice me some shapes.
"Yes, you will!"
You better go!
You better go!
"Okay, here we go."
Here comes a chair.
Close enough.
What are you doing Meatwad?
Come here.
Get out of there.
- Move.
"- What's happening, baby?"
"- Where you been, huh?"
- I've been in there.
- Can you stand a toss?
- Sure.
I'm clean.
- You use shit?
"- No, man."
"Oh, man, who are you, Dick Tracy or somebody?"
I said I was clean.
"- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?"
- No.
I said I'm clean.
"- If I do, you know what happens, don't you?"
- Yeah.
I said I'm clean.
"Aw, motherfucker, don't-"
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass.
Fuck you.
- [Indistinct]
"- Oh, yeah, in where?"
- Gimme a nickel.
"- Come on, man."
Gimme a nickel.
Come on.
Come on!
I told you I'm clean.
Why the fuck you wanna come down on me like that for?
- Get your ass in there.
Charlie's taking care of it.
"Come on, come on!"
"Dale, Dale..."
Dale!
CHARLIE:
"This is 2-11 to base, 2-11 to base."
I need an ambulance out here on Sulphur Springs road right away.
That son of a bitch nailed him.
Yeah.
Dale?
"Hey, man, hey."
Hang in there.
I've got an ambulance on the way.
"I'm going to run in the house and get you some blankets, okay?"
"Are you dead, mister?"
Hmm?
"Are you dead, mister?"
"No, not quite."
Where's the lady at?
She's over there.
"Don't go away, come back."
Come back here and stay with me.
Yeah.
Just stay here with me.
How did you get the blood on yourself?
I got in a fight.
(GROANING)
What do you do with your keys?
Oh...
I lock things up.
Come here.
I can't see your face.
-He's fine.
Look.
Here's your ball!
Get your ball!
Get your ball!
Get..
Of course.
You don't want a tennis ball.
Not when you can have a meatball.
"Come on, get the meatball."
"God, what have I done to you?"
"I broke the dog, Pheebs!"
I broke the dog!
Thanks.
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?
"Oh, I got big Valentine's plans."
"I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy."
"Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.."
We actually watched the documentary together.
"Oh, my Chinese food."
I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are..?
Hi!
How are you?
I'm supposed to pick you up.
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!
-Oh!
"Hey, Mona!"
"-Hi, Rachel."
- It w... it was terrible!
- Yes.
- They took my wallet and my skates and my tie.
- No.
What... what homeless person needs a tie?
"Oh, my God."
"I am so sorry, Mitchell!"
"Okay, um..."
Can you give me my phone?
"'Cause I got to, you know, cancel my cards."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Oh, God."
I hope you have juice.
That thing has been buzzing like crazy.
"- Oh, God!"
Okay.
- Okay.
My meeting's been pushed up.
It's in 15 minutes.
"Okay, okay."
"Okay, okay."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Look at me.
Look at me.
- Huh?
Yeah.
"- Hey, hey."
"This is a test, and we don't sweat the small stuff."
- Just let it go.
- Stop it!
Stop it.
"I know you think you discovered the new you, but you are controlling even when you're trying to not be controlling."

Huh?
Search for the hero relic we just found again?
What a pain!
No thanks.
"Why is it that everywhere we go, things always become a giant pain?"
"Yeesh, this really sucks."
"""The legend continues..."""
Open it or he dies.
Open it.
- Open it.
Get out here.
Get out here.
Tell him to come out here.
- Tell him.
"- Do what he says, Dennis."
- Thanks.
- Unh.
"Unh, please, don't do this."
"- No, thank you."
- How 'bout some organic fuel?
- That freak juice?
- Pass.
Whoo!
Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
"Nah, not me, Flo."
I'm on one of them there special diets.
I'm a precisional instrument of speed and aero-matics.
"""You race like you fix roads. """
I'll show him.
I will show him!
"Oh, great!"
I hate it!
"- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!"
- Music.
Sweet music.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
"Radiator Springs, a happy place!"
"OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?"
Great!
I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!
Wow.
"Mornin', Sally!"
"Hey, look at this here fancy new road that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!"
Yes!
"Uh, amazing!"
Whoa-ho!
Yeah!
"Oh, Ramone!"
"She's scared, but she's all right."
"Listen, Nina--"
"End the damn call, Lisa."
Hang up now.
"( gunshot, people scream )"
"Oh, my God."
( Charlie gasping )
( group gasps )
Help me sit him up.
DR PENZLER:
It's all right.
Come on.
- There you go.
"- Oh, my God."
CHARLIE:
Cellophane.
- What?
- Cellophane.
Cellophane.
Somebody find some cellophane somewhere.
"All right, he's got it."
Get it off.
I've got a scarf!
I've got a scarf!
Where are you going?
"I'm getting my scarf because you shot him, Ray!"
"Ray, Charlie is really hurt."
We've gotta get him to a hospital.
"I guess I wasn't that much help to you after all, was I?"
"This doesn't have to get any worse, Ray."
"Everything gets worse, Dr Penzler."
Every stinking thing in this world.
- Oh!
"- Okay, all right."
"Time to go, time to go."
- Okay.
Horace:
Let's go.
"- Okay, I'm going."
- Let's go.
"- Hey, wait, wait, wait."
Where's my twenty?
- Look under Pete's watch.
- Holy shit.
- All right.
That's enough.
- Fucking scumbag!
What the-- Horace:
That's enough of your shit.
"Let's go, goodbye."
"- What the fuck was that, huh?"
- Yeah.
Mary Ann: (quietly) Iâm just gonna go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm-
"- See my sister, I told you."
- Why are you going there?
- Iâm just gonna go to my sister's house.
I can go where I want.
"- No, you're not."
"- I don't need your permission, Horace."
"- No, you're not."
- You have no right to keep me here like a fucking prisoner.
"Just let me go, please."
- Talkative.
- Mm-hmm.
- Rambling.
Is that a problem?
People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.
Helps compensate for the fear.
"- Masks it, too."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.
The voices make you feel less alone.
Even though you are alone.
"You aren't scaring me, Katie."
Pity.
Is there like a refrigerator here?
There's some snacks in the cupboard.
Alrighty.
"Eenie meenie, miney..."
Mo!
Alright.
"Okay, ginger snaps."
Let's see.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
This'll do.
Now... um...
"He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?"
"Yeah, that's how this works."
Knew it.
Jump scares get pretty old...
Fuck!
"Oh, God."
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?
- Is my brother going to die?
"- No, he is not!"
"No, he is not!"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.
I need to clear an airway.
- You got a pen?
- What?
A pen?
Do you have a pen on you?
Here we go.
Come on!
All right.
Come on.
"Breathe, damn it!"
"All right, here we go."
Come here.
Help me out.
"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.
I got him.
- What do you got?
- A 12-year-old trapped in a culvert.
Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."
-Nice.
-There you go.
Is it nice?
.
Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!
-Buy load instead!
Thank you Migs!
-Joy!
Stay here first.
-What happened?
-We'll take care of that.
"-Migs, wake up!"
It's too low.
-Why did you come inside?
-Alex please!
What is that?
I hear balloons.
"I'm actually, uh..."
I'm doing birthday parties now.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
"- Well, that's good."
"- Yeah, yeah, it is good."
"So, okay, uh, take Meemaw to the doctor, got it, and I'll do a good job of that."
"I won't let you down, okay?"
I promise.
"- Thank you, Chip."
"- Thank you, Mom."
"Where are you, by the way?"
- I gotta go.
- You outta town?
Mom?
- You doin' okay?
- Hi.
"- Hey, Mom, what's goin 'on?"
"How are you, Cody?"
All is well.
"How are you, Mom?"
- Where's Logan?
"- Uh, he's sleeping."
"Oh, God, he always was a sleeper."
"- Man, you know that."
"- You have a lot of energy, more than him."
[Chuckling]
"Um, I have a little surprise."
Please share.
"What is it, what is it?"
- Yes Sir!
Got a big shadow though!
She's the biggest woman in Japan.
Here's name's Amelian.
- Amelian!
- Yes Sir!
Beat him up!
Don't pull me!
Stay away from me...
I've got B.O.!
I'm getting dizzy.
Please let me go!
Let me down!
What a B.O.!
You still want Amelian?
No...!
I wouldn't dare...!
Give me the money!
"Some more, don't you try to fool me!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
I won't tell you.
Amelian has been again!
I can't hear your death bells ringing!
"You wouldn't tell the lady, I'll get you a man!"
Hiroshima!
Why is it taking so long?
Have you got it yet?
In a second!
Soon!
It is hot!
It's time!
"Let me do the introductions,"
No!
"Uh, maybe..."
"uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...!"
Mm.
I like this one.
Ugh!
"You think you do, but you don't."
What do I think of this wine?
Great question.
Here's what you think.
"Hey, Ethan."
How's Rudy?
How's Beanbag?
"Uh, they're great."
Beanbag's great.
Rudy's such a delight.
I just dropped off some juice for them.
Can I get a cranberry juice?
Uh-oh...
Coming right up.
"Um, who's Rudy?"
- He's my son.
- You have a son?
"Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability."
"So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"So, your face is saying one thing..."
No.
No.
I love kids.
Okay.
That's so not you.
Why'd you do it?
Because you didn't say goodbye.
"Goodbye, Rory."
"Bye, Jess."
- Great.
I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.
- You thought ahead.
Smart.
The mirror.
Yeah.
I never leave home without all the essentials:
"Mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy."
- I'm done.
Do you want to use it?
- Thanks.
- Don't I look charming?
- You look great.
I looked better.
I had to run here straight from work.
Kinko's.
"Hey, Liza."
That gets me thinking.
Maybe you and I ought to do a little reproducing after the ceremony.
- Clever.
- Don't be a snot.
Shut up.
"- That's my boyfriend, Zach."
- Sure.
We're breaking up'cause we're transferring to different schools.
He's going to Florida State.
I'm going to UMass.
I just have no idea what element goes there.
"Okay, Michelangelo, but we have to close our eyes to match the photo."
So you're the timekeeper.
Well- (SCOFFS)
"Yeah, dude, it's 7:59."
Just go ahead.
"Well, how long do we do it for?"
"10, 15 seconds?"
I'll tell you when to stop.
Just go.
(EXHALES)
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.
Sweet.
Threesome.
"(SCOFFS) Come here, asshole."
(GASPS) Oh!
Of course.
"Oh, geez, did you guys-"
Hey!
(GASPS)
(DOOR SLAMS) Shit.

- Go get Jasper.
I just wanted to- Go get Jasper!
"- Finn, I'm sorry."
- Who is this?
That's my bookie.
Ivan.
The guy you're always talking on the phone to?
What is he doing in the apartment?
- I don't know.
- Is that normal?
Unique.
This is one view that's been shown over a thousand times.
But each time the effect is amazing.
- Hi Ankita.

"Yes, Miss Zeynab."
"Zeynab, come here, this gentleman needs milk."
It's so dark here.
is anyone here?
Come in.
Can you milk the cow for me?
"Wait, I'll do it."
It's so dark.
How can you milk in here?
I'm used to it. I work here.
You'll get used to it if you stay.
I'll be gone before I get used to it.
We have a flashlight.
The electricity is off.
"""lf you come ho my house..."""

"Hello, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
"Come on, Nick."
"Come on, Nick."
"Nick, wake up."
We'll know for sure after we see the tests.
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.
"Can I have the book, please?"
Thanks.
"All he knows, it went dark."
"If he'd have turned around, Frank, they'd have hanged us for it."
"And something, something put that cop there."
"It's an act of God, those lights went out."
Don't look back.
-What?
-Don't look back.
It's a cop.
-His red light's on.
"-Oh, God."
"No, no, leave 'em on."
Bathroom upstairs?
"Ah, yeah."
What's the ladder doin' there?
I don't know.
"Hey, come here."
All right.
Sure.
I hope it's a girl.
Relax!
Calm down!
Calm down!
"Stop screaming, you'll waste your strength."
"Push, come on!"
"My god, it's a boy!"
Look how pretty he is.
It's a boy!
"Here it is, the macarroni."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Look.
Febo!
Febo!
Febo!
"I have to admit, I've never been there."
You knew I'd be here.
Are we even?
- Come with me to Capri.
- No.
I believe in my marriage.
Though...
"Febo, Palm..."
Did you find the dogs?
Not yet.
It's my fault.
"- You're a good person, Captain."
"- No more than you are, Mrs. Wyatt."
"What's this about ""net weight in the morning""?"
What does it mean?
"I insisted on that, sir."
Scientifically... the morning is when the human body weighs the least.
This is ESPN Classic.
They play all old games.
So the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
"1986, the finals, game seven."
You remember watching this?
You were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
I remember.
I was so swollen.
I hated Detroit.
"- Isiah, Laimbeer."
- Yeah.
Dumars.
"Oh, my..."
"But Worthy, James Worthy, he saved us."
He shot the lights out.
So fantastic.
You know that thing I was trying to talk to you about?
- Jimmy.
"- No, I'm just saying that I took care of it."
- I knew you would.
- You did?
I can't believe I'm old enough to have watched people play in those shorts.
"Hey, Marissa."
Marissa?
I'll go.
Here you go.
Hey.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Come on.
You can tell me.
- He's okay with this one.
You have a case.
- Druse.
Again?
- Mama.
"- Hush up, Bobby."
This could be serious.
I've got pins and needles all up my right arm.
There.
Isn't it lovely?
Ready?
"And one, two, three, up."
"Sweatpants, no pockets."
We can't do a wallet biopsy on this one.
I know who he is.
- You want me to guess?
Is there a prize?
- I can't get air in him.
- I know.
- Really?
Want to share?
His name's Peter Rickman.
He lives in Castleview.
He's a famous artist.
"Liz, could I get an 18-gauge needle, please?"
"No syringe, just the needle."
- Are you...
- Yes.
"Tension pneumo, Elmer."
Pleural sac is inflating like a beach ball.
Time for a party trick.
May I be excused?
"Working title ""Old Maids of Margate"""
It's Southend.
"Twenty one, Lily sweet Rose spunky."
Rose gets the boyfriend.
"My darling, I couldn't die without saying,"
"""The cornflower blow in your eyes the final time."" You can have that on me."
What's his name?
The boyfriend.
Eric.
Eric Lum.
Do you hear that noise?
That's 200 women in 1 in 9 never allowed to call their sons anything as bloody feeble as Eric.
Give me hero's name?
Jon.
Dull.
Johnnie.
Hm..hmm.
They left him to make it back.
Injured.
Oh!
This.
A rescue!
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there!
Hear!
Saved a smiling Officer.
Hm.
Fellow soldier...saves the dog.
But he didn't!
"In real life, he didn't."
Films!
Mrs.Cole.
"And now, the situation in portugal -"
"Nice, huh?"
"What,s wrong?"
"- I,m afraid."
Why?
What is it?
"I don,t know."
"Sweetie pie, what,s wrong?"
Are you okay?
This is science.
"It,s not -"
"I don,t know."
That woman -
Have you seen my pills?
"Aren,t they on the table?"
"You know, I really feel awful."
What are they doing?
"CIaudine,s feeling down."
"She,s crying."
Jean-MicheI is comforting her.
"They,re such a pain!"
",I,m always the one who brings up breakfast.,"
Time for our little show.
"It,s ready, ma,am."
"3, 2, 1 ."
Be happy.
Love one another.
"We,re creating this city for you."
To make you happy.
"Be happy, but not too happy."
"Too happy and you,d have nothing to wish for."
"- What,s this crap?"
Let me just finish.
My skin is way lighter than yours.
Okay.
Just wait.
You'll see.
I just have to do your whole face first.
-What are
- Where are you going?
- I don't have to come in till 2:00.
"- Oh, see you at 2:00 then."
- Okay.
Seeya.
Guy at 1:00.
Not cute.
Say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- That doesn't match your skin color.
- I know.
It doesn't.
"Do you want me to finish, or do you want me to leave it how it is?"
Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.
I'm 18.
She's 17.
- I turn 18 next week.
It's not such a bad thing to keep a man waiting.
You don't want him to think he's the only date you've had in years.
- It's not a date!
- Give me the bow.
Where's the bow?
"Hey, your mother did you up again."
"Looks terrific, Miss Morgan."
- Thank you.
- Want me to get you a cab?
"- No, I'm fine."
- All right.
"Ooh, good."
Sir!
Sorry.
Hello!
Are you sure about this?
You're going to take me?
"- Get in, lady."
- Thanks.
"Here's where I'm going, but don't go until I put up the window."
"- They're broke, lady."

What about me?
Why can't I get it up?

I sure hope he gets his...
"Right on a nice, sharp curve..."
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts!
Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.

You're all dressed up.
Yeah.
We're in the money.
I filed the claim.
We're rich

"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.

Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!

We would expect you to cook all the meals.

I'm very good at sleep-training and I'm an excellent cook.
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've gotta tell someone."
I can't keep it to myself any longer!
- Every time I go out in that yard...
- What do you mean?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!

I buried him in the sheep pen!
"Selena, you've gotta call the state police."
No.
"No, I can't!"
You've got to.
You should've done it long ago!
Please don't make me!

Then you come home and get waited on.
Are you kidding now?
"Sure, I laugh all day long."
"And you cry too, right?"
What would you know?
Where's our mom?

Where is she?
Fine.

I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.
Lukas will be alive.
"I'll make you both breakfast, put out your clothes."
"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.
Elias...
It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?
She's lying.
Let her prove she's our mom.
What am I doing?
What's Lukas doing?
But I can't see him!
What's he doing?

"When they finally got pregnant, they seemed so..."
"So happy, I know."
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for coming with me today."
"Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to see Violet, and this gives us a chance to hang out."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Things have been a little awkward, you know?"
"Well, no."
"It's just, uh..."
It's nice to see you... outside of the office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Mnh-mnh.
Apparently... there's a closet situation.
Violet.
"Hey, it's me."
"Uh, Nai and I are outside."
Okay.
Hello?
Vi?
"Could you... could you shut the front door, please?"
And... and lock it.
Both locks.
It's closed and locked.
Okay.
"Hey, you guys."
Hi.
It's so good to see you.
Hi.

Put that down!
"No, come on, come on!"
"Jess, wait!"
"Let's just talk about this, okay?"
Hold on.
"No, that's mine."
You can't take that!
"Jess, hold up."
What are you doing?
I got it!
"It's really heavy, but I got it!"
"Oh, my God, we created a monster."

It has my name on it.

"Jess, don't..."
"- Come on, everybody out now."
- Give me my shirt!
- I like this shirt.
"Hey, Jess, no, no, no, stop."

We're just here for the TV.

-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.
I know.
Did you like them?
Yeah.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
"Well, they were friends."
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.
I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.

-Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
-Blood pH 7.37.
-Thank God for small miracles.
-How's the patient?
-He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
-What's his temp?
-Eighty-five degrees.
-He's not warming up enough.
-Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
-That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
-You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.
"Lily, go get Benton."

The masked killer that you most scared at will appear to-night.
Huang...you want to hit me?
No.
I was trying to get this mosquito.
Don't be afraid...
Let me teach him a lesson.
Ward me off!
Kick me!
How?
A kick below the belt!
You've kicked at the wrong place.
It's you!
"You're right, it's me!"
Want me to be a eunuch?
Here!
Come again!
Come up here!
Running away?
"Master Y an, Master Fan's body is over there"
He deserved it
Who brought it in?
I don't know
We just stepped into the house
And saw that Master Fan is lying here!
Ask that old fart to come out
Someone has already been sent
What's happening?
"Master, there is a body there!"
Come here!
"Master, they've asked you to go there."
Coming!
Hurry up!
So it's Master Fan.
You deserve it!
A word more and I'll cut out your tongue!
It's true.
That's what is written
Gao Jian!
Shi Zhengzong!
"Y es, Master Y an"
Who killed Fan San?
I'm sick.
Been in the store room all the time
Yes.
Let's go
"Here, have a cup."
Sure.
Cheers!
Cheers!
I have quite a few pretty girls.
Do you want to try them out?
There's no hurry.
I'll take my time.
"Yes, sure"
"By the way, What urgent matters do your boss have?"
He used to handpick the slaves himself.
The Governor of Hyeon-To is at BuYeo
My Lord
A problem?
-Is it for real?
-Yes.
-Let's get started.
-Yes.
Hey
"Aigoo, I need help!"
"Come, come!"
Brother.
Not here!
Put down your swords.
"Long time no see, Your Highness."
I never dreamed of seeing you in a place like this.
"You used to act like you own everything,"
Now look where you are.
"You're a lucky man, Commander."
A fortune just came knocking on our door.
"I was in the blouse, too!"
"She was there, too."
I see.
That's all right.
"You aren't hurt, are you?"
"I'll tell you, if I'm hurt."
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?
What misbehaviour is this!
Go away!
Just go away...!
Don't forget!
I own the place!
And you owe me the rent!
And you're driving me out!
Don't misunderstand me!
What do they consider guests to be in India?
They're called guests!
Yes.
That's right!
Yes!
Guests are like God!
Yes.
You're right!
"So, what is it?"
I've got to know your secret.
Really?
What secret?
You're not a dance assistant alone.
Joseph and I share the secret now.
Then I'll hold it.
What do you see?
I sense something else.
A picture?
His?
He's not wearing much.
"He's not into the sex industry, I hope?"
No.
I see him on the beach waves and...
What's up?
What did you see?
"I drifted off, I think."
"His name was there, letters."
"H and E, HENK..."
HERBERT...
HERMAN
Herman!
"Gee, I didn't know you were so good at it."
Look... ls that him?
Well now...
You're going to tell me all about this Herman.
I've known Herman for years.
From when I first met Johan.
Johan?
Who's this Johan?
- My dead husband I told you about.
"- Oh, yes."
"Herman wanted me, but I married Johan."
That's life.
Sure.
But tell me about this Herman?
I'd rather not.
If she comes looking for me and sees you then we got the screaming problem again.
"So, for now, would you, you know, just..."
"Just stay here, okay?"
I'll come back tomorrow.
(METAL CLANKING)
Wow.
"Well, goodbye."
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"No, no."
Me go.
You stay.
No following.
Good.
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
I told you!
I'll come back tomorrow!
"Now, stay!"
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
HOGARTH:
"No, no, no!"
Bad robot!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"Look, you can't go stomping around and you can't come with me."
My mom will wig out.
- (LAUGHING)
- That's right.
"So you have got to stay in the forest, and I'll bring you some food tomorrow."
But I gotta go home now.
"So, goodbye."
(CLANKING)
Hmm...
Hey.
CLARE:
Dad... (GRUNTING) (INCOHERENT CHATTERING)
CLARE:
He's been hit.
STONEBRIDGE:
"No his back, his back."
CLARE:
"Ugh, get him higher."
Get him higher.
STONEBRIDGE: (GRUNTING) Jacoub get the fuck out of here.
CLARE:
"All right, Dad?"
CLARE:
"It's all right, Dad."
"Just, just relax for me Dad, okay?"
I'm here.
(YELLING IN ARABIC)
(GUNSHOTS FIRED)
It feels wet.
"Wet, like I'm drowning..."
"I know, just relax."
I can's feel an exit wound.
Shit.
"Crawford, I need you to give me the name of Latif's spy."
You saved your daughter's life.
"You have her, now tell me his name."
Are you interrogating him?
"Yes, I am!"
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up...
And there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it!
It could end up being a hit.
We'll see.
Step by step.
"Yes, step by step."
So...
"Good night, Yitzhak."
Good night.
Get up.
Daddy.
What's wrong?
- Why didn't you get up?
What time is it?
Five after ten.
I gave you the alarm clock.
I forgot to set it.
"We're late, that's not good."
"No, it's not."
Get up.
Good morning.
"Please tell Alex we're running a bit late, we'll be right there, I just can't get a cab."
"It's Goni, Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel's daughter, I'm sorry."
Yes.
"Okay, then don't bother Alex about it."
"Okay, we'll be right there."
What are you doing?
I have to take my pills.
Come on!
Would you please hurry up?
I'm almost ready.
All I need is my shoes.
Alex.
Goni.
Did I just say hung?
Hang.
Let's hang each other!
Sure.
We could go to Eddie's tonight.
"Sparkle, I'll see you there!"
Cool!
[cackling]
"What up, fam?"
"I was all, like, ""Yo, babe, you and me, tonight."""
"She was all, like, ""Oh, my God!"
"I've loved you forever, I'm so excited you asked me!"""
"You nailed it, now all you have to do is get through the actual date."
"Oh, God!"
Emma's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
So Clark likes Emma.
Who knew?
Me.
I know all the office secrets.
You don't know all the office secrets.
"Oh, really?"
What don't I know?
Is it about Clark?
Emma?
Jack?
It's about Jack.
[stammering]:
I didn't say that.
Didn't need to.
Jack and...
"Happy Birthday, Linda!"
"Oh, it is my birthday..."
"Don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here."
Yay!
And then I'm gonna eat you.
No...!
Shush!
Where is she?
She should be out there by now!
Who's that?
I don't know... it's too early for Ethan to come back.
Aah!
I'm not decent!
Come back later!
Thank you!
I must use the kerplunker!
There's a line for the other one.
Make it fast.
"Don't tell me, make it fast."
Just go.
"Don't tell me, just go."
Just da... ah...
Make some noise.
Sing songs or something.
"Look, look..."
look at the legs on the glass.
You see the legs?
I see fe... it looks like feet.
"Oh, Linda."
"You're such a sweet, simple person."
Thanks.
"Wait, what?"
It costs a lot to have our children slaughtered in the streets.
Coming through.
"Step back, please."
How's he doing?
Just coming out of surgery.
- Coming through.
- Give them room.
Step back.
All the way.
Where's the widow?
She's not a widow yet.
You'll introduce me.
"Combat Cross, Medal for Merit Honorable Mention, Department Medal of Honor."
- Any kids?
- Two.
Five and three.
A boy and a girl.
Wife's name is Elaine.
Elaine Santos.
Which one is she?
Don't point.
In the red.
The other's the sister.
I'm John Pappas.
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.
If there's anything we can do...
- Which one was the shooter?
- They're both shooters.
"One's dead, one's almost."
We know the dealer.
Tino Zapatti.
We'll get you out.
They can't keep you in prison.
"Kinda watch out for my mothe r, will you?"
"How tough are you, babe?"
[MEN CLAMORING]

"Hey, Limpy"
Come here.

"[SOFTLY] Yes, sir."
"Oh, just for a visit, boys ."
Just for a visit.
"Why, you flap your ears and wish you was a swallow."
"Murder, second degree."
He's doing life.

All of you!

"Yeah, I'm always in a good mood."
Like when?
Like always.
Like the night you were born.

Okay.
Off you go to school.
"Bye, darling."
I love you so much.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.
"See you later, alligator."
"- Good morning, Christine."
- Good morning.
"Good morning, ladies."
What's wrong?
You're smiling.
What do you mean?
I always smile.
No.
No you don't.
"No, it's something else."
Wait a minute-- did you have sex?
"Marly, I think you're right."
"Look, her neck muscles have relaxed and she's not doing that crazy thing with her eyes."
Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.
When did you get a boyfriend?
"You don't need a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
"Oh, yes."
Make some noise.
Sing it!
Let me see those hands.
"Come on, everyone."
You guys sing!
Am I better when I'm naked?
I Iike being free.
"I recorded ""What Makes You beautiful"" in my boxers."
Who gets to go on the O2 stage in their dressing gown?
Not many so 'm gonna live that dream boys.
And 'm gonna go out there and rock me little socks off.
"Thanks, everyone!"
Free hugs.
Free.
"Free hugs, anyone?"
I Iove you.
"You'II give me a hug, won't you?"
Yeah.
Another hug.
And one more?
One more hug?
please.
One more?
please.
The most important thing is not to pull it.
careful!
We've got a bomb.
"Oh, that wasn't-- I did not pull that."
"Three, two, one, go!"
What happened?
I've got no brakes!
I've got no brakes!
Huh?
"You good, B.?"
Yeah.
"Come on, man, let's go."
Come on.
"Come on, we gotta go, we gotta go."
(Club music thumping)
(Cell phone vibrating)
Hello?
Okay.
"Okay, thank you."
He's at Hector's.
It's not me he's running away from.
"17 years, Kike."
I gave my life to you.
"It was hard, but I did it."
I put my trust in you because I knew
You would take care of us.
But now my baby's out there.
"E., I don't know what happened to you up there,"
But it has nothing to do with Michael.
The boy loves you.
He needs you.
We need you.
*
(Knocking)
(Door creaking open)
"(Manny) Hold it, hold it."
"Right there, right there."
I just want my family.
Can I talk to him?
Son.
Sit down.
Talk to each other.
"Hey, Mr Einstein..."
-The cake.
"-Sally, get in here!"
-I was scared.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah.
"You help her, Carlo."
-What is that?
Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those Japs?
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for styangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"- How do you do, madame?"
My name is Louis Bernard.
"We thank you very much, Mr Bernard."
"- That's our son, Hank."
"- Hello, Hank."
Hello.
You talk Arab talk.
A few words.
Why was he angry?
It was an accident.
But the Muslim religion allows for few accidents.
"- Yeah, I suppose so."
- 0h.
- May I?
"- Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo."
"0h, I thought his name was Hank."
"0h, it's my wife's name."
- J-0.
No E.
- How different.
Short for Josephine.
I've called her that so long nobody knows her by any other name.
- l do.
Mommy.
"- 0h, yeah."
"Now, about the accident."
A Muslim woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
They feed her intravenously?
"- No, Hank."
- What a big word for such a small boy.
(Laughs) I'm a doctor.
0h.
"Oh, but this is very important."
"I'm sure it is, and I want to hear all about it."
"Well, I'd like to start from the beginning."
After breakfast.
But this is very important!
"Now, what would you like?"
"How about some oatmeal and a nice big glass of milk, huh?"
That'll build up your strength.
I'll take a look down this way.
"Oh, hello."
Hello.
Do you have a Nancy Collins listed?
Nancy Collins.
Let me see.
"Cooper, Collins, yes."
Drawing Room B. Right in here.
Thanks.
(BELL BUZZING)
Nancy?
Nancy?
Nancy.
(SCREAMS)
"Beg your pardon, I must have the wrong..."
Wrong room.
Excuse me.
That's quite all right.
Oh!
"Oh, why, Gretchen."
What are you doing here?
I drove down with Bob.
He was worried about you.
How nice.
–Where are they?
–They're in the waiting room.
–I gotta see 'em.
–I won't let you.
Not like this.
–Corrine... –I don't want them to be scared.
–They won't be.
Vic.
Daddy!
–Hi.
–Daddy.
I missed you so much.
Kiss.
"Hey, Matty."
Give Daddy a kiss.
"Hey, Vic, I really need you in here now."
"–Dad, don't go again."
"–Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
I have to.
"Listen, someone was hurt really bad... and I have to stay here until he feels better."
"But as soon as I can, I'm gonna come and see you again, okay?"
I promise.
I love you.
–Where is he?
–Who?
Fleetwood.
You're packing his goddamn suitcase.
"Now, where is he?"
–I forget.
–Where's your boyfriend at?
–I don't even hear you.
–He just shot my partner.
- Maybe I just feel insulted.
- Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I'm putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
!
91.
Number 91!
91.
Number 91.
"91, number 9."
"I mean, how hard is that?"
A talking monkey could do her job.
- It's embarrassing.
"- Actually, that's 16."
You're holding it upside down.
It's confusing.
There's usually a little line under the nine.
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.
- I'm pretty sure it's the nine.
- It's no big deal.
- I've seen it my whole life.
- I've never seen it under the six.
Why don't we ask Natalie then?
She's the expert.
"Okay, okay."
But I see your point.
About the monkey.
-Hey.
"Bull, good to see you."
"You too, sir."
So.
"Bull, I guess you've been at the gym pumping things, huh?"
"Yeah, they keep us pretty busy."
I just came back from body-slam class.
Do they grade that pass-fail or is it on a curve?
There's a few things I would like to know--
"-Yeah, like, when's your first match?"
-Next week.
-I've got passes if you're interested.
"-Interested, are you kidding?"
-He wants to know if we're interested.
-Wouldn't miss it.
"-Oh, boy."
MAC:
Ha-ha.
Selma?
I'd rather eat linoleum.
What's with her?
"-Well, she got some bad news."
-What?
Uh-
- The Dodgers left Brooklyn.
"Say, that is bad news."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Well, I gotta get back to work."
"You go get them, tiger."
ICHUCKLESI
ISNORTINGI
"Bull, Bull, Bull."
- I'll be fine.
- You come with me.
You first.
I'm right behind you.
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss.!
"Okay, stay down."
"Oh, you're a lucky girl."
You're a lucky girl.
Just get behind the door there.
Just get right behind the door there.
We will take care of him.
Don't worry.
"Boy, I hope he tries something now."
"Come on, Hammond."
Just give me one reason.
"Way to go, Jack."
Way to go.
"Come on, Hammond!"
You're in a no-win situation!
Put your hands out of the car where I can see them!
"- Stand up, Hammond.!"
Stand up.!
- Get up.!
"Turn around, turn around.!"
Turn around.!
Hands on your head.!
On your head.!
You know the drill.
- You got him?
You got him.
"- We got you now, my friend."
"Dig it, dig it"
"Oh, yeah"
"She's lookin' in your eye, eye"
Why?
I don't know
"Whoa, yeah."
Boy with ringlets.
Man with tattoos.
Girl on... a leash?
"Man, if my parents ever tried putting me in one of those things,"
I'd trade them in.
This kid looks like she can roll over and fetch.
I learn everything I can and I write down everything I see.
Golly says if I want to be a writer then I'd better start now.
Which is why I am a spy.
Lady with a purse.
Man with... her wallet.
"Oh, help!"
Please!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Quack
"Quack, quack"
Quack
"Quack, quack"
And... done.
What is it?
It's Nanomichi.
"You know, the god of storm and thunder."
"- Cool, huh?"
"- Okay, come on, hurry up before it dries."
- Yeah.
"It's true, he freed me."
You dug a hole in the wall.
And I also have a job.
Oh!
What a tall tale!
"""If you think the night is nice, the day will be worse. """
Balla is a liar.
I'm not crazy.
Believe me!
Balla is a joker.
It's been a long time.
Haven't seen you around lately.
Is it ready?
Yes.
Let's celebrate the reunion.
Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
This is to make amends.
Around 7 grand.
I'll see you out.
"Thanks, Leo."
I won't forget.
"The guy you're looking for, Dragan."
I know where he is.
At a chick's place on Borrego St.
Don't ask how I know.
Police!
Freeze!
Stay there!
Get up!
Let me hug my kid.
Your wrists!
Sign there.
"Have a nice leave, Silien."
Your Puch's in the toolbox.
"With a 2nd clip, just in case."
"This is dumb, Silien."
You got 3 weeks to do.
Watch the road.
Neat vodka.
You kept Dragan to yourself.
Was that wrong?
"Don't they say, it takes two to tango?"
We're not dancing anymore.
"Anyway, he was a bum lead."
How do you know?
I know.
That's all.
Silien here.
Who is it?
"It's Bobby, Marco."
Bobby?
"Yeah, I got to get something from you."
What I tell you about coming by here so late?
"I got to get something from you tonight, man."
Bobby...
"Come on in here, man."
RAY:
This is a pretty woman you got here.
Look at those little titties.
"Ray, what are you doing?"
"Hey, man!"
I got everything you want on that table over there.
There's 200 bucks in the wallet.
There's some coke in the kitchen.
Take the money and the coke.
You know what this is?
This is lighter fluid.
RAY:
"Fuck you, man."
I don't want no $200.
"Stop it, man."
"Put it out, man."
Put it out.
I'll tell you where the shit is.
(SCREAMING)
"Fuck you, man!"
Motherfucker.
"Oh, goddamn."
Goddamn.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Not red.
"Ok, bye."
Hey.
Sounds like we got here just in time.
"How can we help, maid of honor?"
I am so late.
Talk to Seven.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
Hello.
"3... 2, 1."
My keys.
Thank you.
"3... 2, 1."
And the picture.
"Oh, thanks."
I'm gonna follow her.
Make sure she makes it all the way to the elevator and out the front door.
Today's the big day!
"Ok, so the funny thing about pantyhose is, there isn't a... tag."
How do you tell which way...
is the front?
You really can't with these things.
Hi.
Is there a beautiful bride in here?
"Oh, look at you."
Nice suit.
"Oh, shut up."
You're the one who looks beautiful.
It's your day.
Gosh.
"Becca, what the hell are you doing?"
Vegas.
I could leave Detroit.
Run things from out here.
Put a little space between Marcus and I.
What for?
Is he hurting you?
No.
Not yet.
It's complicated.
Alright.
Then what is Taylor asking for?
Four million.
It's a drop in the bucket for a guy like Marcus.
I think he wants me to fail.
Why?
I almost died in Berlin.
Blade.
I got burned.
I think Marcus lost faith in me.
All he needs is an excuse to replace me.
Then he's a goddamn fool.
Lisa?
Lisa.
I called the house but nobody's there.
Nobody's answering.
Is the nurse there?
Lisa?
You chill to the bone.
Do you wanna go to the hospital?
"Alright, alright..."
"Well, let me take you home."
I don't want to go back there.
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right. lt's all right. lt's okay.
"-Go, go..."
-Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
(breathing heavily)
-Did we do it?
-l think so.
-Will I die?
"-No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
(GRUNTlNG)
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Oh!
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
(dialing)
-MAN:
Somerset Textiles.
"This is going to be great, he'll get such a kick from this."
"Good stuff, Dermot."
Are you ready and settled?
Yeah.
Sid?
Yeah.
"Hi, Sid, how are you?"
"All right, yeah."
"I know we haven't met, I'm Dermot."
"Good, good."
You're the new lad?
I am.
"I'm Dermot, how are you?"
Good.
Good to meet you.
Yeah.
It's your last day.
Is it?
Yeah.
"No, it's not."
"No, shall I..."
"You're leaving, aren't you?"
You what?
"You're leaving and Sleet said I've got to sort of like, you know, just give you a surprise and give you presents for your daughter."
"Well, I'm not..."
There we go.
Wonderful.
"OK, then he's written some words for you."
"Yeah, go on."
"Yeah, this'll be good."
What?
Go on.
-Hey!
Hey!
How're you doin' that?
-Stop that.
-Back!
"Back, you savages!"
Back!
"-Woody, stop it!"
"-Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!"
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home.
"Another stunt like that, cowboy, you're gonna get us killed."
Don't tell me what to do.
Yee-haw!
"Giddyap, pardner!"
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!
Split up!
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
"Come in, Buzz Lightyear."

Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off."
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me.
"Mr. Monk, come on."
It's one night.
"Well, then"
I'll guess i'll just have to say no...
Kay.
No kay.
No kay.
Which is it?
"""No"" or ""okay?"""
Nokay.
Noookay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever gonna get.
No kay.
- Nokay.

Nokay.
- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
Got it?
"- Well, yes, but..."
- But what?
Well...
"- Hello, Mac."
"- Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?"
"No, not at all."
Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.
"Pleased to meet you, Sullivan."
I know all about you.
You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
"- A room at my old neighborhood on Dock Street, number 24."
"Well, I'll blow now."
"I'll drop up, say, Monday?"
- Monday?
That'll be fine.

I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
"- See you later, Jim."
Monday.
Get me Steve.
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...
"Your Sharon, like?"
Yeah.
"Gas, isn't it?"
But she's not married.
I know that.
Who did the damage?
We don't know.
She won't tell us.
"You'd want to find out, wouldn't you?"
"Excuse me, compadre."
What's it to you who it was?
I couldn't give a shite who it was.
"I'm not gonna buy the food, the nappies... or the little bleedin' track suits."
Dessie is!
I am in me hole!
Hang on a sec.
"Maybe I will, what?"
"Ah, so what?"
I don't care.
It's only a baby.
"Snapper, what?"
Compadre...
I can let you have some very good baby clothes.
Mucho goodo stuff.
Benetton.
- Ha ha!
Benetton.

"Sorry, lads."
Will you take a few of these raffle tickets off me?
What for?
This.
- Mm-hmm.
"- Well, see you after lunch."
"- Right, Bob."
Later.
"- You're going down, right?"
"- Oh, yeah."
Down.
No place to eat up there.
"Why don't I, just press the button again?"
"- Oh, thanks, Bob."
See you soon.
- Right.
Later.
See you then.
"Uh, this elevator's broken."
You'll have to use that one.
"Well, that's about it for me, Bob."
"I'll be, moving along now."
- Right.
- Right.
"Hey, Bob?"
What are you doing for lunch?
"I'm doing it, Jerry."
Where are you going?
I'd better not tell.
I don't think you want to know.
Go ahead Jerry.
It won't bother me.
"Well, I'm going to a new smorgasbord place:"
Mr. Bulk.
They got all-you-can-eat for an hour.
- That's it.
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.
Good.
All right.
Now all you gotta do is just think warm thoughts.
You gotta think Hawaii and you gotta think the Sahara Desert.
You gotta think about....
Come here!
Come on!
You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!
"You gotta stay awake for me, all right?"
Okay.
All right?
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.
Why don't we just sing a song.
"- You know songs, don't you?"
- No.
"All right, yeah."
Yeah.
"How about ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""?"
"All right, listen."
Come here.
I've gotta get some help.
- No!
Don't go.
Don't!
- It's okay.
"Please, don't."
"You gotta sing as loud as you can, so I can hear you."
All right?
You mentioned something about apartments.
I'm going to need one of those.
Open-ended.
- He's a fighter.
- Good.
"Okay, Ron, it's time to beat the chair and win $10,000."

"For $10,000... who starred in the suspense thriller Three Days of the Condor?"
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.

Dustin Hoffman?
"I'm sorry, Ron."
Robert Redford.
What a sport.
This is all your fault.
"If it wasn't for you, Charlie..."
Somebody in here?
This is so wasted.
"Bobby, isn't it a beautiful morning?"
You promised you'd stop.
"Never again, you said."
This is where I work.
"Yes, but this time, I think I really am ill."
"Still now, Mrs. Druse."
Still as a mouse.
But please pay no mind to it.
Please give me the knife.
--Here you go...

Only the graph paper.
--Aleksandr Ivanovich Ermakov --Move away please
Alright
"See, Sasha."
"He'll sign the permission, I'll go get Nastya, and all will be well."
You already brought one here.
That's quite enough.
Shame on you.
What are you doing?
I'm not the one who has the explaining to do.
Dale's son--explain that.
Explain cancer.
Explain war.
Explain the whole damn thing to me just one time... so I can understand why everything has to be so hard.
"( sobs ) Oh, God."
I'm sorry I hurt him.
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
Allie...
LISA:

"What are you doing, Allie?"
Charlie...

"Look at me, Dad."
He's all right?
What do you think we ought to do now?

( cell phone rings )
"Yes, Ray?"
"Heiio, Ray?"
No.
This is Allie.
We're all going to come out of the building now.
Please tell everybody not to shoot.
I'll go with you.
All right.
They're coming down.
She says she'll come with us if we let the others go.
Everybody set?
- Mary...you can't do this.
She'll pick you up later.
Don't go!
Maria!
Where are you?
"Hold on, Quico."
Come back already!
Now you can blow out the candles.
Should I make a wish first?
"Sure, my darling."
Help!
Get me away from here!
Well done.
Let's eat the cake now.
Doesn't your doll get a piece?
She doesn't know how to eat.
You never talk to me.
- Talk about what?
- Anything.
"I put together this huge party for you, yet you don't say a word to me."
Tell me what's on your mind.
- When?
- Now.
Where is my mom?
Where is my dad?
What?
Where are my mom and dad?
- Time for your presents!
"- Tell me, grandma."
"What, darling?"
Where are my mom and dad?
I told you already.
They left you with me.
What else?
-Scotch.
-Nice.
-Red wine.
-Okay.
-Now we can eat.
"-Some white, too."
Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
"You got to go on a diet, Vinnie."
Read 'em and weep.
What are you doing?
"Alright, I'll catch you guys later."
"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.
-ls there any more?
"-Nope, that's it."
Have a good weekend.
Thanks Henry.
You girls stay right here.
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.
What are you talking about?
I saw her name on the register.
Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
1986.
The finals.
Game Seven.
You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.
She is really talented.
Turn this off!
"Hey, turn it off!"
I cannot believe you!
That's the girl that
I am dating!
How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?
!
"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.
"Your photos, your movies, your website... it's all blocked."
Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.
Ben?
What are you doing here?
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.
Open the door.
Wrong door.
"Wrong door, Connor."
C'mon.
I'm trying.
Hurry.
Just hold it right there.
"Yeah, he's young."
"He's not tall, but he's young."
Philip.
"Philip, get over here."
"No, now, as quick as you can."
Get here now.
"So there was these two old men sitting in deck chairs on the beach, and one of them turns to the other and he says, ""It's nice out today,"""
"and the other one says, ""Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."""
(LAUGHTER)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hey, let's hope it's a boy!"
Huh?
Philip!
"Come on, stand up."
"Oh, you are standing. (LAUGHS)"
"Come in, come in."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh!
In you come.
(WHISPERS) We will be social with these women tonight.
"Son, you're young."
Come on.
Huh?
What are you?
- Old.
- Yeah?
Wise.
"And also rich, which helps."
"Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich."
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
"Dads, dads, dads!"
You call me that if you want to call anybody dads!
"You're my kid, see?"
Joey!
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
"You'll get that into your head right now, or-"
"Please, don't!"
"Don't, Joe!"
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here-
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
"Here's your medal, Kid."
"I can't now, I'm too busy."
I'll keep it for you.
"Well, we got a croaker."
Always come in handy in our family
"- Eh, kid?"
Huh?
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Wake up, kid."
"Come on, Come on, kid."
We got to walk in in style.
Oh-oh!
Honey child!
He's back!
"Oh, my darling's back!"
My boy!
Look behind you!
"The giant, it's attacking!"
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
- Sweet mother of God.
- MANSLEY:
"Look, damn you!"
(ENGINE ROARING)
I am not a gun.
"Hey, Mom."
(ROARS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Let's get out of here!
Run!
(GASPS)
Hey.
Stop!
There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."
Go to code red.
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
"- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends."
- Mm.
"All right, roast beef, turkey."
What do you want?
"Oh, let's do the works."
Pile it high.
"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.
You were there?
Yep.
"You know, before I touched down here, I moved around a lot."
"New Orleans, New York, Chicago."
Been here the longest.
Ah!
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Ahh.
Yo?
I'm stripes.
That's right.
What?
You're kidding me.
"No, no, I can't switch shifts with you."
I've been drinking.
"Oh, you could tell?"
All right.
"All right, thank you very much."
All right.
"I've never seen anything like that, Tyler."
That's all I'm saying.
"Well, you're right."
It was insane.
"All right, Cory."
"Tony, please?"
Just keep 'em coming.
"You know, I could be wrong,"
But I think they call that self-medicating.
I'm a trained professional.
"- I'll have what he's having, Tony."
Whoa!
Yes.
Oh!
Ah-ha-ha!
Bleah!
Oh!
Wow.
What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.
This place?
"Yeah, imagine."
"Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here."
"You know, I don't get you."
How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?
"Well, it's really pretty simple."
"I was an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and..."
"Oh, you were, were you?"
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
"Yeah, OK."
"Well, that was my life."
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah.
I mean... really?
Yeah.
So I left California.
Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.
"Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in."
"Well, they all did."
My sister?
Danielle.
"You mentioned her earlier, no?"
- No.
- Oh.
"It must have been Simon, then."
He talks about you a lot.
Thanks for the dance.
Anytime.

I'm warning you.
Let this go.
I have it under control.
There you are.
Sorry.
I-I think I had too many mojitos.
I just... needed to lie down.
"Well, I hope tonight wasn't a complete waste."
Did you at least manage to have some fun?
"- I mean, Blanca's great."
- Mm.
"And Hector's, uh..."
He's an acquired taste.
What did you and Blanca talk about?
Honestly... you.
She said she'd never seen you so happy.
She's right.
I've never met a woman like you... ever.
And I don't think I ever will again.
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Painted Face is back!
I'm scared!
- Get rid of him!
- OK.
"Foon, it was a good idea to come back!"
She's back in my arms again.
"Old pal, let's impress her one more time."
Watch this!

"- Yeah, I just tripped."
"Foon, you're overacting."

You've been holding my hand the whole night!
Are you crazy?
I'm going crazy!
I've been possessed by a demon!
Exorcism is my forte.
Where's the ghost?
Where's the ghost?
"- Say, if my wife answers, don't tell her."
- I won't.
- I'm getting this as a surprise for the family.
- I'm wise.
- Wait till you meet.
I got the cutest wife and kid you ever saw.
So long.
"Congratulations, Joe."
"Good luck, kid."
Good luck.
Congratulations.
I'm glad to see you get it.
Best to you.
"- Hey, Frank."
"Come here and meet out new foreman, Joe Dombrowski."
"- Nice going, Joe."
- Thank you.
He won't feel like going.
Best thing is to leave him alone.
He'll get over it.
"Oh, come on."
At least we can try and help him.
- Come on.
- All right.
"- Hey, anybody home?"
"Hello, Ed."
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Come on.
How about a movie?
"- No, thanks."
- Why don't you and Buddy go?
Where's your scary boyfriend?
Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.
Mind if I join you?
I love heights.
"From up here, it all just seems so much smaller, you know?"

When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."

Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...

"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
- Malakai ?
Are you all right ?
"- Yeah, yeah, man."
Anybody catch one ?
"It ain't over, bitch."
"I don't even know why it started, bitch."
'Cause you always in my way.
I'm only in your way when it comes to Derek.
That's what this is about.
"No, it's about you."
White girls like you.
"Creepin' up, takin' our men."
"The whole world ain't enough, you got to conquer ours too."
"Whatever, Nikki."
"Derek and I like each other, and if you have a problem with that, screw you."

"Um, now is really not a good time to talk."
- Okay.
Well-- - l'll call you.
"Oh, no."
"Here, let me see."
But it's not yours to keep.
Great!
Really great.
And so began our summer with Tetra.
"He lived in my closet like an old friend, ...who'd been there for years."
"Hello, Misaki!"
Hello.
Is Yusuki home?
He's been in his room all morning ...just go on in.
Anybody home?
Whassup...
"How is he, Yusuki?"
I'm so sorry!
You gave me a fright.
Didn't you hear me?
Sorry.
"But boy, you scared me!"
My heart's thumping.
Stuff for Tetra.
Thanks.
Here's the aluminum.
How about this?
Let's ask Tetra!
Choose what you need.
He's so cute!
He likes that.
What's he making?
Dunno.
"But there's lots of parts, ...and he's real quick."
We interrupting?
Don't just barge in.
Your Mom said it was okay.
Reason why should be showing her
Off in public anytime soon.
"OK, bye bye."
Sir.
Sir!
Yes?
You have to pay.
"No, no."
It's OK.
I'm a fireman.
With 62 truck.
We already don't get paid enough
As it is.
And God forbid this store catch
"On fire, I would be the one to"
Run in here and save all of you.
"So, I mean, I think"
The least that you can do is
"Offer me some free food, you"
"Know, as reward."
"OK, and buddy, that comb over,"
It's not fooling anyone.
"Good luck, God bless."
"Good night, new York."
"Hey, what's up, man?"
This your car?
"Yeah, it's cool, right?"
Sorry?
The car.
"It's cool, right?"
You know what color that is?
Copper.
- And what about me?
- And what about me?
- And what about me?
"- And me as well, and me as well..."
The taxi's coming in 15 minutes.
Where's Ricky?
- He's meeting us in Marseille.
- Why?
He wanted to leave before us.
"Okay, Marseille."
"Second-biggest city in France, on the coast of the Mediterranean."
Population:
"About a million and a half, among them 80,000 Jews."
Not bad.
"- And about 300,000 Arabs."
- We're going to Gaza...
"- Hey, Zinedine Zidane grew up in Marseille."
- Who's that?
What's that?
"""L decided to stay."
Waiting for you at Rosa's till you calm down.
"Dad"""
Him and his manipulations.
What a pest.
There's Ricky.

"- Beirut, the restaurant?"
- Yeah?
New owners.
"It's called ""Yizar"""
- and it's a karaoke club.
~ What?
~ Happy birthday.
"Well, I was 40."
Who wants to be 40?
I wouldn't mind.
"Were you there, Mrs Magath?"
'Course.
We were all there.
"Us, Jo, Scottie, Michael."
Michael?
~ Michael Woodruff.
~ Who's he?
Michael and me were Scottie's best friends.
Since we were kids.
Where can we find him?
Organising the bin strike.
"Oh, that Michael Woodruff."
~ Good news for rats.
~ Hm!
"Do you think we could take Jo home, assuming she's identified the body?"
Although it might not be him.
"No, it is him."
You seem to be... ~ What?
"~ Are you suspicious, or something?"
No.
Though I wouldn't mind finding out who took a lump out of your face.
"Oh, this."
"Oh, it's er..."
hijinks at the party.
Michael started smashing chairs over our heads.
Why was that?
Pissed.
Oh.
"Oh, no."
Can this be evil?
Dr. Jekyll.
Dr. Jekyll?
"- What's happening, sir?"
Are you all right?
- What is it?
What do you want?
"Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Now, wait a minute."
"Wait a minute, Poole."
"Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?"
"Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir."
"Yes, Poole?"
"I'm sorry, sir, but I..."
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
"I thought something was happening, sir."
"No, no, no."
"It's quite all right, Poole."
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.
A Mr. Hyde.
I let him out the back door.
"Oh, I see, sir."
"Very good, sir."
"Miss Beatrix is here, sir."
"I showed her into the consulting room, sir."
"I hope I did right, sir."
"Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole."
Tell Miss Beatrix I'll be there immediately.
"Very good, sir."
.
I just got tired earlier.
Would you like me to take you home?
.
"That is if it's okay with you, Bela."
Don't worry about me.
"Come on, I'll take you home."
"Bela is beautiful, isn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, and she's kind."
She's really kind.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Not really but I just didn't know she was your ex.
Come on Joy!
"Joy, Joy..."
Listen to me.
Listen...
"Don't ever think about her, okay?"
She's gone.
"She's past, as in already erased."
It's gone.
And you...
You are my present and my future.
It's only you.
Is that okay?
-What?
Want to go inside?
"-No, I still have duty tomorrow."
-Are you sure?
.
-I might lack sleep.
Go ahead.
- He's in the next room.
- So the chocolate was for him?
- Mel...
- It was a retropharyngeal hematoma.
- What?
I snuck a look at his CT results.
- So he wasn't choked.
- No.
It happened earlier.
Probably from the fall.
I need to go.
My place after shift?
Sure.
Why not?
- I was getting worried.
- I can't do this.
- What?
"Tash, stop..."
"- Griff, just stop."
That's my sponsor.
I texted her.
"- What, you're in the program all of a sudden?"
"- Yeah, I am."
Come on!
I was sober for 8 months
- before you showed up at my door tonight.
"- Tash, listen."
"We can work out the whole stripping thing,"
"I was being an idiot, OK?"
Don't leave!
"If you leave, I'll have nothing."
We have a future.
"Listen, my wife and I are really lost."
"We're trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
"Why don't you buy the map, then I can help you."
Okay.
"Okay, now."
"Your problem is... (MAP RUSTLES) ...is you're way up here, you see that?"
- (DOOR CHIME RINGS)
"- Oh, my God, that is a problem..."
Yeah.
Now what you have to do is you have to take five all the way south toward Salem.
That's right down there.
You see that?
- CUSTOMER:
Hey!
- NEAL:
Okay.
OWNER:
That's where you go.
Got it?
CUSTOMER:

"Oh, God."
- NEAL:
Honey?
"- (EMMA PANTING, GROANING)"
I think...
- Chase.
- Yeah?
I need to talk to you about the baby.
Why don´t you take a few minutes and then meet me in my office?
Mr Milliken?
Mr Milliken?
"Oh, my God."
Mrs Milliken!
Come quickly!
Quickly!
Hey.
How´s the hand?
It´s fine.
How´d Chappelle find out?
I don´t know. lt doesn´t really matter.
What´s going on?
Almeida´ll interrogate Nina.
I´ll follow it from a feed.
Good.
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
"- Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
- Sure.
Thank you.
"Jack, you´re about to find something out about me that´s not gonna make you happy."
- What are you talking about?
- Excuse me.
Do you mind?
I´ve got a daughter.
- A daughter?
- Her mother dropped her off and she split.
- lt´s a long story.
Shit.
"You think you're tough, bitch?"
Keep the ground floor clear.
Package is on the move.
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
We are coming in hot.
"Copy that, sir."
Eagle is 30 seconds from the vault.
"GO, go!"
Mr. President.
Glasses.
Match.
We're in.
Go!
Go ahead.
I'll button this up.
Go ahead.

James William Sawyer.
Gentlemen.
What are you doing?

"Please, Martin, what are you doing?"
"I'm sorry, Ted."
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.
Emily?
"Where are you at, baby?"
Please tell me you got out of here.
Mr. Stenz.
We're in.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello.
"Oh, it's you."
I...
"I'm awful sorry, Skeets, that I didn't talk to you in the lab, but, you see, Aunt Nancy was watching."
"Oh, that's okay, Wilbur."
"Are you going to dance with me tomorrow night, Wilbur?"
"Sure, I'd like that."
You like to dance?
"Oh, gee, I..."
I'd rather dance than eat.
Would you like to see a real good step?
"Oh, I'd love to, Wilbur."
All right.
"Real gone, man."
"Oh, that was nothing."
I could dance a lot better if I had music.
"Hey, wait a minute."
I got a portable radio in my room!
Yeah?
Only it's against the rules for me to leave the switchboard.
(SCATTING)
I'll be right back.
Crazy.
Hello?

-help Me.
Play more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-was Zana.
She was alone in the E6 after the killing.
-Five Miles away?
There is logic?
-Geir Tangen is on the line.
This is not the best time.
-And About Zana ...
-I do not think she was in shoals.
It was a professional as the gunman.
She would not escape.
Or be released.
What if she has been freed before?
-So How she made it to the E6?
She wanted to find her father.
Were you looking for me?
Not here!
You brought your stuff?
The car is there.
Why do you not answer me?
-The Battery is dead.
Kaan?
Take Sinan and get out.
Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this.
What was it?
I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
"Try a little harder, Candan."
Hello?
Candan just left.
Okay.
Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay?
Did you get it?
"Yeah, you wish."
We are screwed.
It's a different bag.
"What do you mean ""a different bag""?"
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her bag?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished.
They're leaving.
How are things with you?
It's not good at all.
Try and delay her.
I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her?
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"It's bedtime, Sheriff."
- You all right to drive?
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?
- Positive.
"- Take it easy, Freddy."
- Take it easy.
[ Radio ] It was not Lady Luck thatJim Maloney found in Atlantic City.
It was the cops.
The 30-year-old native of the Caribbean island of Antigua... was captured in a casino just days after an aspiring rap artist... was fatally beaten in a Queen's convenience store.
Sources have filled in some of the blanks for 1 0 1 0 WINS saying--
Shit!
"[ Music, Chattering ]"
Oh!
All right.
"Take it easy, take it easy."
I apologize.
"Magilla Gorilla, you fucking ape."
"- Mikey, I'm out."
I'm gettin' outta here.
- Where're you goin'?
- I love her.
- Yeah!
Hell of a party!
- Roger.
"- Okay, Superboy."
"You're my man, Superboy."
"- My man, Roger."
- Keep it up.
Nicely done.
That's a good look.
"Don't laugh at me, Drew."
Come on.
What happened to your eye anyway?
My eye's fine.
Just let me...
"Let me have your shirt, please."
What?
Just let me have your shirt.
I'm not gonna give you my shirt.
I can't go in to Gates like this.
You shouldn't have spilled coffee on it then.
"Okay, well, I did."
"And now I need your shirt, please."
Just...
All right.
All right.
Spill anything on your pants?
"You want me to give you those, too?"
Come on.
Stop being like that.
"Hey, everybody, I made it."
Just kidding.
"Big day, huh?"
Everybody pretty excited about it?
"Hey, Allan made it."
Whoa.
"What happened with your eye, bud?"
"Nothing, man."
I'm okay.
Yeah?
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What have you got?
A contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
What?
I don't have a wipe.
Give...
Give me a wipe.
Just...
I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.
"Oh, thank you."
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
My gosh.
There are so many.
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.
Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?
Excuse me.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
I got a little distracted.
"Apart from you, we don't have anyone here."
I don't know. I have exams.
"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
No.
"No, my mom's out of town, and my dad's working late."
You busy?
For you?
Never.
I just want to say that I thought you were great with the Myers.
"Well, they're good people."
I owe them a lot.
Tracy told me that you were the one that introduced them that shelter in Haiti.
People are complicated.
"Well, you maybe."
Not me.
- I think you're complicated.
"- Well, you're wrong."
You just don't understand me.
Where are you headed?
Got a date.
Does that give you a twinge?
No.
Bye.
"Honey, you home?"
Shh!
Okay.
Shh!
"Hi, dad."
"Um, this is my friend Miles."
You think I don't recognize the smell of weed.
Dad.
Get out.
Hey.
What is it?
What do you mean?
"All right, see you then."
"How soon can you get me Operator 19, St. Louis?"
That's my girl.
"Hi, Al."
This is Rip.
"Sure, I'm great."
Did you get my phone message this morning?
Not yet.
Not f or a while.
I got unfinished business down here first.
Somebody who used to be your Detroit competition.
Calls himself Martinelli.
"Yeah, in spades."
Did you dig me up the name of a good man down here?
"McGee, 25 Palmetto Street."
"Okay, pal."
You're a pal.
I'll be seeing you.
"Yeah, when I got aces back to back."
So long.
Lieutenant Kincaid?
Call f or Lieutenant Kincaid.
- Calling Lieutenant--
"- Okay, boy."
Who wants me?
"Headquarters, sir."
On the phone.
"Hello, lieutenant?"
Chief wants to talk to you.
Will you hold the wire?
At last.
You said 1:00.
"It's quiet tonight, huh, Freddy?"
Hmm?
It's quiet.
Everyone's at that bachelor party across the river.
"Oh, yeah."
Whoop-de-doo.
You got any quarters?
"Don't look at me, I just put two more in the meter."
- It's his birthday.
"- [ Figgis ] Oh,yeah?"
- He's going for high score.
"- Happy birthday, Freddy."
Happy Birthday.
Let me see what I got.
I wasn't into making a big deal after the ten-year thing.
"Hey, hey, how you doin'?"
"Sorry, Freddy."
Hey.
"[ Figgis ] I was wondering if you'd be able to, uh, come by."
Yeah. 4 Aces.
Where else?
Shit!
Damn it.
Two kinds of people in this world.
Pinball people and video game people.
"You, Freddy, you're pinball people."
"Always got somethin' to say, Figgsy."
Come on.
"Freddy, Freddy, Freddy."
Freddy!
Freddy!
Come on.
- Two months?
Two weeks.
Two months?
Connor.
"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"
Blair?
"Blair, Blair."
Hello?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
"Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair."
Shit.
Just stick to the plan.
Just stick to the plan.
"Yeah, we'll stick to the plan."
We're good.
We'll just ah...
"I love you, too."
Where's Nick?
He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
"Sime, what do they say about the weather?"
I believe we can expect bora wind.
But I already missed last time.
Lebicada will start blowing.
You can expect 3-5 on Bofor scale.
"Mist in the morning, it'll go away in the afternoon."
You should sail away as late as possible.
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day?
Are you out of your mind?
"I told you, now it's up to you."
"Put this piece there, too."
Lebicada on St. Nicholas' Day...
"- I'll be off, Stef."
Bye.
- See you.
Come and get it!
We've got nice salad!
"- Here I am, Ivka, Mirta."
"- Hi there, Sime!"
Bills for you...
- Do you have something for me?
- A letter.
- Wait!
Take this.
- There's no need.
- Thank you.
Bye!
- Bye.
"- Hey, Tesla!"
"- Hi there, Sime."
- I've got a letter for you.
- Thank you.
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
- This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
I don't know.
You set the bar pretty high.
Oh.
That's funny.
I'm Carol...
Rance.
I know.
I just came in to look at the space.
How are you with decorating?
"Uh, try me."
Okay.
"When you were thinking of taking this job, where were you gonna put your desk?"
Uh...
I always thought here.
So you could see the view...
Plus it's more convenient for jumping.
"Clearly, you've given this some thought."
I have.
Just so you know...
Mm.
"...the reason I didn't take the job is,"
I really think I'm at my best when I'm supporting someone else.
I'm a great number two.
"Yeah, I don't want a great number two."
Sure.
I get that.
I want a partner.
"Hey, mertala."
Is she here?
Who is it?
!
It's Mr. Matt!
I don't know
You don't know.

Sit down.
Put the blinders on her.
"Come on, you guys."
"All right, Lockhart, powder."
Like a bunch of tin crooks.
You know better.
m.
I've been to the Biesbosch.
I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
"Hey, you there!"
"Look here, governor."
- Steady!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Police!
"Chase him, somebody!"
Get a copper!
Police!
Hurry.
"Come on, open up!"
Let me in.
I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- Dr. Jekyll's not home.
- He told me to wait.
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in!
- You'll have to come back.
"- Let me in, or I'll bash this door..."
"If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police!"
That's him!
There he goes!
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!
Help!
Police!
"- Good night, Charles."
- Good night.
- Sorry your young man was detained.
"- So am I, Uncle Geoffrey."
"Good evening, sir."
"There was a ring at the door a while ago, sir."
"When I answered it, there was nobody there."
"Yeah, I skated away and called you a big baby."
"Sophie threw a rock at me and you yelled, ""you're so gay."""
I did do that.
"Oh, didn't I?"
We used to use that word a lot.
You used to be able to call anything gay.
Ugh.
Do you ever miss that?
- No.
- No.
That's hurtful.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, Mitchell."
"You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was..."
I was not a good big sister.
I'm so sorry.
Will you forgive me?
"- Yes, yes."
- You do?

You look good.
I can tell you're in shape.
You take care of yourself.
You'd be surprised how many guys show up looking like sewer shit.
But not you.
Not you.
I like that.
You got to take those glasses off.

"Got your bell rung, huh?"
But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you've been away.
Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
Ooh!
Now all we gotta do is find it.
Oh...
"Let's go, Larry."
Very good.
"Yes, here we are."
No one sees us.
"Good, good."
Yes.
"Okay, Larry."
Here we go.
Let's go.
That's good.
Okay.
Oh.
Larry.
"Oh, pardon my vigor."
"Now, Larry, if we meet any other boaters, let me do the talking."
"Hang on, Larry, I'll be right back."
"Don't go anywhere, lover."
Everything will be fine.
"I've got everything under control, Larry."
One day we'll look back on this and laugh.
"Ah, there we are, perfect."
"Okay, Larry, here we go."
"Help me out here, Lar."
Scooch over.
That's good.
Okay.
What?
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Larry."
Of course you'll still be attractive to me after the autopsy.
"Yes, to Lázaro Cárdenas."

OK.
Bye.
How much money do you think the Old Lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
I don't know.

"Yeah, it's really good."
It's like...

Sizzling?
"Yeah, it'II..."
It'll save your life.
It's amazing.
Weird.
It'll definitely help with physics.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you gonna get?
Hi.
I didn't know you were...
Didn't know you were working today.
This is a surprise.
"Yeah, shift change."
"So, can I start you all, you know, with some water before I come and take your order?"
It sounds great to me.
Yeah.
Just water.
All right.
Just working on some physics here.
"So, we need some..."

I was afraid you'd leave me if I did.
You were wrong.
I know what you're thinking.
How could I not be angry?
"But the man I fell in love with was Craig Ellers, not Paul Stark."
Everybody deserves a little forgiveness.
"Hey, where's Mary?"
- I got good news and bad news.
"- Oh, no, no."
"The good news, I got back with my girlfriend."

- Bad news is you lost Mary.

It's open.
I'm coming in.
"Hello, I'm Ilia, nice to meet..."
Don't turn the light on.
But...
Leave it off.
Okay.
I need to call the office first.
"Sir, would you like a one-hour or two-hour session?"
It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.
Will you give me the body shampoo?
Not easy washing you without seeing you.
Let me wash you.
"Is it you, Chong-su?"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...

To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."

If it was John... why?
Cos I told her about the job.
I told her about the fucking job and he found out.
It was me who found her body in the car park.
It was me who made the phone call.
"David, let me help you."
Please.
Julie-Ann wouldn't want you to do this.
"If what you're saying is true, and it was John, then this needs to come out."
"- David, we need to go."

"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.

Ten after four.
- Huh?
- Ten after four.
That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."
Hit 'em!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doin'?
Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
-I saw our future.
What?
-He came to me.
-Seriously.
"He said ""Sven go through there fast!"""
I'll go with you.
But he lacked fly.
Sven-

-What is this?
-It is amazing.
"-Seriously, never saw it."

"Brothers and sisters, behold the power of Sven."
On that day I made an oath.
Sven ...

I promise to use my powers only for good things.
"For eternity all the time, to create ... eter a new ..."
Is there no end to the power of Sven?
-Will you marry me!
"No, marry me!"
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!
What jokes ...
"But if I love some, who love girls."
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?
"Someone, either."
No one.
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
"That's what people do when they love each other, isn't it?"
I'll never forget you.
Go to the hospital now.
- You'll come and see me?
- I guarantee it.
- Now I suppose you want some time off?
- A day or two.
Well...
Take Thanksgiving.

Shall we?
"Come on, give me that."
- Wait!
Is that Jonathan?
It is Jonathan!
- Give it to me.
He won't let me in.
I just want to apologize.
Why don't you stay here and I'll try and talk to him?
Thanks.
Did you try him at home?
"Hi, you've reached Michael and Jenna..."
"Hey, he's not there and his cell's still turned off."
You told him you were coming here.
"He knows, right?"
I told him.
"Or, I mean..."
What?
Did you?
"Oh, man."
I'm not gonna do this.
- I can't do this.
- Do what?
- What's wrong?
- Can't do what?
- Chris?
"Chris, can't do what?"
"- Jenna, please."
"- Can't do what, Chris?"
- You should just talk to Michael.
"Talk to him about what, Chris?"
What the hell are you talking about?
"Listen, don't ask me any more questions, please."
He should be telling you.
- Tell me what?
- I don't know!
- Tell me what?
- I don't know!

- I don't know!
- Who is he with right now?

You're always working.
When do I tickle you then?
This sieve is steaming hot!
It could hurt you.
"Well, dear?"
What are you doing here?
I came here for a soft-drink.
What are you messing with the refrigerator for?
I want a fruity.
"It's over, I say."
Go away.
I want one!
Go away!
"Didn't I warn you, dear?"
You've burnt your hand now.
"Look what has happened, Mom!"
"Don't disturb me, Bharti."
Let me work.
Aunty!
See what's wrong with Bharti.
So what's wrong?
What happened?
Kaushalya has burnt my hand.
"Burnt you, did she?"
!
But what happened?
"She burnt Banwa first and then me, too."
Banwa?
What was he doing there?
He was only tickling her.
I see.
I checked the tenant list.
"Remember Don Ameche, the actor?"
He lives here.
"Oh, yeah."
And somebody else.
Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?
"- Oh, you're kidding."
"- No, sir."
He lives right here.
[Chuckles]
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico...
What was it?
Three years ago.
"Yeah, so I hear."

We're gonna be spotted there.

"Oh, here you are."
You're just in time.
I was about to fix some tea.
"Oh, I can't stay."
I'm late for my class now.
I just come over to deliver Wilbur.
"Well, if you can't."
Have a good time.
Thank you.
I have problems with food in my house.
"Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?"
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!
God!
She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!
Where to?
Aren't you ashamed to watch a woman bathing?
!
And where are you going?
"But I'm a girl, too."
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!
Do something.
"You stand and watch, while she falls inside!"
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.
Let me see...
Relax!
I'll ask her!
Aunty!
What has happened?
Nothing.
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.
A blouse?
Did a blouse make so much of noise?
!
Did a blouse make the noise?
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
Very thoughtful of him.
What did you say?
What a spectacular rise!
As of now you have made $120.000.
Congratulations.
Shall I sell?
Let's just hang on for a while.
I'll be back shortly.
Is Mrs. Ryan in?
"No, she isn't."
She's expected.
"Well... may I ask who's calling, please?"
Clementi Sabourin.
And may I ask who you are?
"Why, I'm Mrs. Ryan's secretary."
Oh.
Have you worked for Mrs. Ryan long?
A few months.
Why?
I'm an investigator.
For whom?
For myself.
I'm the prying kind.
"Tell me, my dear."
Where do you come from?
I'm from Texas.
"Oh, yes, I've heard of it."
"Well, may I say that Mrs. Ryan has found herself a most attractive secretary."
"Thank you, sir."

"The arm is gone, otherwise I'm fine."
What else?
Nothing else.
- I wanna know what you want from me!
- I just wanna bury the hatchet.
You probably won't believe me.
"The arm is gone, it's not gonna grow again."
- I'll take three.
"- Mm, good boy."
Get some flesh on those bones.
How's everything in here?
All right?
"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."

Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.

Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?

"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
Do you work every day after school?
That's gotta be tough.
"Um, no, just three days."
My moms don't want me to work any more than that.

"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
-No.
"I'll go alone, I'll go alone."
"-No, I'll go with you."
"-No, I'll go by myself."
I'll go.
"No, I also have to get something."
"The recipe, so I can cook for you."
I'll go with you?
.
"Fine, it's up to you."
And tomorrow's your birthday!
You're already 28 years old!
What would you like me to cook for you?
It's up to you.
-No!
"Just tell me, I'll cook it for you."
-Anything.
What?
Anything you want.
"Sorry, I can't come later."
Joy said she's coming with me.
Okay then.
I'll find a way.
I really need to see you.
Yes...okay.
I'll just call you.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
You heard it right?
"I was talking to mommy, I just asked how she's doing."
-Are you sure?
.
-Let them get along.
-You are right!
Right!
Let's get out of here!
I thought I was a good father.
"Goodbye, Emperors!"
This incredible Penguin here you never see.
Never again!
"Hey, Atticus!"
Snack time.
Erik!
I think they're sleeping.
What jokes!
They are not here.
Bo!
Boadicea!
"Come on, Atticus!"
"Stop kidding, where are you?"
"I know it's hear me, Atticus?"
"Gloria, do you think they could have fled?"
"Alone, out there?"
"-Perhaps, followed Ramon."
-Love.
"I know, I know, but I need go look for them, right?"
-I will not take.
"-Dude, relax."
We will find them and when we find you solve things.
You're a good father.
"I'll be back as soon as possible, right."
-That was a big one.
-I hate when that happens.
"Hey, Will, are you?"
I ain't gonna get the gold safety award.
- [hoof steps approaching] - hear that?
That must be her.
- [bleats] - come on.
[boys grunting and panting] [dazzler] help me.
[grunts] hey.
Watch out.
- [bleating] - get him away.
- [moans] - how'd you get in here?
"Hey, come on, get out of here."
[Rocky] watch out!
He's looking at me like he knows me.
"Hey, what do you want from me?"
Get away!
He's got Tia's vest.
Get him!
Quick.

"May I see your ids, please?"
Tony?
Show him our id.
What's happening?
Why?
Don't leave me up here.
"Open the door, Tony."
You can't go in there without ids.
- Now seal it.
- How do I get down?
[boys panting]
Tia!
"- Quick, let's get her out."
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
"This is what... recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids -- boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This my home.
It is!
You got character.
I don't make this offer to just anybody.
"Sarge, I got a great-lookin' gal to go home to... not to mention my wife..."
so it just ain't in the cards.
Igor.
Another glass of cheer.
You think you got it rough?
Look at that guy.
"- ## [""Harbor Lights""] - [Sighs]"
"Boy, he looks terrible."
What's his story?
"He got a ""Dear Maxie"" letter."
- Says he's got nothin' to go home to.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Well, that's a shame."
Please.
Allow me.
"Some tune, huh?"
The greatest.
"For a certain little lady and me, that was our song."
"This drink's on me, Maxie."
Please.
Don't call me Maxie.
Only Laverne called me that.
And...
- And...
"- That's it, pal."
Get it off your chest.
Tell Joey all about it.
Yeah.
"You're right, Joey."
Who are you?
Where is it?
Where's what?
"Look, when I get through working you over, you'll tell me where it is."
Or do you want to talk now?
"All right, I'll talk."
"Well, talk!"
How's Mama?
(GRUNTING)
This way.
I don't know what you're mad at me for!
"I didn't do anything to you, and I didn't do anything to your wife!"
No one ever double-crossed me.
No one living.
What do you want from me?
I know you have that diamond.
I put it in your pocket myself.
There's nothing in my...
Is this what you want?
"All right, here."
I don't want it.
Are we friends now?
BOB:
Wilbur!
Huh?
"Stop him, he's a crook!"
Hey!
"Hey, man!"
Man!
Man!
"Man, wait!"
"Mister, will you wait?"
They want...
There you go.
"Inhale, reverse warrior, look up."
Exhale.

GIGI:
"- or call my cell, or try me at work  but definitely leave a message here first."
Thanks.
"Hey, Gigi, it's Alex."
How's it going?
Just wondering how you're doing.
I haven't talked to you in a little while and was just wondering how you're doing.
"So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you."
Obviously.
"But you're out, I guess."
So just call me sometime.
Or tonight.
"I'm around, I'll be..."
"Well, I'm in and around."
So that's enough for now.
It's Alex.

You didn't do much to save me last night.
"But I almost died for you today, we're even."
"Bro, yours is a fake gun."
"We're friends, forget it."
Where are you sneaking off?
"You said you're sleepy, right?"
"You go back first, I'll dine with Lisa."
"You didn't sleep too, right?"
How embarrassing to fall asleep on the dinning table.
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.

"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(MEN LAUGH)
Only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.

"She wrote the song ""Happy Trails"""
"and I used to sing that to you when you were on the potty, when we were saying good-bye to your poops!"
Remember?

"Finally, please, get some help!"
-You get some therapy!
-I don't need it!
-That is exactly your problem!
-My problem?
You're unbelievable!
This is why I never come back!
Things always spin out of control with you!
You're like a 2-year-old.
Like a fucking infant!
How did you get to be so rigid?
At least I'm living in reality!
At least I have dignity!
Dignity?
Jesus!
Why are you so afraid?
Afraid?
What are you talking about?
You're insane!

"I'm sorry, can I ask you to step outside?"

"And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?"
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem.
"Like us, he's on his own."
We made a promise to the Captain.
A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
"No, we can't."
Look at him.

"The kid loves me, so why not do it?"
"Whatever time there is, huh?"
"I'm with you, Jimmy."
"- Are we ready to go, Jimmy?"
"- Yeah, I've been ready for 1 4 years."
- She's the one that's had cold feet.
- Go on.
"Robin Wirkus, do you take Jimmy Wexler to be your lawful wedded husband?"
Who the bleedin' hell does he think he is?

There you go.
"Thank you, Grandad."
"You deserve a medal, mate."
Johnnie.

The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I'm Rose.
This is the Nancy.
Rose.
The propeller's snarled.
If I-
- If I can just cut it free--
Just pretend you're Errol Flynn.
He can do anything.
I've cut it free.

"Come on, you beauty."
- She'll do it.
"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back."
"There's no mister, and back home, they call me Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."

He was really scary.
"And he told me, told me I should"
Lose weight.
He called my baby ugly.
What he say to you?
He made fun of my hair.
You have to take another year.
I started when I was thirteen.
Then you can drink your coffee without crying on my nose?
Do not make fun of a grown man.
'You thought I was tough?
-I Was.
You wash the dishes?
"I'm glad I came, Henning."
I do not like it here after what happened.
So let's run away?

"The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken."
But I already got Jerd to fix it.
So it's ok.
Hey!

That really sucks.
C'mon it was just a little job.

"Oh, I've missed this."
"Fucking hell, I've missed this..."

"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."

It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."
"""Troy's Noise""."
Sounds French.
It's not just rhymes.
"In a half-hour, it's done."
Here he is.
Stay in the car!
Get going!
Stop it!
Why'd you screw me?
Stop it!
"Stop, dammit!"
I know who the van gang are.
And their next stunt.
They're in the sticks.
It starts from there.
"In exchange, you cover me."
Or get nailed with me.
Who did you waste?
"Marcus Zerbib, his driver and his goon."
Marcus Zerbib?
The guy who put you in jail?
You'll get nabbed right away!
Not with a good alibi.
Now... you can grab the worst gang around.

"All right, Project Cadmus."
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.
"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?
We didn't come for a play date.

"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!

Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
"No, no, no!"
He's got a gun.

I do not care what you had to shoot him!
I'm glad you shot him!
I'm glad he's dead!
"Ilango, where is Kutty?"
Tell him to come.
He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.
Take him to hospital.
Make it fast.
Shocked?
I'm not Murugesh to get beaten up.
"I'm Vel, Singamuthu's son."

"Oh, no."
Just us playing a few tunes...
And I made the mistake of saying it looked easy.
It's nice to see the guitar.
It's been a while since it's had any recreational activity.
Yeah.
"You know, I should get going."

Come on.
She's just another mom.

- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.
- What did you say?
-
I asked her for some ID.
- Did she give you any?
- No.
"She just said ""Tell John I'm sorry for ruining everything"", and then she left."
What's wrong?
Was it her?
Was it her?
That's your wife?
It was her.
- I'm not sure.
- What?
"I mean, the hair is different."
"- Oh, come on!"
- What?
This is the woman you saw.
"- No, it isn't, John."
"Now, I agree there is a similarity..."
Bullshit!
"John, it's all right."
I'm not all right.
This is the woman you saw.
She was here.
This woman.
Don't you do this to me.
what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Frankie Valli or some big shot?
I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
she was screaming on the street and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.

A lot.
She had these great eyes just like Liz Taylor's.
Henry.
Ready?

This is Wayne.

"Bomb fuse has been lit, Spencer, and the timer started."
You got two hours.

"Any tips or things or ideas, uh, stuff I might do for fun?"
Uh... yeah.
"Actually, you can do some cool mountain biking while you out there."
"But Mom, while you're there, do not do any MDMA."
Okay?
- MDMA?
- Yeah.
That sounds terrible.
"- Yeah, it was."
- Yeah.
Must be very sunny to have to wear those sunglasses where you are.
"Oh, these?"
"Nah, it's just that, you know, a long night last night."
- Eyes a little baggy.
- Yeah.
"- So, anyway..."
"- Well, you look terrific."
Thank you.
"All right, Mom, well, I gotta go."
Ohh.
Okay.

So?
Women today fast for the long lives of their husbands.
You should know all this.
I do.
But how am I concerned?
Oh God!
I thought you'd fast and pray...
I've called so many other women over.
Okay.
I'll ask them to return.
No.
Let them be since they're here.
But ask me before you do it next time.
Tea?
No.
Juice?
I want nothing!
Can't I stay hungry for a day.
I can't hear you...
Just a minute.
What's going on?
What is it?
I want to hear Macarena!
Not now.
We have guests.
You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.
I'm ready.
How do I look?
You always look good.
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!
"Yeah, it's okay."
Look.
It's written in my notebook.
Right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
Please.
Come on.

You know what?
"I'm going to have your badge, Officer..."
"Come on, Shifty."
Let's walk it off.
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
Here's that list you wanted.
Oh.
"Great, great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I...
I should have put more lights back here.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
You can't blame yourself.
It was at midnight.
A British tar is a soaring soul

"Please, I don't need a nurse."
-I just want to sleep.
-Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."
-What is this here?
-Go away.
"Yes, it hurts."

"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Right.
Shh!
Shh!
Marion!
She likes it when she gets a warm meal.
Oh Franz.
I'm not hungry.
"What's this, Chinese?"
How about you?
I'm fasting.
"Say, isn't that strange  to practically fast into one's own death?"
It's just a question.
- Very tactful.
"Yes Dad, very nice."
Right to the point.
What did I say?
Are you hard of hearing?
I've just about had enough.
Shut up!
I won't listen to this crap any more.
It's a good thing when new people come to us.
"You could be a bit nicer, especially to her."
I think so too.
And you shut that thing off!
"Alright, fine."
- Bon appetit!
Thanks.
Do we want to leave?
Why don't we just stay?

"Trust me, it's a good sign."
Can I ask you something?
"Is everyone here, all the workers, are they... what you are?"
"No, a few are human, scientists like you are."
- They're here of their own accord.
- Lucky them.
I'm sorry I had to bring you here like this.
It's not me that I'm worried about.
It's my family.
- My kids.
- You have children?
Two.
Six and eight.
They live with my ex.
You?
You have any little ones?
A daughter.
She's 16.

- It's not good for the nerves.
"Next time, don't choose such a small pebble."
I could barely hear it.
(WHEEZES AND LAUGHS)
- Here's your share.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You boys are expensive to feed.

Especially you.
"Come on, give."

Half of that.
"D'Artagnan, this came earlier."
Porthos!
It's a letter from Treville.
"We have to meet General Verdet's aide in Bourgogne, and escort him back to Paris."
He has news from the front.
What now?
"No, not now, go to sleep."
The war will wait.
"Wait, check you out."
"Girl, you ain't all churchgoing goody two shoes."
Look at that frumpy old church.
"It moved, God moved."
"Shut up, puta."
"Kike, please!"

"I was working, pendejo!"
"Where were you, huh?"
Tough guy?
No.
Where were you?
"Angie, you don't get it."
The shit that...
Goes down behind those walls.
You can't understand.
"And here, my son wants to be like this."

"I'm not Pamela, I'm Sister Mary Maude."
What's with the Irish accent?
- I don't know.
"- Oh, you're a nun?"
With an MA in classical languages.
"Oh, I get it!"
The old split personality defence.
Classic.
- I don't know what you mean.
- She's lying.
All Right.
Would you also like to test me Greek?
"- This is not gonna work, Pamela."
- Stop calling me Pamela.
"Pamela, Pamela."
Pamela.
"Have another cigarette, Pamela."

He's got the anti-warvote.
"Or he'll steal it, like his brother."
"Bobby's a mean little son of a bitch, Edgar."
He had the I.R.S. Auditmy mother when she was dying in the nursing home.
Why my place of origin?
Somewhere else ok?
"Up to you, just be 500m away from Lisa."
"Michael,"
I know what you're thinking.
You want me to stay away from Lisa cos you are not confident.
Good morning Mr. Lin.
Morning.
Breakfast is ready.
Thanks David.
It's my duty.
Good morning Mr. Mak.

Going home to nap.

I don't like to sleep.
What if you fall asleep during investigation?
Wake me up.
Hey!

Driving 2 cars is a waste?
Expect me to sit in your car?
"Really, really fun."
- What are you do...?
- We're just getting into it.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.

"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.

"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"

How are you... how are you doing?
Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.

"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
Get the fuck off me.

Get off him.
I was supposed to protect him.
She's taking him to houston.
Fuck that bitch.
"Come on, man, get up."
Let's get outa here.
[TV baseball game].
You finished?
Yeah.
Alright.
I saw your probation report signed on your bed.
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back at Barker sooner than you thought.
I'm real proud o'you.
'You hear what I said?
Yeah.

"I don't know, you just ...."
You look like her sitting there.

Waitress:
"Here you go, ma'am."

"Well, when in Rome."
"You know, I think it was actually invented in New York City."
Oh.
Okay.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
[Sighs]
"Hi, this is Ken."
"I'm out right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get..."
Could I get the check?
"Say, I was wondering, if I checked out a day early, would I still get all my Extended Rest rewards points for the entire stay?"
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
Have a good night.
- Watch your step here.
- I will.
"Those plants, they don't look nice anymore."
- They're okay.
"- Hey, where are we going, anyway?"
"- Uh, I'm gonna take you to the doctor."
No.
No more talking.
No more lies.
No more lies ever again.
"Nice, but you still have your training wheels on."
Ada!
"Ada, come here."
At least I can still see the road.
Come on.

There's no time.
Bo!
Don't leave me.
"Come back here, you bitch."
"- I'm here, baby."
- Okay.
Okay.
Bo.
Stay back!
What's going on?
What the hell just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.
As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.
My God.
Mass destruction and two dead Furies.
"If it's the chocolates that Saeko-san loves the most, then all the more."
"The confectionery school's graduation exam is today, right?"
Yeah.
"Well, since my family has a cake shop..."
I think I'll be fine.
"Rather, I can finally show my performance."
Performance?
Eh?
What?
"- Ah, nothing."
"Ah, hey."
Can we meet on the 14th?
Valentine's day.
I'm a bit busy on the 14th...
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Well, that's right."
"A guy shouldn't be asking you out on that day, right?"
Sorry.
"Then, the 13th?"
- That's fine.
"Ah, thank goodness."
"Then, the 13th."
- Yeah.
"Then, on the 13th."
Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I'll text you later, okay?"
Bye bye.
"- Yeah, bye..."
I feel like I've been casually rejected...
"Oh, that's right."
The place was bad.
Your answers?
Beaufort and...
I heard you say it.
"Beaufort and Bath, that's what you said."
Yes.
"So, Beaufort is there..."
Show me your first letters.
"And presumably, Bath..."
But that doesn't work.
That doesn't work.
You haven't found the right answers.
I'm going to throw it over to Araucarians for a bonus point?
We think it's Beaufort and Minton.
"Beaufort and Minton, show me your first letters."
Let's see if you're right?
I know you're not.
It is Beaufort and Badminton.
ALL:
Oh!
"Oh, it's so obvious now!"
"The Badminton Horse Trials, of course."
The Horse Trials are held on the estate every year.
Araucarians.
Reveal the hive.
Wojtyla?
Erm...
No.
"Too obvious, isn't it?"
Or is Ratzinger...?
No.
"Yes, Ratzinger's in there."
Is he in there?
"Mummy, can I have my room back?"
Of course you can.
"Come on, darling."
Get out of the bath.
Do try not to cross-question him.
I'm not cross-questioning.
It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is.
I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him.
I'm only trying to find out what happened.
Come in.
Good evening.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
"Better, thank you."
I'm Henry Baker.
Hello.
I'm Lucy.
Lucy Rose.

- This is my husband David.

- How do you do?
Have some hot soup.
Thank you.
- Bread?
"- Yes, thank you."
"Can you tell me the time, please?"
It's ten to nine.
Ten to nine?
- Help yourself to cider.
"- No, thank you."
Thank you.
Good night.

Nope.
"Miss Telford, I'm afraid the elopement's off."
Who are you?
Paul Drake.
I'm a private detective.
You can't stop me.
You've no right to.
I'm 21.
No.
That isn't the reason.
Your aunt--
Your diamonds have been stolen.
No one can leave till the police get here.
I don't care about those old diamonds--
"Merle, let's go back to the house."
"Merle, my dear child..."
"Olivia, your aunt--"
Mr. Drake told me.
Somebody stole Grandmother's diamonds.
"But it doesn't matter, Uncle Howard."
"I'm afraid it's more serious than that, Merle."
Your Aunt Olivia is dead.
She's been murdered.
"You warned her, didn't you, Cousin Julian?"
You said somebody would cut her throat.
[Gina] Just a minute.
Messenger service.
Package for Miss Lenore Adams.
All right.
Thank you.
"Master Huang, here's to you."
Thanks.
Help yourself!
I can help myself!
Make yourself at home!
I'll never be Master Huang's student.
Forget it!
We're still friends.
I'll help you.
I've got it.
What?
You...
"You saved a girl last time, right?"
This time you'll get yourself beaten up.
I don't want to do it!
You must win my master's sympathy.
I see!
Let's do it.
Master...
What's wrong?
Someone just raided the bank.
Mousy went and fought them.
He was outnumbered.
What's happened?
He was badly beaten up.
Where were the police?
They've all disappeared.
Mousy is righteous.
"Take him as your student, please."
Mousy!
He can't even stand straight.
I'll treat you in a special way.
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...

"Yes, yes, speaking."

"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
First we got to create the mood.

I would never say that because you let me live here.
"But because you said it, oh yeah!"
Now look Miley.
Jesse... that guy your dad just mentioned.

I guess you're right.

"ANYTHING YOU REPEAT,"
"NO MATTER FROM WHAT SOURCE,"
"IF IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER OATH,"
YOU'D BETTER STAND ON IT YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"HE MEANS IF THE OLD MAN DIDN'T KILL HER,"
IT'S LIBEL.
LIBEL!
YOU COULD BE SUED.
ANY NEWSPAPER THAT USES YOUR WIRE SERVICE
COULD BE SUED.
"WELL, WHAT KIND OF A WIRE SERVICE ARE YOU RUNNING, ANYWAY?"
"I KILLED IT, DIDN'T I?"

"Look, like that."
"Do it, do it, and after that you will feel better."
You do not like it?
"- Yes, it's very good."
Then I drink it.
And the country is 'hello'.
"Belgium, your country, is 'hello'."
"Half and Half,  or..."
- Maybe.
Maybe.
And what...
What did you find out?
Is Turkey closer to Europe?
I think so.
I think  that...
- And US?
You do not want to.
"You want Turkey, right?"
"- No, well... well..."
But how?
And when?
- It depends...
We've heard these bullshit for centuries.
"Well, at least ten years, okay?"
And it never happened.
We are about to sneeze this exquisite Serbian pork.
"Lady Louise, a gift for you."
She's a little...

Are you really police?
"Those handcuffs are fake, but we need to talk to you."
Where's Yasuo Ikezawa?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
"I'm not lying, we broke up ten years ago."
No way for me to know.
Why should I trust you?
It's been 15 years since that day.
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.

- Nothing.
You know.
I text.
So I get it.
"Sorry, what did you say, mom?"
"You know, lol."
Omg.

Go weapons hot.
"Thank God, Em."
"Daddy, I love you."
You're okay.
I love you so much.
The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"
"Founé, hand me the phone."
Good morning.
"Yes, it's me."
Is the boss in?
Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
-No!
Is it wrong?
.
-I called her because she's my friend!
-Because Bela is your ex!
I don't care!
What does it have to do with this?
"Remember this, you can't leave the house"
-if I'm not with you.
-What did you say?
.
I'm not leaving?
.
That's not going to happen!
What?
Are you smothering me now?
.
Is that it?
-Is that what you want to happen?
.
-No.
I'll make sure you're not cheating on me
"That's why wherever you will go, you'll have to bring me along!"
"If you want to know, fine!"
If you're always like that...
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I'm really going to leave you!
-Give that to me!
Give it!
-What the--
Saturday night in the gutters.
"Long way from home, sir."
"It never was much of a home, Cooper."
"No, sir."
That it weren't.
"Did you volunteer for this lot, Cooper?"
"Er, no, not exactly, sir."
I was invited to join by a magistrate.
?
Here's adieu to all judges and juries
?
"Justice and Old Bailey, too"
?
For they bound me to King George's army
?
So adieu to old England
?
Then it's over the seas that I wander
?
"To stand to the red, white and blue"
?
For they gave me the old King's hard bargain
?
So adieu to old England
?
Adieu
"Who untied you, Harper?"
"Miss Teresa, sir."
What have you got there?
"Oh, it's just a little wild bird."
Won't it fly away?
No.
Where did he go?
You want to wear it now or later?
Go to hell!
"Sir, be careful."
Slippery floors.
"Mr. Lin, I'm Lo Keung."
Why is this with you?
I found it at the crime scene.
I saw who killed your brother.
Tell me then.
I never pay for information.
Tell me now.
It's your citizen duty.
Or I'll bring you to the police.
Cut your crap!
How to escape with no money?
Petty jerk!
Tell me now!
Ok.
I'll talk...
Stop!
...
Tell me!
Help me!
Come!
...
Will you talk now?
I'll talk...
"Around 3am, I was going to steal a car."
"I saw a couple walking to the car, I guess it was your brother."
"When he opened the door, 4 men attacked him."
No...
"He'll probably be furious, but we're used to that."
Who's we?
"Oh, me and Pauline."
It's my boss.
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.
Oh.
I thought he was married.
"Well, yes."
That's been the complication.
The boss I met?
Mr Stanley?
Yes.
But he is married.
I heard him saying something about his wife.
They don't get on.
They're all very showjump-y.
Who are?
The wife and the daughters.
He's got daughters?
Yes.
Two.
They do dressage.
But you haven't had an affair with him?
"Well, yes."
What did you think you were doing?
To them?
What I was doing?
To their family.
You had no right.
He was somebody's husband and he was somebody's father.
"That's wrong, Enid."
You're dead after the war.
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Bark!
Can you sign this?
Those are the addresses you requested.
I added the telephone numbers.
Was it hard?

I don't think the king knows.
But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.

It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.

Wait a second.
Lily's smart?
- Look.
"- I mean, there's proof of that?"
- Yeah.
Right there.
- Yes.
Huh.
"They asked Alex to skip a grade, too..."
"- It's not a competition, Claire."
- ... but we felt... that it would be too much stress to have her with kids so much older.
- Good for Lily!
- Yeah.
"I just always thought she was, you know..."
- So did we.
Yeah.
- Us too.
Yeah.
- How was your big night with Javier?

Candy cigar?

Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."

You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.

But Brian is here.
"Yeah, well, wasn't that how you guys planned it?"
"Adam, who are you blaming here?"
Marjorie or Brian?
I'm not blaming anybody.

You have a little situation there.

He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.

A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.

She said it was a white guy.

You're nuts.
"Now, wait a second."

Let's clear the whole table.
"Very simple-- if you'll just pay attention,"
The first person to get the answer to the next problem
Doesn't have to go talk to Ms. Rinsky.
"Deal. ""Two trains are leaving the station at the same time..."""
Fine!
I'll go.
What was I worried about?
It had been months
Since I last saw ms.
Rinsky.
She might not even remember me.
Hi.
Ms. Rinsky.
Frankie Heck.
Brick's mom?
Ohh.
Not today.
She remembers me.
Would you like me to come back another time?
No.
Sit.
Talk.
Unburden yourself during my limited free time.
Okay.
"Well, see, Brick got a ""d"" on his math test."
"Sometimes kids get D's, but not your son."
"Oh, no."
He has to be perfect
"At every single thing he does, right, mommy?"
I...
"You know, ms."
"Rinsky, you're very funny."
Brick never mentioned how funny you are.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?

"The poison is still fresh, three days."
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
Senor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
"If you insist, senor."
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
You!
- You monster!
"- Don't fool with me, ya little brat!"
"Contract or no, I'll blast-"
- Ow!
"- Why, you little fool."
- Eric!
"Eric, look out!"
After him!
Come on!
Ow!
Say good-bye to your sweetheart.
Aah!
Babies!
My poor little poopsies.
"Eric, you've gotta get away from here."
"No, I won't leave you."
"You pitiful, insignificant fools!"
Look out!
Now I am the ruler ofall the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
So much for true love!
"She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?"
"Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty."
Children got to be free to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
I-I...
Did.
"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...
God!
Why did you have to tell me?
"Left, right, face."
Forward.
Your brother was a good man.
"Yes, he was."
She won't get out of the car.
Oh...
Hey.
"Welcome home, Maggie."
"You know, I think it'll make you feel better to be with everyone."
We all miss him.
That led was not your fault.
And it's also not your fault that you survived and he didn't.
Get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
- No.
No.
No.
"When we got back from Nam, we had a hard time too, but we got over it."
Out.
"- Take her home, Percy."
"- Come on, baby."
"It's okay, baby."
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Why don't you, uh...?"
Why don't you lose that shirt?
Come on.
- Unh.
- Drop that belt.
Take your clothes off.
Want some coffee or something?
Let's sit here.
I saw Helen in the newspaper.
It was crazy.
Four guys were killed.
'You know something more than us?
-Do Not.
"No, they are keeping secret."
I stayed out of me to know that there is a killer where you live.
"How are you going, Mom?"
-Incredible!
I can not wait to get out here and fix my life.
You are halfway yet.
Need to complete the program.
I suppose.
I need.
And how are you?
How are they?
Have done well?
-They Are good.
Okay.
And the school then?
-Are You ... cool.
Dating?
"Oh, tell me."
What is her name?

He treats you well?
Do not say anything to Helen and Svend.
-You Can leave.
-Are You good?
"Yes, yes."
"And this is my son, Hogarth."
"Thank you, Annie."
Hobart.
That's Hogarth!

(KNOCKING)
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.
I wasn't gonna say that.
"I have something for you, Hogarth."
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
Up at the power station.
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?
"See anything unusual, Hogarth?"
"No... thing... unusual, really."
(TOILET FLUSHES)
Gotta use the bathroom.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(GASPS)
"Strange, he's so tightlipped now."
And the other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
(CHUCKLING) A hundred-foot robot?
-He's....?
"-Yeah, he's fine."
Yeah....
-Absolutely.
-Good.
ALICE:
"I was trying to remember, actually, the last time I saw Stephen and Phillipa."
I think it must have been Aunt Ena's funeral.
-I presume he's still working on the Advertiser?
-I don't know.
-Deputy news editor there or something.
"-Something like that, yeah."
"Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
And she still...
-does whatever she does in the City somewhere?
"-Yeah, I think so."
"-Yeah, that's right."
-Right.
And I suppose....
How old would Julie be now?
"Fourteen, I suppose, she must be."
"Fourteen, yeah, God."
"It makes you think, doesn't it?"
-Yeah.
-Certainly does.
"Oh, yes, how could I forget?"
I managed to get you some samples off the Givenchy counter.
-You didn't!
You little angel.
-Ysatis.
"Which I know you always wear, come rain or shine."
"Wait, the Chemical Brothers?"
I don't think...
"Oh, you've heard of them."
"Wait, wait, wait, look."
"- Look, look, look."
"- Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"The Chemical Brothers, okay."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, they have their own Wikipedia article, and everything."
Wow.
"Now, they're real brothers, right?"
"- Well, I would hope so."
- [Laughing]
"Well, this is nice."
"Very impressive, huh?"
"- Yes, it is."
It's cool.
- Very nice.
- That's cool.
- I am done with my tomato cutting.
"Oh, thank you, Christine."
We're just gonna throw those in the salad.
- Okay.
- And let's eat.
- It's time to eat.
- 'Cause we're hungry.
"- Yeah, I'm hungry."
- And I'm saying the blessing this time.
"Daddy, don't be too long winded this time, please."
"Make it two minutes this time, two minutes."
Okay?
Ken:
Sofie isn't here.
"Try her at home, right?"
'Bye.

You won't see nothing.
Okay.

Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.

To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"

-I got a faint pulse.
-Pulse ox is 80.
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
-What's his core temp?
-Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
I'm sorry!
I'm trying to be totally honest with you!
"Jenna, I could've lied and I'd be inside that door right now, but I didn't."
"Isn't the truth more important than anything else, Jenna?"
Not if the truth is you slept with another woman!
Jen?
Just listen to me for one second.
I'm so sorry.
"Baby, I'm so sorry."
"Jenna, please..."
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me for one second.
I mean it!
I mean it!
Get...
Get away from me!
"Where are you going to go, Jenna?"
Jenna?
- Get away from me!
- Listen to me!
Jenna?
Stop!
I love you!
- Motherfucker.
- Jenna?
Jenna?
Don't even think about coming in the house.
"Michael, I mean it."
- Okay.
I'm not gonna come inside.
"- Damn right, you're not."
"But I'm not gonna leave, either."
If you can bring it.
"Sir, I am reading you for the past 40 years."
"But sir, sorry."
"You don't look like you are 40, sir."
Go.
"- You look a few months younger, sir."
"Now, you disappear and bring the newspaper."
Come on.
"Sir, not the newspaper but the news is here."
Yes.
Mind your own business.
Leave.
I will say good morning to ma'am.
- Leave.
"Good morning, ma'am."
"- Delete, you are here too?"
I follow sir wherever he goes.
Have a seat.
Sir is coming.
- Okay.
"Okay, ma'am."
Hi.
- Hi.
How did you come here suddenly?
I told you yesterday I will meet you today.
Yes.
Right.
Have a seat.
- Okay.
You came at the right time.
Otherwise I was going to leave soon.
"Well, my mother says time favours those who value it."
"Phew, it smells."
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
You OK now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"And some money, too, I hope."
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
"Oh, these mountains."
"Oh, it's my first time here."
"- Well, welcome."
- Thank you.
"And the air, it's refreshing."
Don't you find it refreshing?
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"Oh, and you have that omelet everyone loves."
- [Chuckles] Sure.
- They talk about it everywhere.
- It's on every menu.
- [Chuckling]
"Oh, I love Denver."
Oh.
- I'm here.
- Excuse me?
Christine Baskets.
- Oh.
- Guest of the day.
"Yeah, the computer just does that at random."
Oh.
"Well, you thank that computer for me."
Okay.
"Um, it just means you get 10 percent off a pay-per-view movie."
Oh.
Could I trade that in for a free breakfast?
I can look into that for you.
Thank you.
"So, what brings you to Denver?"
"Oh, I'm just, uh, passing through."
[Vacuum cleaner whirring]
"- No, because it happened before I knew him."
- Oh.
- So he didn't think of telling me.
- All right.
- But I was angry.
All right.
Down here - There are a lot of pictures over here.
- Right in the front.
"- Oh, upstairs?"
- I think so.
- Not here?
No.
"- No, not here."
- All right.
The front of the building - in the front.
Hmm.
"Well, do you know which way, Ida?"
Maybe over there?
I'm not sure.
- I don't know.
All I know is that when you come in.
- This is the front entrance here.
- It has to be here.
- So let's have a look.
"Ida, there's no pictures here."
"- Well, it is somewhere here."
"- Okay, let's turn around."
- Yeah.
- Let's turn around.
- Yeah.
- There's one more place.
- Okay.
(laughter)
- Fuck?
What the fuck?
How did you do that?
- I didn't do that.
It just happened.
"- Come on, what do you think--"
- Don't fucking touch me.
"Now, just tell me how you did it."
How the fuck did you do that?
Horace:
"Hey, it's a trick."
Horace Sr:
"Tell him it's a trick, please."
Horace:
It's a trick.
- I don't know any tricks.
I just watch nature happen.
- Nature?
You fucking freak!
What?
"My eyes didn't see that, all right?"
What did you do?
What happened?
"- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick."
He's doing-- Show him the trick.
- I don't know.
Horace:
Show him the trick or we need you to go.
- I don't know.
Here.

"Don't, don't!"

Dalton...
I didn't know you were a friend of the family.
"Hey, I didn't put him there."
I'm tryin' to find the guy who did.
"Mm, sorry, I don't know why I said that."
That's okay.
"I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh?"
I don't think so.
Dalton.
"Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic."
"Well, that's okay."
I guess we've both had a long day.
"Hey, you hungry?"
Yeah.
What kind of food do you like?
Anything.
"Like, you want a picnic?"
Ha... are you serious?
"Sure, why not?"
"Why not, indeed."
Cheers.
[Giggling]
This is really romantic... cheers.
Is that pouilly fume?
- Pouilly fume?
- Um-hmm.
I don't think I have...
I've had pouilly fuisse.

Junior's doing this for attention?
"I'm telling you now, this little distraction better not interfere."
[GRUNTING]
Ha-ha-ha.
Kid had a glass jaw.
Hilarious.
Can we go?
Today's the day.
Don't tell me you're not excited.
"Right now, my king, I'm more focused on the matter at hand."
[ALL GRUNTING]
-Well?
"-Yes, I'm excited."
Today's the day.
Stealing ice?
Seriously ?
"Isn't that a bit cliché, even for Captain Cold ?"
Come on.
We don't have time for this.
[GRUNTS
"Calm down, Kid."
"Oh, please."
"You'll chat it up with the cops, with bystanders with Cold , even."
No.
No way.

"I don't need anymore money, Dad."
"Put it in your pocket, I can be stubborn too."
Do you feel alright?
I feel fine.
You're sure?

I'll be late for rehearsal.

WAITRESS:
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."
Hey.
I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"
- Shh!
"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."
- See you later.
"- Okay, have good day."
- Good.
You're still here.

Cary asked me.
I know.
He's just on a call.
"So, the IRA agreed to an Offer and Compromise, on your tax case."
The IRA?
The... the IRS.
"You'll have to pay a penalty, we can deal with all the specifics later, but you have some un-cashed checks in your file."
You should take a look at those.
Thanks.
I'm not gay.
You asked whether I was gay?
Yes... two years ago.
I know.
I wanted to answer.
"I'm not gay, I'm flexible."
Okay.
Flexible.
Good.
"And, uh..."
"Lana Delaney, this FBI agent, that's... flexible?"
Yeah.
So why should I care?
Fuck.
-What?
"-He missed the punch, fucked up--"
"Mickey, could you keep that to yourself next time, let him play through?"
Let me talk to him.
Sorry.
Yeah.
"It's not there, but that's a direction."
-It's okay?
-Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
-Truthfully?
"-No, lie to me."
"Yeah, truthfully."
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
"I don't know what I mean, exactly."
I just....
"I mean, l--"
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in exactly....
Or enough.
I don't know.
They don't seem inspired.
Inspired?
-Next year's too far.
"You're only a boss, Frank."
I'm the fucking mayor.
Mayors rule.

Why do I get the feeling you're getting the bigger half?
Let me ask you something.
If I'd have offered you less...

You got what you wanted.
I like to kiss the pretty ones.
There's another pretty one.
You got BankExchange.
-How did you know?
-l saw the kiss.
I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.
But he'll take a bath on those leases.
It'll just take him longer.
"-Something for him, something for me."
-More for you?
"No, no."
More for the city.

Not his brother.

A problem with the death of young girl happens.

Say hello to someone.

How long has it been like this?
Just a few days.
So?
The symptoms- they're the same as the others'.
There's gotta be an explanation for what she has.
They say they don't know.
What is it?
Oh God!
Who the fuck did this?
What?

You okay?
Get your husband.
Who did this?
Who the fuck did this?
Jong-gu!
Jong-gu!
What's the matter!
Does he drink a lot?
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.
Cut back on the drinking.
Yeah.
It's started.
You better brace yourself.
What I said the other day-we'll do it tomorrow.
Where is Hyo-jin?
He's in the army now.
I think I've seen everything I want to see.
Thank you very much.
Sergeant.
Billy Parkin?
"That's right, sir."
"Hello, sir."
What's this all about?
Murder.
I'll never forget coming back from the pub.
And there she was.
Dead.
- That was the worst shock of my life.
- I'm sure.
Bloody Henry Faber.
"My hero, he was."
Bastard.
Even wounded in the war.
Medals on his chest.
"Anyway, what do you want me for?"
These are photographs of German military graduation classes.
"Same year, different schools."
Take your time.
"- I am looking for Faber, aren't I?"
- Yes.
That's him.
That's him.
That's Faber to the life.
And look.
"Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of German intelligence."
"And right behind him, his young student - the Needle."
- Going fishing?
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."

That will do.
"Hey, you now.. come here!"
Come here!
Indy!
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
"Oh, my God."
Marion.
These good people want to see me fuck you now.
No!
"We're gonna go away, We're gonna go away."
We're going to Berlin.

It's Ok.
"It's Ok baby,"
No!
You'll die Adrian!
Kill me baby!
Kill me baby!
No!
What have we done?
Wait a minute.
We think clearly this cannot be explained.
It's easy to explain.
You wanna know who and what I am?
I'm a killer.
I kill with my cunt.
You can write about it... in Midnight Magazine.
Or National Enquirer.
It's gonna be a new sensation.
You wanted to know where I'm from?
I'm from connecticut.
Mayflower stock.
I was taught that my prince would come.
"Oh, it's Hyotei!"
Hyotei is here!
- Yo Tezuka.
- Atobe.
Where did this kind of manners come from?
"How are you doing, players of Seigaku?"
Hoi?
You even send Junior students when your own players aren't good enough.
Hmm.
Who are you?
Really cute.
Tezuka.
We'll see you eat dirt today.
All the best.
You are?
Higaki Shioin.
The next player on the court is Seigaku's Tezuka against Gokuin's Nakano.
"Finally, he's playing."
"Oi, Echizen."
Why aren't you watching the match?
"You're Seigaku's regular, right."
Watch the match?
Why?
What why?
Kaidou.
I'm just saying.
"Anyway, I don't like these kind of things."
Tennis is just a game for solo players.
There's also doubles.
Is it that fun?
Doubles.
"It looks like you still don't know much, o-chibi."
Come on!
- Hello?
- Are you Mike?
- Who asks that?
"- Nursery lady, Rachel told me to call you."
- Söylememeliydi.
Vermemeliydi my phone.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Well ..
Verdi.
Have I got infected by some kind of trouble?
"-Look, it's none of you."
- Hey!
"I am a cop, you hear me?"
"- Man, I do not know who you are."
"Leave your sister Rachel, told him to look at him."
Why?
"Talk to me, I can not help you, Mike."
Please ...
We have guys.
Interested me.
What could we do that?
Our father did not.
Our mother was dead.
Just me and my brother.
Do not have anything.
We tried to talk to the chaplain.
"Porter'la Father, but ..."
They never let me bırakmayacaklardı comfortable.
So ...
"I know too much, man."
I had to do it this way.
Okay...
"Whoa, whoa."
Step back.
-For crying out loud.
-Thank you.
Hello?
Check.
That better?
Great.
Everybody hear me?
"Up on the shelf, can you hear me?"
Great.
Okay.
First item today...
"Oh, yeah."
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
-What?
-Moving buddy?
You can't be serious.
I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
Do we have to hold hands?
You guys think this is a big joke.
We've only got one week left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
"If you don't have one, get one!"
"All right, next."
"Oh, yes."
"Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting was, I think, a big success."
And we wanna thank Mr Spell for putting that on for us.
"-Thank you, Mr Spell."
-You're welcome.
This sucker's got a lot of symptoms.
"No shissh, Sherlock."
Good luck faking the goiter.
Goiter?
"Oh, my God."
That's why they wanted to see my neck.
"Oh, good lord."
Ooh.
- It worked.
- Yay.
"She says she loves you and she's sorry and-- oh, she's sending you a picture."
Yes.
Perky.
Just erase it.
He's coming.
Done.
"Hey, will."
We found your phone.
"Oh, awesome, thanks."
"Oh, no."
"What, is something wrong?"
"It's just this girl, Stephanie,"
I have to break up with.
What?
She's kind of psycho and we dated a couple months.
Now she thinks we're engaged.
"Yeah, because you proposed to her."
Were you spying on my phone?
Ugh...
"Oh, honey, yes."
And that's how I found out you were engaged.
And I went crazy so I texted back.
Hey.
Is this from Vimy Ridge?
It is.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Say again.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Occasionally.
I can let myself in.
Mam might be asleep.
I'll just see you in.
What's this?
Herbert Kirkby.
From the choir.
Has he done something wrong?
"No, no."
"With it being late, I thought I'd see him to the door."
Right.
Yes.
"Very good, then."
"Baker did very well, as they all did."
The concert.
"He killed Germans in this, Mam."
Very nice.
"You go in, Baker, you chump."
"Sorry you missed it, Mrs Baker."
You'll perhaps manage for a future occasion.
Right.
"You won't be too cold, will you?"
No.
We're in the sun.
"We won't be sitting long, will we?"
"Now, lunch."
"Excuse me, sir?"
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
"Sure, um--"
"Down the hall, take your first right and it's the third door on the left."
"Thanks, Sam."

I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
You know what I mean.
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
-What the hell?
"-Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just gotta go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
-What?
-Check it out.
"Martha Dumptruck, Revenge of the Nerds, Hello Kitty."
-They all rode the same bus.
"-Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"That would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
Down... ow!
I feel like...
"Yes, bitch."
(Playful chattering)
"Here you go, papa."
"Mmm, baby, you killing it."
Thank you.
This food is amazing.
(Phone ringing)
Michael...
Do you mind not doing that at the table?
"Mmm, mmm, mmm."
I got a surprise for you.
"Next week, me and you."
"I got tickets to the game, papa!"
"You know, at the new stadium."
"Look at how close those seats are next to like, home plate."
Check it out.
"What's the matter, you don't like the baseball no more?"
"It's okay, I guess."
"Just okay, huh?"
You wouldn't understand.
"Okay, then tell me, Mike."
"Talk to me, make me understand."
You don't like baseball no more?
"Fine, I get that."
"What do you like, Michael?"
Football?
Basketball?
You like school?
"Oh, I love it."
(Angela giggling)
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
Of course.
Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Goodbye, and thank you."

Wait.

"No, 9."
Fuck.

Hello?
"Marco, is that you?"
"Yes, Benigno."
It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
Where are you?
Outside the clinic.
Dr. Vega told me everything.
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.
"So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like."
"My dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court."
Someone find her some clothes!
"Use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl."
I need a pig here!
(GRUNTING)
(RED QUEEN SIGHING)
I love a warm pig belly for my aching feet.
"-Would you like one, Um?"
"-No, thank you."
Sit!
(CHITTERING)
Sit!
Go away.
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.
Fat boys!
Oh.
There they are.
Aren't they adorable?
They have the oddest way of speaking.
"Speak, boys."
Amuse us.
Go on.
(MOUTHING) No.
Speak!
-Is that being...
"-No, no, it isn't."
"Oh, baby."
I didn't mean to piss you off this afternoon.
I really didn't.
"Can you hear me, baby?"
Honey?
"Peter, can you hear me?"

"Hey, I got it."
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
Which dude?
- That dude?
- Yeah.
No way.
He'd kick my ass.
True that.
"- This is so hard, you know?"
- Yeah.
I know.
It's simple.
"If you ask a cop if he's a cop, he's, like, obligated to tell you."
It's in the Constitution.
Constitution of America?
So go ahead and ask.
- You a cop?
"- No, no."
Not like that.
"Ask it, like, official."
Are you a police officer?
"No, I am not a police officer."
"Okay, then."
Hundred and seventy-five for a teenth.
"The price is the price, yo."

I've got Robbie Williams tonight.
Helene says Gucci can't be left on her own.
She gets scared.
Just do it.
Then you and I can do something nice next weekend.
Can we go to mum's?
It's her birthday.
- You know I can't.
- Why not?
You know my lawyer says we mustn't see each other.
But call me.
"- Hi, Yugo Danny."
- Fuck off.
- I thought the cops had got you.
- I need your blow.
Where the hell is that coke?
About fucking time.
- What's that?
- Sherbet.
What do you think?
My blow comes in one big bag.
There were problems.
That's not 20 grams.
"As I said, problems."
You get the rest tomorrow.
No.
I want it now.
Or you give back my card.
This is Alexander's.
"Oh, you're funny!"
[HONK$]
Whoo!
She is a hottie!
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon?
"[IMITATES SVEN] Oh, you're funny!"
[MUMBLE HONKS THEN SNORTS]
You shouldn't make fun of someone just because they're different.
Especially someone who's come all this way...
- ...to save us.
- You're right.
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.

"Mr. Hong, where've you been?"
Stay there.
"And something sweet, like a cookie or a piece of candy."
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.
I don't have that CD.
Uh-oh.
That's ourfavorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.
"Oh, but look."
- I have it.
- Go get the stuff.
"Don't forget the towel, the washcloths or the cookie."
- Or candy.

-Who was he?
- l sawyou.
- Really?
I've brought a meal foryou.
Here it is.

They are still warm and have this.

"I'm not mad, I just,"
I'm disappointed.
All right?
You're my crew.
So bring your A game.
I'll go do it right now.
"No, forget it."
"I mean, we have enough time tomorrow morning to fill up the tank."
It's the principle of the thing.
Let's just go over this again.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

"Connor, I just came by to say that"
I appreciate all the help.

A bullet proof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
"- Come on, Jimmy!"
Me and you!
- Go on.
"Run, you son of a bitch."
Tommy!
I just want to talk to you!
"Tommy, what are you making me chase you for?"
"Come on, are you mad at me?"
I just shot my dad.
"Call me, Tommy."
"No, I'll call you."
- Get these handcuffs off me.
- Why are you handcuffed?
Where's Detillo?
- He's been shot!
Get off!
- I'm not getting off.
"Hardy, you son of a bitch!"
Get away from me!
You could never beat me!
You like to jump off bridges.
Who's the best cop now?
- Take these handcuffs off me.
- Get some handcuff keys.
- Do you want to take a shot at me?
- No.
"It wouldn't do any good, Eddie."
On the other hand...
Hardy!
You're okay.
Anything to drink?
No.
Water for me.
"Nothing, thanks."
"No, excuse me, uh..."
"Actually, we'll have two strawberry milkshakes, extra whipped cream."
We couldn't find you anywhere.
"You know, finally, your mom stayed up top, and I took the elevator all the way down to the ground floor."
"And I got out of the elevator, and there you were, reciting the alphabet, in French, to, uh, the security guards at the CN Tower."
"And you were little, too."
You couldn't have been more than five.
Not scared though.
"Nah, not one bit."
Heh.
Take your time.
Thank you.
Oh.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Heh.
"My, uh, wallet was in my jacket."
"Oh, no way."
Way.
Do you have money?
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Yeah.
Um...
Three and change.
That's it?
Yup.
"Mmm, not enough."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no."
I understand.
"You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all."
"- Yes, sir."
"- Yes, yes."
You have that cooped-up feeling.
Yes.
"You do understand, don't you?"
"- Yes, yes."
"- Well, then..."
"Well, now, where would we go?"
We might go to Albert Hall.
Yes.
And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"
We could play cards.
"But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you?"
You might read to me.
Yes.
Yes.
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.
Mr. Adda!
-Yeah?
I am not Adda!
I am Chaddha!
Oh Mr. Chaddha!
"-Yeah, go on!"

Where do they come from?
Who are you guys?
I guess you havent recognized us!
"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!
I think you are forgetting.
I am forgetting!
"Yes, right!"
"So guys, do one thing!"
Just forget about it!
Forget?
"What are you saying, Mr. Adda?"
Mr. Chaddha!
"Mr. Chaddha, dont do this, otherwise we will be ruined!"
..
We might die also!
-Yeah!
What can I do if you are going to die?
"Its all right, if you cant do anything!"
We want to meet your boss!
-Yeah!
Then go to right and turn to left!
Game set and match.

I can see better here.
What are you doing here when not even regulars sit here.
- Go away.
- Go away.
Oi.
"- But I'm part of the team, aren't I?"
- That's not what it is about.
Why would a fellow like you be allowed to sit on the bench!
Why aren't you on the way back to America?
You're... a pain in the ass.

"He was very suave, sophisticated."
A man of the world.

I guess I'm on my own.

You're all right.
"- Yeah, you are too."
You're ready.
"- Yeah, I know."
That's what I was saying the whole time.

Girl about this tall?

That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking... (PANTING)
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."

"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"(DISTORTED VOICE) What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
I'll be in touch!
"Hey, you."
Come here!
You got a lighter?
What the fuck you think I have arms for?
You're free to go now.
- You want a smoke?
- Yes.
"Henry, Akan's already started."
"If we do not stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
I can tell you something very important... about the man who sent you here.
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high class establishment.
Follow the door and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
Knock on the knocker!
Ella.
"Ella, you whore."
Take him to Jimmy.
Is this Jimmy?
Hi.
"I'm a fucking car, baby."
A Lexus convertible!
I'm going back in there.
That thing's destroyer-class.
- It feels good.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Oh God, that's amazing."
Yes!
"Fuck, you're late!"
For my brothers.
They are all I think about.
Are they even alive?
I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.
Yeah.
There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.
- The light.
- When's that?
- Tonight.
- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.
***
It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"- Sir, they're gonna be fine."
- They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
"- Well, I'm not gonna let it."
Let's go.
"- But my wound, Gina."
"- Sir, with your brain and my body-- and my brain-- we make one unstoppable unit."
"Now climb aboard, sir."
And let's go.
Oof.
"- All right, everybody ready?"
Good.
Let's set this trap.
- Hello.
"- Hello, Figgis."
-Peralta.
Congratulations on escaping prison.

Congrats on sucking.

I'd love to kill you tonight.
So where you hiding?

-Roundone.
- You're never gonna find me.
I'minvisible.
"- Mommy, I won!"
I won a big pwize!
-Downtown!
"- I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere."
"Yeah, it's okay."
It was nice meeting you.
Likewise.
"You're a very well-behaved young man, you know."
Thanks.
All right.
Veronica.
Virginia?
West Virginia?
Good-bye.
"I never really looked, you know."
I didn't see anything.
That was funny.
Dad!
Hey!
Looks like TV.
Can I use your phone?
The phone's over here.
Where are your parents?
I only have one.
A father.
He's in the T onapiya Wetlands.
What's that?
"Well, this was all once the T onapiya Wetlands."
"He's trying to save the last five acres, but he won't."
Why?
No money.
"He teaches science by day, and, I don't know, tries to save the wetlands by night."
"I admire him, but I pity him, too."
You pity him?
"Well, yeah, his goals aren't realistic."
That's him.
You look like shit.
But your boat looks great.
Yeah.
"I live on my boat, man."
Personal hygiene goes out the window.
A lot of time to work on the place.
BEN:
You should try working on a shower.
NEIL:
Yeah.
"Hey, what can I tell you?"
"Standing on principle, man."
It's all I got.
Cigarette?
"No, I'm good."
"That's right, you quit."
Good for you.
BEN:
So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
"Yeah, pretty much."
What are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
[LAUGHS]
Break.
Any word from Beth?
"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be..."
Sister's what?
Her wedding.
Her sister's wedding.
- Isn't that what I said?
- No.
"You said ""funeral."""
Rosalinda...
For your kindness and hard work over so many years...
The penthouse is yours.
Mommy!
Daddy just gave away our house!
"Oh, really?"
Did he?
Who'd he give it to?
Shalom.
"So, I got assigned Rautavaara's ""Piano Sonata No. 2""..."
"- You know, ""The Fire Sermon""?"
"- Yeah, it's wonderful."
Sounds like a piece of cake for you.
Are you kidding me?
- It's the hardest in the canon.
- We'll get together later.
Who's that?
That's Miles.
He's a junior.
"He studies guitar and composition, and he deejays in Chinatown on the weekends."
He's cute.
"Yeah, he's okay."
"Oh, my God."
He's looking over here.
What's wrong with him looking at you?
I don't want him to see me in this.
This outfit is stupid.
You'll freeze to death.
Here.
No.
Easy.
We'll swap.
Do you think I'm bad?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How can you be sure?
I know.
You're good.
"Well, since I'm good, can you get me a bowl to fetch milk?"
"When I go to the fields, I'll find one."
I want it now.
It will only take two minutes.
I'm late.
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.
Go on.
"Mim Hamideh, hello."
Do you have a milk bowl for the engineer?
"Yes, by the window."
All right.
She says to bring the bowl back.
I have to go.
Off you go.
May God give you pride.
May God give you good health.
May God give you a long life.
- Excuse me.
- Don't mention it.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."

What do you want?
Milk?
"- Yes, that's it."
It says:
"""At the foot of the mountain."""
"Hello, why are you late?"
- Why are you late?
- You've been waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Who told you to wait?
My uncle.
"I see, your uncle is..."
Mr Hashemi Masti.
It's a long way to your village... lt's not far!
Not far?
What do you think of your village?
"I've lived here since I was born, I know it."
We're your guests then?
Yes.
Do I turn left here?
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.
Since two p.m.
I've been waiting since school finished for the day.
My uncle said:
"""My friends are coming."
"Bring them to the house."""
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.
But you mustn't tell anyone.
- All right.
- Good boy.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for lost treasure."
Good idea.
"I know, sweetheart."
I know.
Come here.
"Look, I have to debrief Chappelle."
"I'll see you in a minute, okay?"
"Dad, I know about your drug problem."
Why didn't you come to me with this?
Come here.
Come here.
"I'm sorry, baby."
I'm sorry.
I was embarrassed.
"And it wasn't your problem, and it still isn't."
I didn't want you to worry.
"Well, is it over?"
"No, not exactly."
"I think I'm going to have to go into a program, and get some help."
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
Chappelle wants me to go into the clinic and get checked out.
"- We'll talk about this later, okay?"
- Okay.
Don't worry.
- I love you.
"- Me, too."
Okay.
Jack.
I'm glad you're back.
It's been difficult without you.
"Thanks, Chloe."
- Chase.
- Yeah.
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.
-That's part of it.
"-Yeah, me too."
I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
Seong-bok.
I think it's the owner.
Seong-bok?
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!
Jeon Hyo-jin
You're getting all wet!
Where is Hyo-jin?
In the living room.
Hyo-jin.
You're home early.
Did you lose your trainer?
"No, Why?"
It won't be a problem at all.
Good.
We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.

Anthony.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
"""What do you want to tell me now?"
What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother.
I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers.
I wish I was big just once.
Funny.
You're really funny.
I'm funny?
you know.
It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
you know.
You're just funny.
I know.
Put it under there.
What are you doing that for?
I'm just passing the time.
"If you really love me, then let's make a vow... right here, together... right now."
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
Repeat after me-
I'm gonna be free.
I'm gonna be free.
And I'm gonna be brave.
I'm gonna be brave.
Good.
And the next one is-
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
"Oh, that's good."
You like that?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
Fantastically.
Fantastically.
Courageously.
Courageously.
With grace.

It's not like you're moving to the north pole.
Oh.
That's not yours.
Where was he planning to go?
I didn't hear about anything...
Where was he going to go leaving me here?
Yoon Jae!
Hello.
You made me worried sick.
You should have told me first if anything had happened to you.
"Hey, what are you trying to do?"
!
"Yoon Jae,"
I love you.
Yoon Jae!
"Seo Yoon Jae, that bastard."
Preview
He was two timing you!
It was a double play with another woman!
It doesn't seem like Yoon Jae.
"You made a mistake, right?"
"When kids do something wrong, they just leave the house."
What's that ahjussi doing?
I will make sure that we'll get married someday.
You are very pretty.
"Yoon Jae, you are really here, right?"

Put a dollar in my pocket.

"Come on, do it."
"That's it, come on."
Just a dollar.

She's valuable government property.

"Hey, I can see her face better now."
(CHATTERING)
She doesn't look like Sally.
Are you Sally?
(CHATTERING)
"Well, since it's Judy, we'd, uh, better take care of that leopard."
Uh-huh.
Be my guest.
(GROWLS)
(YOWLS)
"Ok, nut."
Come on down.
"Very nice work with that leopard, fella."
Thank you.
That's a handy gun to have around.
"Mr. Dane, I'm sorry that we doubted you."
We heard her confession.
"But if this is Judy, where is Sally?"
"Uh, beats me."
(THUDDING)
"Judy, stop that."
The least you can do is show them you're sorry.
"Thank you, Judy."
Now all you have to do is tell me where Sally is.
(CHATTERING)
You had the helmet.
You must know where she is.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
We're going to have a baby.
"Which, frankly, scares the hell out of me."
It'll be great.
Yeah.
"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.

Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Next season I'll take you to Wrigley Field.
"Come on, stick with me!"
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field....
"Come on, damn it!"
We'll get a couple of dogs then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?
There you go.
"Hey, stay up!"
Stay awake!
Keep your head up.
Keep your head above water.

Let's go.
Stay with me.

Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...
"Henry, stop dicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
Chop Chop.
Shh.
"It's me, Jimmy."
Move.
"Oh, shit."
Those pigs are here again.
Psst!
Don't compromise my lab.
Let them leave.
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."

Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."

"You're a smart one, huh?"
There you go.
Listen.
Mm-Hmm?
I got about 10 minutes left
On my chicken and potatoes.
I'm gonna go upstairs and talk
To colleen about what happened
In school today.
"You know, it is so not OK to"
Slap your classmate in the
Middle of class.
I'll handle it.
She's out of control.
"Hey, I'll handle it."
I like uncle Johnny.
He's so nice.
He never gets mad.
He never yells at us.
And he never does that thing
That daddy does where he would
"Say something and then, like, a"
"Few seconds later, he'd have to"
Explain that he didn't mean what
He just said.
"Oh, you mean sarcasm."
Yep.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.
- Walker!
"Run, run, run!"
Stenz!
"No, not that way!"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Was that...?
Was that a conscious choice?
- I'm gonna dig into you.
- I think so.
- I think I remember being...
- I love Switzerland.
I think I remember saying it.
It's just...
"Like, yeah."
Well...
"Of course, those aren't gonna work."
And then Andy said a lot of funny stuff here.
He gave that guy a lot of funny names like Cheddar and...
What were the...?
The names were:
"Switzerland, Steinbrenner."
- Cheese.
- Cheese.
T-Bone.
"- T-Bone, yeah."
- Michael.
- And he said a lot of funny stuff.
- Your tighty whities are visible.
Yeah.
Kat made me have the most uncomfortable meeting with Andy Samberg.
- I didn't mean to.
I was so 7th grade and embarrassed.
I didn't mean to.
You were gonna meet him that night or you weren't.
"I was like, ""Oh, Andy's here?"
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
Based on true events
"- Well done, Casper."
- Let me have a go.
- Happy with the flat?
"- Yes, two floors."
I love it.
"One floor is Mia's, the other is mine."
"- Splash, Frank!"
The champ.
- I'm off.
- Where to?
- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."
Surprise.
- How did it happen?
- She choked on a giant olive.
- This big.
"I'm sorry, but may I ask you something?"
What floor is the pediatrics on?
Yoon Jae?
Yoon Jae...!
Yoon Jae...
Yoon Jae...
"Yes, father?"
I went to the hospital to see Yoon Jae...
But he looked really busy.
What?
Yoon Jae's at the hospital right now?
Well...um...
I'll leave the dumplings with the front concierge desk.
So make sure to tell him...
To pick it up and eat it.
He totally dissed me.
Gyung Joon doesn't know that's the hospital Yoon Jae works at...
I'm going to go crazy...
-Assistant principle...
I'm actually...
-What?
What is it?
-It's nothing.
-Teacher Gil Da Ran!
Put down those files right now.
Excuse me?
Those files...
I was looking at them.
Put them down right now.
Those files...
"You were looking at them, Teacher Na?"
"Yes, Assistant Principal."
Have you seen a... wet boy running around here?
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.
"We have witnessed no moist children of the masculine variety gallivanting within these halls, no."
"Oh, hey, Poll."
How's it going?
Oh...
"Hi, Matt."
"You, er, you thought about what I asked you?"
"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."
- What?
- The racket and the whole 5000 votes.
- After you nearly killing the guy?
- Go on.
Beat it.
- Are you staying here?
- Yep.
- So am I.
Molly!
She crashed in CT.
Pressure dropped.
Now she's unconscious.
- Said her stomach hurt.
- Could've blown a mesenteric clot.
"Harper, get four units O-neg."
"Stay with us, Ben."
Paddles.
Paddles!
Charging 200.
Clear.
Charging 300.
Clear.
- I got a faint pulse.
- Pulse ox is 80.
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
"Hey, George."
Gary?
Where the hell have you been?
I've been leaving messages for months.
"- I know, I've been busy."
- Don't give me busy.
Who's not busy?
I'm busy.
We're all busy.
Everybody's busy.
All right.
Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?
Mostly chemotherapy.
"Hey, I'll see you."
"Hey, pig!"
"Hey, hey, hey!"
So you called the cop a pig?
I was yelling at the litterbug.
"I mean, this is my town."
You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
"So, didn't you explain that to the cop?"
"No, I fled the scene."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Kramer, I need to talk to Jerry privately."
What about?
- Kramer.
"- Oh, come on, George you can share it with me."
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?
- Sure.
It wasn't my call.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
[Yelling]
"Come on, Kamen!"
I'm sorry.
"No, Kaman!"
Please don't!
"Oh, God!"
[Screaming]
[Screaming continues]
[Tires screeching]
[Car horn blaring]
[Siren blares]
[Hotch] Yeah.
Kaman Scott worked for Chris Edwards.
- He was fired seven months ago.
- [Garner] Why did he kill him here?
Roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone.
- Anything in the van?
"- Welding equipment, cans of gasoline."
And a cage.
I'm getting everyone in the city down here on this.
"Without his car, he's going to lie in wait until he can't anymore."
Then he's gonna lash out again.
[Siren wailing]
[Train whistle blaring]
Prentiss.
I think I found something.
What do you got?
A girl.
There's two more of the same girl in here.
- [Indistinct]
- Get out of here.
- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.
Bring a yoghurt!
Sorry!
Pauline!
He's lovely...!
"Straight to the top of the stairs and quietly, please!"
Quiet.
Quiet!
"I shall be checking hands, faces, boots, and hair ribbons."
"The Halle Orchestra looks smart, so must we."
"Baker, come here."
You... are a chump.
What are you?
"I'm a chump, sir."
If Miss Riall had seen you in that state that would have been it.
You must really trust me.
- You really do trust me.
"- You're the best, Director Kim."
I told you he's really great.
What trust?
I don't trust people so easily.
"- By the way, he's not my boyfriend."
- Sorry?
"- Oh, come on."
- Come on what?
What?
"But, he said you were."
Do we have to have sex to be boyfriend and girlfriend?
Whatever.
"And yes, you have to have sex."
"Right, Director Kim?"
This is fun.
"We're just friends, you and I."
- Do friends kiss?
- That's so childish.
"Yeah, we kissed once."
Big deal.
Damn it.
This isn't funny.
"No, it's funny."
Very funny.
It's a sea star.
It's dead.
Cigarette.
"When the tide's out, it'll ebb to that lighthouse."
"- Like the Red Sea, right?"
- Yes.
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!
#... around me
"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
I'm dead!
Hurry up!
You're so slow!
My God!
Sissoko!
"Hurry up, Niaré!"
- What's going on?
"- Greetings, Sissoko."
- I was waiting for you.
- Why?
- You called me.
- I don't remember.
That must be it.
"You know, Niaré, you lose your head easily in this world."
"Let's go in and talk, then."
I'm very short of time.
"- Come in, please."
- I'm afraid I can't.
I'll send you a message by phone tomorrow.
Good bye.
Do you need to whine?
Can't you see I'm not well?
"Right, you're ill!"
What was he doing here?
Who?
Niaré!
He came because you invited him.
You asked him to wait here.
You know very well that I didn't call him.
How could I?
I wasn't there.
You're not going to cry over that.
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"Oh, you think you're pretty good, do you?"
I am deadly accurate in everything I do.
Old Mr. Chads here.
The meanest teacher I ever had.
"- Oh, he was harmless."
- Mm-mm.
"Easy for you to say, he liked you."
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
That's because he never knew
I was the one putting' gum on his seat.
"Oh, that was you?"
"He'd jump up all wiggly and squirmy, grabbing' at his backside, th... that squeaky little voice of his cooing like a pigeon."
"Ooh, ooh."
[laughing]
- [cork popping]
- Ooh!
[laughing]
Social studies.
Why do we even need to know the state capitols?
I'm never going to Kansas.
Topeka.
Show off.
Vermont.
Montpelier.
Wyoming.
Cheyenne.
Deadly accurate.
- [cork popping] - [laughing]
- [gasping]
"- Come on, come on, come on, come on."
Shh.
Let me get the door.
We want our mom back.
Have you gone crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You're not our mom.
To your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I've had it.
"Anything else, maybe?"
( Door slams )
I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!
- Say it.
- You're my mom.
- Properly.
You're my mom.
Look at me.
"You're my mom, you're my mom..."
Louder.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
You're my mom.
Stop this foolishness!
I'm not playing along anymore.
Understand?
There'll be only one breakfast and one set of clothes.
And promise me not to talk to your brother!
No.
( slap )
Promise me.
He's not going to die.
You wanted me.
- Why did you kill Foon?
- White Tiger killed him.
You're harboring a fugitive!
"Yes, so what?"
"While you're still alive, I'll only be second-best."
Only Lion's Roar Hall can beat Bo Chi Lam.
You've committed a terrible crime!
You must pay for it!
You're my problem!
Sifu Wong...
Stop!
"Sifu Wong, spare me!"
Please let me go!
Let me go!
I apologize!
I'll turn over a new leaf!
Careful!
"Sifu Wong, I'm sorry!"
"Mousy, go!"
I won't abandon Sifu in his hour of need!
Flying Sleeve!
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
Kill him!
Kill him!
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.
"You trust me, right?"
Take good care of the kids.
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, look, look!"
Look over there!
Go catch him!
Oh...
Hey...
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!
Let go!
Will you be okay?
Are you okay?
- Come here!
- Hey!
What's happening here?
What are you talking about?
.
Brother Migs!
"If you're always like that,"
-Why?
What are you going to do?
.
-I will really leave you!
...as her husband.
Brother!
Brother!
Oh no...
"Where are we going, sir?"
Do you know the way to Makati?
I'm lost.
I don't know...
I don't know how to go.
Bring me there.
Don't you have a car?
.
I'm Pacio by the way.
You're the one who cured my wife.
But she's doing fine now.
"But I really ran after him, sis."
I have searched almost the whole block but I really didn't see him anymore.
You chased him?
.
Then why didn't' you reach him?
What if something bad happens to him?
"Okay, change your clothes now okay?"
.
Hello?
"Hello, everything is fine here."
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good.
Hold on a second.
- One minute.
They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know?
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
"One's here, the other's there."
"Wait a little, just wait."
"I don't know, do something."
Follow them.
Follow them?
I said they got into the cab and left.
"Good, okay."
Hello?
Uluc?
I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
"Besides, why did you come here?"
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!
(sighs)
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.

(SCOFFS)
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
(sighs) I gotta do this.
I gotta do this.
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.
Just a tad.
He won't even know I was here.

You just scared the hell out of me.
"Sorry, I..."
"I was just, I was..."

Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
Any other little tidbits of information
You'd like to share with us?
No.
"No, at least I don't think so."

Hello.
Guess where I am?
"You know,"
"This really isn't a great time,"
Lemme call you back.

I don't know.

RAY:
How do you get your shit?
"I said, where does he live, bitch?"
If we told anybody where Marco lives he'd kill us.
"Well, what the fuck do you think we're going to do, huh?"
Leave us the hell alone!
Don't hit her like that.
Please tell him and everything will be okay.
Jackie don't know.
I deal with Marco.
She don't.
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.
MARCO:

- What's it called?
"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.

Is not a story.
Is a request.
May I use your communications equipment?
Communications...
"-Aye, free."
And we'II take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
-For now.
-Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
I acted foolishly as well.
"No hard feelings, aye?"
I'II buy you a refreshment.
"please, allow me."
I shall buy you a refreshment.
"No, no, I'II buy you one."
I insist.
"No, I must buy you one, to make amends."
It's all right.
I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will buy."
-I'II buy.
"-No, I will."
-I will.
-I will.
-Me!
Me!

"No, far from it."
"Fine, but Mr. Lloyd is not coming with us."
Period.
What do we do with the Atomium?
"I'm sorry, but do you have to do it right now?"
"Yes, it's very itchy."
Almost done.
I wonder how he feels.
He is probably in shock.
Wallonia broke off Belgium.
You can imagine his distress.
- Three papas.
- Shut up.
But it's true.
Kebab accident.
Border!
What the hell are you doing?
!
"Cheers, my friends!"
"The old generation, they want traditions, and we want fusion."
Coming!
- Hi!
- How are you?
"Hello, my dear."
Who are these people?
Who are all these guests?
"Mother, they are from Belgium."
They have to get to Sofia.
"They need a bus, can you imagine?"
A bus?
Here?
- Or a taxi.
- There are no taxis here.
"I also do life insurance, taxes and hot tubs."
"...just, huh... email."
Brother Amaar?
Baber!
"I need to get to city hall, fast!"
- Let's do it!
- Thank you!
Go!
[ Tupper is humming. ]
[ Tupper is whistling a song. ] Ready?
Hey!
[ He keeps humming. ]
"Hey, Baber!"
You can't park here.
"Tupper, we have no time right now."
We are here on official business.
"Amaar, let..."
You can't...
"Oh, hey!"
"Buddy, buddy!"
Hold on!
Hold on!
"Look at this, huh?"
"A 9/11 in progress, right there, my friend."
Caught him red-handed.
- That's a code blue!
"- It's not a 9/11, Fred."
Calm down.
"You can refresh your computer as often as you'd like, but an email from Charles isn't going to magically appear."
[ The computer dings. ] Oh!
Charles just emailed.
He'll call me in ten minutes.

Yeah!
"Fellow, you're late!"
You're late!
"The last 15 minutes... have been a fucking rollercoaster of emotions for me, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I fired up some of this shit.
"Fire up my fucking nose, yeah?"
But there you are.
"It's okay, Henry."
You just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
"But first, did you bring the flower?"
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
"But since you don't have it,"
I'm gonna need that kiss.

Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I..."
Which is why this is gonna hurt.
-(BONE breaking) -(screaming)
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles...
You make a good Batman.
"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?
"- Um, I don't know what that means."
- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
"Hello, this is..."
"Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin."
Professor Gregory Larkin.
Answer the phone.
I'm sleeping.
- Hello.
- Hello?
"- Yes, is Professor Larkin there?"
- Who?
"I mean, is Professor Morgan there?"
- Barely.
Who's this?
- This is Gregory Larkin.
I'm a professor in the math department at Columbia.
I was just calling to see
- how you are tonight.
- I'm fine.
How you are?
Fine.
"I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me, but I sat down in one of your classes."
And I was very impressed.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
Hold on.
- Wait.
Could you talk louder please?
- I sat in on your class.
- Hold on.
Don't go away.
- I was impressed with your teaching.
I was hoping we could have dinner Saturday.
I can do this!
"- Hello, can you hear me?"
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- Please...
- What?
It's 7-4-6-3.
Can you remember?
Everything's all right.
It's all right.
It's okay.
"- Go, go..."
- Okay.
Can you keep your pressure on it?
Okay.
- Did we do it?
- I think so.
- Will I die?
"- No, you can live a long time like this."
I need a doctor.
Can you take the bullet out?
It's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg.
Here.
This is gonna take the pain away for a while.
Wait.
"I'm gonna wake up, right?"
I've seen four guys get shot in the gut.
Every one of them lived.
Not the bullet.
You.
You wouldn't...
What?
"You wouldn't do that to me, would you?"
No.
- Somerset Textiles.
- Blackleg Miner.
- Send them in.
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, come on."
Hats off.
"Well, what do you want?"
Why aren't you at your work?
"Well, Mr. Thompson, sir, we wanted to ask you."
Please don't fire Miss Griffith.
Get back to your work.
"- But, Mr. Thompson, please--"
"- Get back to your work, I said."
This is no Boy Scout camp.
Those days are over.
This is a reformatory.
Now get back where you belong.
You can't do that.
Oh.
Can't I?
"Now the rest of you boys, get out of here."
You stay.
I'll show you what I can do.
- Watch that door.
- Okay.
"It don't work, huh?"
Shh.
"Not so much noise, you guys."
Are you crazy?
We got enough food here to feed all the kids in the dormitory.
Shh!
Here comes somebody.
- It's Charlie.
- Get away from that door.
- Open up!
You guys were gone a long time.
Where's Franz?
What's she doing here?
She wanted to call the police for her Franz.
"You almost sunk us all, you and your Biberkopf."
- Where's Franz?
- The cops got him.
That's a lie!
Shut her up!
It's not true!
"Henschke, we'll be gone a few days."
I'll tell you the address.
Quiet!
You're coming with us.
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
Buy my little gadget!
"Peep, peep, peep The dickey bird sings"
Let me outta here!
- Push him out!
- He squealed on us!
"Well now, Mr. Biberkopf!"
Welcome back.
You were gone a long time ― three weeks.
You boiling some punch there?
Have a look.
I'm not buying that.
It's gauze for bandages.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Me?
Paula.
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
[Baby Crying]
[Clicks]

[Yawns]
"Mmm, that crazy kid."
[Chuckles]
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
[Yawns]
Where's the keys?

[Gasps]

[Yawns]
Your scrapbook is like you- a mess.
"Gimme my pants, will ya?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds- Mulderig and Klein.
[Groans]
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys... and they can get all they want from ""Uncle Sap."""
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
"[Man] Mike, take a look at this blue one with the tan, on the right."
- Try a practical demonstration.
- It's a good idea.
Go forit!
Hurry.
- Waiter?

"You have to say ""oway""."
He's here.
We'd Iike to order...
We'da like...
"I don't understand a word, I'm Venetian, been here fortwo months."
Are you alright?
I Ieft you so many messages.
Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."
- I have to reorganize everything.
- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!
- How well I know you.
- I'II be back in two weeks.
Taste the pastiera.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
I heard a woman's voice.
"- It's Maria, my neighbor."
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.
- You shut up.
Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.
"Dick, you have the floor."
You have the floor.
What?

"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always--"
"No, no, sing it!"
"No, I'm sick of singing!"

"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!"
"Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
Just let me go!
Go ahead... make my day.
"You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red handprints all over your face."
Ahgghgh!
"Oh, my God, what was that?"
!
Did you see that?
!
"Oh, my God, it hurt so bad!"
Agh!
"What the ""h"" is going on?"
!
What are you doing?
This is crazy!
"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
So I can break this set up?
You mean from the other shot?
So like--
TRENT HAAGA:
Yeah.
-We're very late.
We're never gonna get a movie.
I'm just worried--
You're absolutely right.
Can we [inaudible]?
DAVE:
So I get from here to here.
Is that it?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Hey, Hasan."
Thank you.
That was great.
Thank you.
"Hang in, though."
We can still use you as the super stud that you are.
[Laugh]
"And we may need you as Toxie, too."
"Now, why is he getting out of the costume?"
Because he might be-
- I guess we got the real Toxie.
"Yeah, you're right."
WOMAN:
"I mean, I can put him back in it."
"Nah, it's all right."
Just stay handy.
"And we'll keep doing this, I think."
Like tomorrow we ought to do it also.
"Hello, Nina."
Take her to interrogation 819.
"Yes, sir."
What's the security configuration?
"Don't worry about it, Jack."
We're handling Nina.
"Ryan, you know what she's capable of."
That's none of your concern right now.
I'm sending you to medical to get checked out.
I'm fine.
I don't think you are.
What's this about?
We found evidence you've been injecting heroin.
"Tell me I'm off here, Jack."
Tell me I'm wrong.
I didn't think so.
"Ryan, I haven't missed a step."
I'm fine.
I have to cover my ass.
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.
- Kim.
- Yeah?
I thought you'd want to know your dad's back.
What about Chase?
"Uh, he's a few minutes behind."
Thank you.
Kim.
Dad.
"Oh, god."
Hi.
She's here.
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
Why?
"Somebody's got to be a grown-up, and clearly, it's not you."
Uh... grown-ups drink.
I've been seeing someone.
Like...
A shrink?
Like a guy.
Who?
You don't know him.
And he doesn't drink?
He's been sober for 15 years.
Sounds horrible.
Wait.
Is that whose car is out front?
Yeah.
I'm on a waiting list for one of those.
How'd he get it?
He's a dealer.
Drugs?
Cars.
Asshole.
"So, where is he?"
He took the boys for a bike ride.
He's alone with the boys?
So?
"So you're giving me shit about my parenting skills, and some total stranger is off with..."
he's not a total stranger.
Yeah?
"Well, how well do you know this guy?"
Well.
How well?
Well enough that we're getting married.
I knew it.
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.
"It is you that's been smoking too, isn't it?"
Wha...?
"Wait, what does that even matter?"
Have you...?
!
Have you been smoking?
No.
"No, I haven't."
I talked to Neil.
I told him.
He said I could stay at his boat for a while.
Excuse me?
Now you're moving out?
"- You're, like, leaving me?"
- No.
"No, I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to..."
Aren't we gonna deal with this?
Don't you wanna find some way for us to work through this?
"I assumed that when I told you, you would want me out."
Is that what you want?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
WOMAN 1:
You're doing a great job.
"Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget."
Hi!

"- Hi, boys."
"I'm Mrs. Roberts, and this is Officer Gardner."
How are you doing?
- This yours?
- No.
"- Well, how about I leave it here just in case it is?"
- Whatever.
"- Is your dad home, boys?"
- Why y'all here?
- Let's go inside.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- It's all right.
"- Look, I told you y'all can't be here, okay?"
It's just scars.
Chicks dig scars.
I love scars.
Now here we go.
"Oh, wonderful."
You're doing very good.
What?
"What's that, Larry?"
Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!

"No, not there."
Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.

Suspicious.
What is?
Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.
Aahhh!
I've been caught.
What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
We are here to see--
- What is his name?
We're here--
- Vagina.
"No, we're here to see Raza."
OK.
Follow me.
"Thank you, ma'am."
"We'll follow...you, I guess."
"Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk"
"She got it, she got it"
"She got it, she got it"
"- Hey, guys."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Raza!"
- What?
What's up?
- Kumar and Roldy?
"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
- Think about it.
Think about it on your own.
You're Seigaku's pillar of strength.
Stop kidding around.
Echizen's not coming again today?
What did you hear about it?
Don't worry about it?
Looks like he came to school though.
What happened?
Is it a cold?
It is a cold.
"- Ne, ne, ne, did something happen to the chibi?"
- Ah...
What do you mean something happened?
- It wasn't easy coming here.
- Then what do you want me to do?
At least help me a little.
The age of Kanto will continue tonight.
"Ryoma, let's have a game."
- Don't want.
- Good.
Heh?
"Oi, Ryoma."
"{\pos(192,242)}I'm bored."
What's up?
"{\pos(192,242)}Why?"
"Ya, they want those training camp."
Why?
"{\pos(192,242)}Sure."
"{\pos(192,242)}See you then."
"Mum there's still one more week, right."
I understand.
Yes.
Yes.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
- All okay.
- Yes father.
Shall we go?
Bravo!
What?
Scared of all these men?
No normally there's always a bunch of beggars outside the temple.
Minister Pradhan's sent us.
We're here to take you to ACP Pradhan's farm house.
Come quietly or else we'll beat you up.
No.
I am scared.
I'm frightened.
Look at this I'm getting goose-bumps.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Boss.
Run!
Jump.
You jump.
Tell me something will anybody be at home?
Daddy the Boss is here all alone.
Where are our goons?
Hello sir.
I could've pulverized your goons back there.
But then I had a brainstorm.
I left those rascals back in those lanes.
And I came visiting your home.
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!
Run!
Let's go together.
I taught you to fight.
Watch out!
You have come back?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Fantastic!
Still fighting!
[Jessie] What's going on?
- Are you Richard Sammler?
- l am.
We have a warrant.
is there another computer?
"- No, just the kids'."
- Take that too.
- [Jessie] My report!
- Sweetie.
What are you looking for?
"It's in the warrant, read it."
Have your family stand aside.
- Can they do this?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my God."
"- Hey, watch it!"
"Sir, listen, stand aside now."
[man] into the back bedroom.
"Look, Rick, I've just come from the DA's office."
Where you've been spending a lot of time.
Mason Gould is on 3.
- The opportunity to clear your name.
- On TV?
- You didn't know about the bribes?
"- No, absolutely not."
I want the two of us to face this like people who love each other do.
I can't do that right now.
Ripped By mstoll
Go!
Go!
Go!
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
I think I'm really hurt here.
"Help me, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, even out here, right?"
"Someone always does, eventually."
"I'm sorry I hit you, man."
"I'm really sorry, man."
"What were you doing, running in the middle of the road, anyhow?"
Can I move my...
No.
Bug out of here.
"Hey, stop."
I need help.
I'm down here.
Get off me.
You look pretty tasty.
Get away from me.
I think I'll start with your eyes.
Get away from me.
"Yum. ""Ant-solutely"" delicious."
"Please, don't hurt me."
"You're a real mess, my friend."
"I mean, seriously racked up."
Please.
Save your strength.
That would be my advice.
You'll need it.
Help me.
"You'll be all right, fellow."
Just lie still.
I think I'm paralysed.
Can you...
You'll be all right.
"- Pop that shirt off, and we'll start punching."
"- Oh, my God."
Really?
"- Yeah, man."
Every time I'm gonna take...
- Why can't you just take it off?
- Just take it off.
- You're ruining the moment.
- What is with you and the moment?
You know what?
Forget it.
Forget it.
- Who do you want to punch you first?
- I don't care.
- That was good.
"- Well, you caught me off guard."
That was a big part of it.
- That was the same spot.
"The same, exact spot."
- Yeah.
"Charlie, if we keep this up, you're gonna be... the best underground street fighter ever, bro."
- Okay.
Okay.
Deandra.
- Just 10 more minutes.
"- No, no."
That's it.
"Dee, that's..."
- I love it.
I need more of it.
It's dangerous.
Enough.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
Do you remember the coat?
- No.
- You do so!
You used to keep it spotless except for your dandruff.
- I didn't have dandruff.
- You did so!
"After you bought it, you stopped trying... to get me to go into the fields with you."
"It was the best contraceptive... ever invented, that coat."
It's in the attic.
How are ya?
"How are ya, Sharon?"
I'm pregnant.
Did I tell yous?
Ha ha ha!
"Yeah, well, I am."
She's bleedin' serious!
"- Well done, Sharon."
"- Thanks, Jackie."
"Yeah, Sharon."
Congrats.
"Thanks, Mary."
"Well done, Sharon, ya thick bitch, ya."
"Jesus, though, Sharon."
I know.
"It's terrible, really."
"- How long you gone, Sharon?"
- Sixteen weeks.
You don't look it.
I do.
I won't argue.
You're the expert.
I'm only messin'.
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody

You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
"Crazy, this."
"One red one you eat, another you don't."
"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?
!
I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me on his own accord
Gave it to you?
"It's true, you don't believe me?"
Grab him
"Hey, don't move!"
You really want to fight?
"Kid, you do know some kung fu!"
This kid must be the apprentice of Zhou Sanzhao
We'll take him to Thunderstorm!
"Wait, Thunderstorm is my Master!"
How come he has an apprentice like you?
Who's that?
Who are you looking for?
Master Shi
Master!

"Master, it's me!"
It's Gao Jian!
"Gao Jian, what happened?"
"Master, I...they..."
What exactly has happened?
"Master, these three assholes"
"I told them I'm your apprentice, they ignored me"
(Laughing)
You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."

He raised me.
"I want to graduate, find a good job, and repay my Grandpa."
Hey.
Kick me.
Come on.
With all your might.
Are you OK?
Your posture is good.
You can learn ShaoIin Kung Fu.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu?
I want to spread the art of Shaolin.
It was my Grandpa's dream.
OK...
I can try.

If you try Iacrosse.
Alright!
Yeah!
Come!
Wait!
What's lacrosse?
The future is veiled in darkness.
"Reach out to it without fear, and you will see light."
Do not stop.
Do not hesitate.
Accept the challenge.
The possibilities are infinite.
Set your inner power free!
Get it all!
"I am Yuichiro Ooba, President of Seikan international University."
I'm speaking to all our present and future students.
Our university will support your...
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.
"- No, not for me."
ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
GIANT:
Hogarth.
(WHIMPERS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
"Nautilus to Rogard, missile armed and ready."
"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.
Attacking him is triggering a defense mechanism.
"Don't listen, General!"
Destroy the monster while we still have the chance!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"General, you shoot and the whole thing starts all over again."
- Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
"- Orders, sir?"
"Which is why you have got to stop, General!"
- It's getting closer!
"Orders, sir?"
- Don't shoot!
"-Uh, substitute coach Roth."
DEAN:
Yes.
Miss Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Miss B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous--
[BLOWING WHISTLE]
-Take a lap.
-But--
[DOOR CLOSES]
Go nuts.
[STUDENTS CHATTERING]
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Find anything?
"Been over the entire school twice, no sulfur."
"No sulfur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
"-I don't know, maybe I was wrong."
-It happens to the best of us.
"We hit the road, huh?"
"But after lunch, it's, uh, sloppy-joe day."
[BOY SCREAMS]
[GROANING]
"Good hustle, Colby."
Walk it off.
[WHIRRING]
TEACHER:
"Always make sure that your cover is securely fastened, Jamie."
"Hey, I need to copy your Algebra homework again."
What was that?
Great!
Awesome!
What do we do?
No!
Jason!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"

NATHAN:
Oh.
"So are you here as, like, a guest, or, like, his date?"
"Oh, I hate that."
When you don't know if you're a date.
"Police, stay!"
Told you to stay!
My father may have Alzheimer's now.
He was awesome in South Asia 30 years ago.
You playing me?
I can't find the guy.
I give you 2 days to find him.
Or you are dead.
That's it.
What's wrong with you?
You've never listened.
Go to the toilet.
You too?
What the hell?
What?
"Look, numskull!"
You hit a cop?
How dare you are?
It's a tiger head.
Should have said so.
Forget it.
Let's go...
"Hey, who are you looking for?"
Someone with a scorpion tattoo.
Scorpion Yong?
I know where he is.
Let me go.
Wasn't that an intense toilet experience?
Intense?
Come later and I could have died.
"Well, you're the one who needed the toilet."
I asked you to come along.
Please.
"Good, together."
Why didn't you shoot?
-And you?
It's much worse for him to live like this.
You'd do him a favour by killing him.
That the bastard's ending like this...
-Excellent.
Couldn't be better.
Can I do anything for you?
"-No, I don't need any help."
I could buy the collected works of Marx and Lenin from you.
They're for my son when he graduates.
He'll never read them.
-You don't know that.
Elinor?
Marianne.
"Marianne, I do believe you're better."
"Yes, I feel better."
(CARRIAGE APPROACHES)
How long have I been in bed?
I don't even know.
"It is ten o'clock, exactly as the Colonel promised."
Mama is here.
Mama?
"Oh, Mama!"
Do not excite yourself... for her sake.
Elinor!
"Oh, my darling, are we in time?"
You're smiling!
"- Oh, Marianne."
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
All right.
He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.
Was that Vlad?
"I am going to smash your face in, you fucker!"
Why did you say Elena ran away?
Are you mad?
"It wasn't me, I said nothing."
Must be the Shark!
"He's a good guy, he wouldn't have squealed!"
"I swear it's not me, Niko!"
Word of honour.
Tell the girls to get ready.
"Tonight, I want them to work flat-out."
I see them.
Do you see them?
- Yes.
Great.
There are five...
"No, six."
Take their pictures.
Hurry up!
"- Yes, I'm hurrying."
- Is it OK?
Wait...
On the bridge on the right there.
I can't believe it.
It's Ronaldo.
Do you see him?
- Wait.
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
The sign says 'Booneville. '
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?
- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
YOU CAN COME AND VISIT.
YOU WANT TO GO OUT AND PLAY?
YES.
GO.
"PRAMOD, PRAMOD."
"No, you've already had some."
Go away!
"Come on, Pramod."
You have to go to class.
- They want to meet you.
- Me?
What do you mean?
- They want to meet you.
- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish.
He wants to shake your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.
"- Let him come, I'll shake his hand."
- They want you to go to Copenhagen.
"I know what he wants, but I'm not going there."
"""This is the cat..."""
"""...that killed the rat."""
It's not possible.
I can't leave the kids.
"""That lay in the house..."""
"""...that Jack built."""
Pramod has a birthday soon.
"It's not possible, Mrs. Shaw."
"""That worried the cat..."""
Why?
"Oh, Carol."
"Oh, God!"
"Hey, Jack."
Amy told me the good news.
"In my culture, when two people start dating, you give them a present."
They're condoms.
"Hm, I really thought these would have wrappers."
You seem to be enjoying this.
Nice to see cocky Jack Gordon uncomfortable for once.
Yeah.
Especially because of that secret you have with Jack.
[laughs]
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Oh, I think you do."
A real challenge... delicious!
Just tell me what happened.
Sex?
Rehab?
Embezzlement?
Sex?
Animal fighting?
Hit and run?
Sex?
Roland's secret son?
"Damn it, woman!"
You're showing no emotion!
How is this possible?
!
I'm British.
"I think the real question should be, Mason, why the obsession with secrets?"
Who betrayed you?
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
Come with me.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Do you dance?
"Oh, but the treatment."
Try this.
"Oh, that's wonderful."
Try it again.
Turn around.
(MUSIC STOPS)
But what about the treatment?
"Oh, I know what great lovers you Frenchmen are."
Kiss me.
"Oh, that's good."
You!
What are you doing with my wife?
"Uh, massaging the scalp."
"Oh, oh, pardon moi."
The jacket.
It's very warm here.
The jacket.
"Merci beaucoup, mademoiselle."
I ought to kill you for this.
(GRUNTING)
If you lay one...
"If you lay un hand on me, you know what I will do?"
What?
I'll bleed.
Au revoir.
"If I ever see your ugly face again, I'll kill you."
I want you to get out of town and stay out.
"(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, all right, but I can't leave from up here."
Is there anything else?
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
No.

Probably.
Okay.

"That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.
They stole my star.
They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz, and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.
I was important.
The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment, him and his lady head-shrinker."
There were no female doctors on Alcatraz.
Let's go.
Both of you.
Where?
Sunset Beach.
The location of the land mines are hidden in the lyrics of the song.
He painted the mines to blend in with the sand.
That's where we'll find Hauser.
Or what's left of him.
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.

This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.

Almost there.

You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.
Henry.
His memories are still catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."

I just want to help.
"But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going."

"- Yeah, that would be great."
"What'd you say, ma'am?"
Mm-hmm.
How could I?
With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.

What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
Ah.
I think our table is ready.
"We should just sit right down, I think."
"Yes, thank you."
To the buzzer.
A Sports Illustrated moment.
I actually think I got hit by Kobe's sweat when he took the shot.
Nice.
You still down for hanging out?
Sure.
"Uh, do you..."
you know a bar around here?
Let's skip the bar.
Too many drunken fans.
Fine by me.
What did you want to do?
Let's get out of here.
Take a drive up Mulholland.
- Mulholland?
- My girlfriend's out of town.
- I don't have a curfew.
Hop in.
"Lt'll be fun, I promise."
That is a beautiful watch.
I have three sons and a brother.
Always looking for good gift ideas.
- Where did you buy it?
- Fred Segal's.
- Oh.
- Did their Christmas display last year.
An homage to 1940s noir.
Hm.
"Jack, grab this chair."
We'll meet you downstairs.
"All right, there we go."
You okay?
I'm getting lots of experience at this.
"First, Detective Medavoy, now him."
SlPOWlCZ:
You holding up okay?
ERNIE:
Yeah.
"- Jack, just set the chair there."
JACK:
All right.
SlPOWlCZ:
Thanks.
- No problem.
SlPOWlCZ:
All right.
"James, you want to give me a second here?"
"Sure, let me get the paperwork."
You okay?
Yeah.
"You got my card, you know, if you feel like talking."
You feel like talking?
"I can't remember most of it, being over there."
I don't want to remember it either.
SlPOWlCZ:
Good luck.

"Counselor, can I have a word with you in private?"
I want us to be square about that fish.
"Andy, I don't think we're going to make it."

Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.

Are you alone?
May I come in?
- Bye.
Who is it?
- It's me.
Why did you come here?
Did anyone see you?
I took the backside stairs.
None saw me.
An important matter.
So...
"Whatever it is, you should have just called me."
Varun is here.
In Erode.
- Varun?
The chef from Chennai.
So what?
He might have come for some official work.
No.
He has come searching for you.
They have seen you at the hotel with Vikram.
I heard the girl with him address you as 'Vasundhara.'
Then they followed you in a car.
I diverted them.
I think they know everything.
They come targeting us.
We shouldn't take further risks.
Drop Vikram.
Let's go.
What?
Listen to me.
Let's leave this right here and go.
"This won't work anymore, Vasundhara."
You always talk negatively!
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Marion!
Hang on.
Don't...
- Indy!
- Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
- No.
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.
Big and ugly.
"Man, this case is just getting better and better."
"If Taggot picked her up, she's probably at his place."
Doubtful.
He's married.
I know.
Right?
Why don't you take the lead on this one?
- Really?
- Sure.
What are you doing?
"Uh, exercise."
I'll meet you up there.
We just need to ask you a few questions about last night.
I'm a little drugged.
Pain killers.
Right.
"Well, this won't take long."
How well do you know off--
How well do you know Officer Taggot?
- Who?
- Officer Taggot.
He your boyfriend?
"No, no."
Then why did he pick you up last night from the hospital?
"That's right, we know about that."
He just--he felt bad that I got hurt.
"Valerie, hey, whoa!"
Focus...
Don't worry about it.
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.
Ignore that.
Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Do it!
Aah!
My gosh!
In your face!
That is bullshit!
"No, no, no, that is such bullshit."
"Let's go again, double or nothing."
"Double or nothing, let's go again."
- Let's go again.
"- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy."
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.
"Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?"
You don't have to be a pussy.
"And he's, like, so cranky."
He's so cranky.
Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy...
"Keep talking, Freddy."
Keep talking.
"- Jesus, calm down."
- Keep talking.
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Apologize to the lady.
"Repeat, we are at Code Red."
Recon plan Charlie.
Execute!
Let's move!
"Move, move, move, move!"
Yeah!
"Okay, come on, kids."
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
"All right, gangway, gangway."
And this is how we find out what is in those presents.
"Okay, who's hungry?"
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue!
What in the world...
Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
"Hey, these guys are professionals."
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
"Okay, everybody, come on."
Everybody settle down.
"Now, kids."
Everybody...
You sit in a circle.
"No, Andy."
It was a brilliant fight.
And then I fell?
I suppose I swooned away like a woman.
You were overcome by...
the violence of what you'd done.
You're a sensitive man.
It was very hard.
- I remember the gun was shaking so.
- You see?
You're stronger than you knew.
And I thought you needed me.
But I do need you.
Drink your milk.
Where are the others?
They've gone.
- Gone?
- Mm-hm.
But how will we get back to Paris?
Why don't we stay here for a few days?
It's peaceful.
It's discreet.
Chopin.
Do you love me?
"God help me, I do."
You are superb.
Don't.
What is wrong?
I'm frightened.
Of me?
Certain acts are unseemly.
They are unsuitable.
Chopin.
"And if we're going to survive it, we can't turn on each other."
We're all we have.
I know.
I'll never do anything like that again.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
"Yeah, I forgive you."
(engine starting)
(tires squealing)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
(crying)
We broke up.
WOMAN:
Hello?
SHUTTER CLICKS
"What do you want, pig?"
Can I trust you to pass this on?
What have you got?
"Sorry, are you married?"
I live alone.
Oh.
Liz Fletcher.
"Do you ever go in the loft, Mr Moss?"
I rarely venture beyond the ground floor.
Peggy?
Where the hell are you?
"You shouldn't really be here, Len, You know that, right?"
You're retired.
Argh!
SQUEAKING
KNOCKING
"Come on, she's out."
Karate-chop me or something!
That is not...
Okay.
All right.
Let's just do one simple move.
Okay.
"Now, this won't wrinkle my top, will it?"
Ohh!
Wow.
That was actually fun!
Show me one more time.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you again.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Back up.
Again?
"Oh, yeah, when we almost got killed,"
I thought I lost my phone.
It was really scary.
"Mentos-pramp-climb, test number two."
"Lesson learned... when pressure builds to dangerous levels, it must be released."
Is your lip getting better or your face getting redder?
Just gonna pop into the family room.
What the hell was that?
!
"Oh, I'm just getting started!"
Ohh!
Why do you have to be such a silly...
"Haley, stop!"
Mom!
"Phil, honey."
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Hmm.
Who's next in our little contest?
Oh.
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff.
"Yeah, whatever."
Whoop.
"Pshh, pshh, pshh."
You had your chance.
"Now, then..."
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
"Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come."
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy."
I've got three little ogres at home.
[Muffled Screaming]
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Shh.
[Muffled Screaming]
[Man] Is somebody out there?
[Silenced Gunshots]
[Gunfire Continues In Distance]
Go.
"Go, go."
Give me your jacket.
- Go.
- Come here.
Come here.
Okay.
Go.
[Engine Starts]
[Radio Chatter]
[Engine Off]
[Man] You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. Government project... administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
Making sure we haven't blabbed to them.
"Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't."
Mmm.
Concealed weapon.
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.
"Let's go, guys."
You shoot Julio ?
I didn't cap nobody.
That's all right.
We'll get the bullet from autopsy.
"Well, when you do, get back to me."
Are we done ?
"Not quite, Luis."
What's that ?
That is your confession for another murder.
What murder ?
Bob Keaton.
Muzzle stamp's identical.
"Bob's chest, your gun."
800 or deal is off.
Then it's off.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Five.
I'll give you five.
Now you negotiate ?
"Luis, show him my counteroffer."
- I'm out of here.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
You killed him.
Julio's the boss.
"Maybe you took care of that, too."
"No, I swear."
I didn't.
And I was the one who saw him first.
"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.
- Don't be angry with me.
"- I'm not angry with you, Ursula."
I'm just gonna get the washing.
"No, no, I'll do it."
I'll do it!
"Oh, Ursula."
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
"Not cheap, is it?"
[Man]:
It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.
It's just as well.
[Men chattering]
[Dorcas]:
I want some pilchards.
[Man]:
No more left.
"What do you mean, haven't got any left?"
I did have half an hour ago.
"What have you done with it, then?"
All right.
Phyllis has got 'em up at the shed.
She'd better have.
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?
Stargazey pie.
What's the matter with coley fish?
- Who is slave?
"I am a soldier, too, please."
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
"Proud ox, where is your army?"
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him.
Now.
He's next.
- I'm waiting.
Will you speak?
- I don't know.
"Hold on, Mac, old boy!"
Stop.
Look.
"See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?"
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in.
He'll talk from there.
"- No, I can't stand it!"
- Will you speak?
All right.
"If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you."
Take me outside.
"- Be a man, Mac."
"- I can't go it, mates!"
"Come back, Mac, old boy!"
"- Well, Sergeant?"
I got you!
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!
Snakes!
"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
"It was not to be, chérie."
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!
Indiana Jones... adieu.
No!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Thank you.
"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
Indy!
Ow!
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
What are you doing?
For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
"If you do this well, there are more jobs coming."
"Doc, don't worry."
I won't break my promise.
Hey...
You can't charge your laptop here.
"Sir,"
I really need to download some work.
Just a little while?
Yes.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
I'm taking it doc.
Shit!
Damn it!
Only half an hour left.
Are you done?
Here.
Thank you.
Just half for now.
Tomorrow morning I will send you the rest.
You haven't finished it yet?
This is a big project.
"Je, what are you doing?"
I'm calling Jerd.
Why are you calling him?
Tomorrow you will get it.
Yoon.
"Je, don't call."
Send it now or we're screwed.
"Je, stop dialing."
You have another 50% to finish.
It's not...
Doesn't matter.
I don't have to.
"""Linden""?"
"Linden, that's from the ad agency."
What the hell's goin' on here?
I have nothing to say.
Crocker!
"You hold her down here, and you call the bomb squad!"
- [Ticking] - [Pounding]
[Pounding Continues] [Kojak] Karla Elliot?
Yes!
"Miss Elliot, open up!"
It's a police emergency!
Open the door!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Let me get my coat!
"Nothing personal, kid."
Come on.
[Crocker] Easy now!
Easy!
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]
All right!
Stand back!
"Now, look."
"If there's anyone in town that you wanna spend the night with, that officer over there will be very happy to take you."
What are you doing here?
- I knew.
- You what?
"Alex, is he all right?"
He wasn't even here.
He was out looking for you to help.
- Thank you for my life.
-As in left or died?
-Died.
"- Well, I'm very sorry."
- We were hunted down one by one.
All that they died for is this.
It's a Purean.
It contains a collective data of human progression as well as Draconian war plans.
Information that could be very helpful in our cause in overcoming them.
- And how are you gonna get that to your people?
- A rescue ship arrives tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
-At sun fall.
-So you're going home?
-No.
I'm not.
Turn left up here.
Your camera.
"-Your friend, is he..."
-From here?
No.
She's Arctorian.
- I don't think I've ever met an Arctorian before.
Is she part of this interstellar alliance?
-They are.
-Are they here to help us?
-Very much so.
-Good.
That's good.
-They're here.
-My God.
-This is Robert.
- The one you spoke?
Thank you

Coffee.

Is no big deal.
We just used up a little gas.
"Look, not a scratch oh, the starter needs adjusting."
"If you want me to fix it, I've got a screwdriver."
Go ahead...
Listen to their sob story.
You'll cry your heart out.
Wait...

Wait...
There's something you ought to know...
We had a run-in recently in a five-and-dime store.
So we're kind of on parole.

Poor slobs.
I'll put you in jail myself.

A candle?

Okay.
Now talk to me.
What was so bad?
I was in this room.
And it was red.
DAVID:
All right.
"- And there was no doors, no windows."
- Mm-hmm.
"And these curtains, they were on fire."
And I was in this corner.
Right.
"(STAMMERING) And I was looking out, and there was someone else there."
She was staring at me through the flames.
Then I woke up and...
"Well, hey, well, don't worry, all right?"
It was just a bad dream.

At your age.
You keep fit enough.
You're sweet.
I know you're not cheating on me.
I'd notice it in seconds.
You would?
How?
Everything.
I know you through and through.
Ab.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Talk to me.
"If you don't know, you can't tell."
Can't tell?
"Can't spill the beans, you mean."
We can never forget this.
We owe it to Arie.
Ab!
Hello!
-Wait a moment.
We've not seen each other for so long.
Come in.
I have to finish something for a party.
Before the children come out of the cinema.
You're a better grandpa than me.
"-Yes, but they're not my grandchildren."
They're my children.
-Oh.
Late happiness.
"No one, right?"
That's where people come in.
That what people see.
"No, this is the wrong..."
It's 0-3.
That's not 0-3.
You're pretty.
You have a pretty mouth.
"All the pretty girls in the hallway, you know?"
And you can come with me.
It's good.
You look good.Who the fuck?
Who the fuck?
It's gonna be a long day.
Nadia!
I look awful.
Can we try something new?
What kind of statement would you like to make?
Something that says... don't fuck with me.
Fuck!
Shit!
Perfect.
Just sprucing up for some marathon shmoozing.
"Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring."
I think you look perfect as you are.
Very funny.
It's nice.
It suits you.
Is it new?
You don't remember?
I was wearing it the night we met.

"We're all backwards, berta."

Our minds are primitive.
"Our minds are primitive, Berta."

"Ronon's been going up against the Wraith, one on one, for the last seven years."
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
And exactly how is he gonna do that?
I also have good hearing!
Right!
Carry on!
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I am not sure.
What do you mean?
"There is a presence here, but it is different."
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Dammit!
It's in there.
- It was a Wraith?
- Yeah.
- Did you see it?
- No.
"- Well, so how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female!
Ellia?
- Get out of the way!
- Please don't shoot!
She's not what you think!
She's my daughter.
She means you no harm!
Your only friend is me.
"If I conk out, you're dead."
"Here's my direct line, so you can't forget it."
"Give me a lead, fast."
That gang...
I want their names first.
"Nobody knows them, I swear!"
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.
So I know you're OK.
Good seeing you again.
How'd you get that?
It's nothing.
At work.
Why not tell me what you do?
I don't want to lose you.
"You get home late, leave early."
Lots of cops live that way.
Many wind up all alone.
What are you after?
Nothing.
I just do my job.
"Get up, lazybones!"
"- Say: ""Morning, Dad""."
"- Morning, Dad."
And give him a kiss.
No school today?
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.
"Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday."

"You guys were gonna set me up, huh?"
"Come on, Dalton..."
Let's get out of here.
I'll help you... come on.
"No, no, you get out of here."
Don't play hero with me.
Let's just go.
Damn it!
You get out of here!
I'll cover you.
"Oh, same old, same old."
You?
Yep.
- So where is Bethanne?
- She won't be coming back.
What happened?
Where is she?
"Well, you were right."
We shouldn't have left.
No.
Hungry?
"Next time, you'll listen to me."
I'm home.
"Teeth brushed, ready for bed."
Safe and sound.
"Oh, good, good."
I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
"No, no, no."
Uh...
Not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay?"
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
- Such a liar.
"- No, I'm serious."
"In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be."
I had a really nice time too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.
When actually life makes you suffer.
Get lost.
Bloody cripple.

The law rules the people here... follow only Ayushman Thakur.

You're right Raghunath.
No matter how polluted the water is... it always douses fire.
Ayushman Thakur.
Only abada** can deal with the likes of you.
I will call him and he'll come.

"Move, move, move!"
"Okay, behind the barricade."
"Get down, get down."
All right.
"Okay, steady, steady, steady, steady."
"All right, come to daddy."
"All right, there you go."
All right.
Got it.
Tanner!
"All right, get in there now!"
"We're coming, we're coming!"
Tanner.
"Tanner, come on, buddy."
Couple of things:
You just killed a good man...
And my legs hurt.
We translated your song.
We dug up every mine you planted.
Not every one.
"""Twin Tree""?"
That one went off 20 years ago.
How many people went with it?
Not a soul hurt.
- You're lying.
- Okay.
"I planted that mine on Mount Sutro, right on the trail everyone took to the top."
No.
Run for your life!
Oh!
Keep away!
- Take it!
- Keep away!
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!
Candy!
Yay.
Treats.
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, daddy!"
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad..."
"- Daddy, daddy, daddy."
You're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair!
"Oh, did you see?"
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"Oh, that's all right, sweetie."
Mommy didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think... someone's inside?
My God.
What...
You wouldn't want to be listening to that fella.
I only told you 'cause...
"I don't know why I told you, really."
You were right.
It's pathetic.
A grown man talking like that.
Exactly.
Just 'cause she's up the pole.
Exactly.
It's stupid.
Yeah.
You wouldn't want to be getting... worked up about it.
"Still, though..."
It's just...
I heard something.
I thought I should warn you.
- Warn me?
"- Yeah, warn you."
"You know your man, George Burgess?"
What about Mr. Burgess?
He was saying things.
Not to me face.
It was Lester who told me.
He was saying things... about you being pregnant.
What was he saying?
He said... he said you were a great little ride.
"So Lester says, anyway."
"Lester wouldn't make a thing up like that, would he?"
"Jesus, no."
Not Lester.
Mr. Crusoe.
I thought you'd forgotten us.
Are you going to be leading us?
I'll leave that to you.
Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
Lancaster.
Unshackle the men.
"Come on, let's go."
"Get up, Velasquez."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sots!"
They're in disarray.
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Fire.
Reload!
No!
"No, wait!"
Hold your fire.
One more shot and I kill her.
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
A night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
just stand still.
Papi!
Stop it!
"Papi, please stop!"
Shh.
Papi!
"Stop, stop."
I fucking love you.
I'm not going to let you do this to yourself.
"Be strong, be strong."
There you go.
There you go...
beautiful man.
"Viente nueve, trienta."
You got 30 pills here.
And you got the testosterone blocker.
Okay?
Otherwise you be growing a beard with tetas.
You don't want that.
That should take care of you for the month.
Anything else?
Um...
"Oh, you wanna get pumped... huh?"
You got the coins?
"Yo, damn, that needle's big."
I can't believe you doing this shit.
The price you pay for beauty.
"You want some, too?"
"I'm just here for moral support, mama."
You want anything on top?
"No, Papi would kill me."
"Okay, just the culo?"
- Did you enjoy the flowers?
That was it.
The flowers.
It had to be.
Roger had hidden the money here in the gardens where he used to work.
Magnum!
What are you tryin' to do?
Ruin me?
Turn around!
Turn around!
It must be the ruddy heat.
I saw it happen several times in India.
I remember once when the raja of Punjab was racing elephants... in July on the Tigris Plain.
There was this rogue bull.
"Come on, will ya, Higgins?"
He got behind the raja's elephant and tried to mount him.
"Uh, the elephant, not the raja."
Extraordinary.
Hold it.
"Hold it, T.C. There's his bike."
Magnum!
Let's split up.
I'm gonna go this way.
Okay.
Heliconia caribaea.
Fascinating.
In the north it's commonly now called lobster claw.
Alpinia.
Indigenous to New Guinea.
Marvelous.
Ah.
Alpinia oceanica.

What dirty text?
I didn't get any dirty text.

You like it like that.

You know this is material evidence.
Did I say it wasn't?
"Either we do this together, Minks, or every man for himself."
I'm hungry.
How about you?
I'll see you tomorrow.
As you like.

What's so damned urgent anyway?
Order me a beer at the bar.

Sorry.

You've had nightmares or didn't sleep at all.
Count with me from three to one.
"Three, two, one."
Good.
You can feel your entire body relax.
"Make some coffee, Viljanen."
"- Oh, is that what you call it?"
- Violet!
What?
"I almost forgot, I got something for you too."
Really?
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world of view.
Now you can share with others... in a new way.
"Thanks a lot, mister."
I need the police.
"Yes, that's my address."
What are you doin'?
He's writing a letter.
To who?
"To ""whom""."
To whom?
His daughter.
I'll do it.
What?
I'll write it for you.
Alright.
Thank you.
So where was I?
"""Dear April..."""
That's it?
"So far, yeah."
"""Dear April,"
"I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do."
In any case...
It's time we finally talk.
"Please, take care of yourself."
I managed to put some money in your bank account.
Is that paint?
"Yeah, looks like it."
"Hey, Gabby!"
"- Take a sample from her left fingers,"
- Left hand.
"Excuse me, Mr. Monk?"
I have a nephew.
He's ten years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man.
Really?
Kids!
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero."
"Sorry, Mr. Monk is working."
Maybe when he's finished.
- I'm sorry.
- Anything else?
"Clues, clues, scanning, scanning."
"No, that's it, all done."
You said something about an autograph?
That would be great.
Thank you so much.
I got.
Would you mind?
Would you mind?
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.
Your hair's in the way.
"Head down, head down."
Are you okay?
- She's fine.
- Could be a bad thing.
- Tara!
"See ya on ""Trisha""."
I was thinking of asking you to speak at the school.
Speak?
About drugs.
Speak about drugs?
To the kids.
Speak to the kids about drugs?
They need to hear about the harsh realities 'cause... people talk so much shit about drugs.
Yeah.
I know I do.
Half your sixth form come round here anyway.
You could call a register here some weeks.
"Ah, now, that's another good topic."
What's it like working from home?
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Well, the hours are terrible, but then I hardly do owt."
So it balances itself out.
"Jesus! ""Hellraiser III:"
"Hell On Earth""."
"- It's been a while, lads."
"- Been off on tour, haven't we?"
"- Been having some mad times, y'know."
Mad.

Looking forward to school?

A lot more going on there.
We've already collected a tidy sum.

Not much.
I have to go to the toilet.

Now you have taken my girls.
I haven't!
You don't have to deny it.
I understand!
Good!

Are you really good at kung-fu?
He's inferior to you!
Please excuse me!
Thanks!

Good...

Good fist!

- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!
Duncan Lloyd!
It's me!
Dragan!
OMG.
"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?
Get your camcorder and movie.

My friend.

How is she?
Who?

She's so-so.
What does that mean?
She's still in bed.
"She doesn't eat, she doesn't speak."
"Wait, I'll fetch it."
Here.
Just a second.
I'm tying my shoelace.
Good.
"You haven,t eaten, I hope."
- Nice trip?
- Us?
"We got lost at first, but after that it was easy."
"Here,s the paperwork."
"CIaudine, Jean-MicheI, against the wall, please."
Very good.
Now undress.
"That,s right - undress."
"Lab coats off, shoulders against the wall."
"Jean-MicheI, tell us how you met."
Me or...
"Sure, CIaudine."
"At some friends, dinner party."
"I hadn,t really noticed him."
"But at a certain point our eyes met,"
",cause we were both bored."
- You were bored?
- Yes.
THEY WERE BORED.
He smiled and then -
"It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but..."
I was surprised when he called me afterwards.

"No, not Iike this."
REFUSES TO SING
- How about you?
"- I don,t know it."
I can always make a new one.
I'd rather lose my engine than seeing it misused by a villain.
This is it.
Here I go.
"I do this and this, and then..."
"Professor, here we come!"
"Oh, no!"
Ouch!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Wait!
"He has the devil's luck, indeed."
Did you see that?
Two planes are leading.
Mac's and Hudson's.
Everybody's here.
Dear!
Helen!
Here.
Congratulations on your victory.
"Congratulations, Mac."
Thank you very much.
I owe my victory entirely to your kindness.
"No, it's due to your excellent engine."
Or perhaps to Mrs. Hudson's lunch basket.
"Oh, that may be right."
I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.
I bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
Ouch...
Shall we raise our glasses?
Cheers!
"Professor... we completely blew it, didn't we?"
A foreign lab?
"Actually, no."
"Garcia, isn't Annandale where Morgan and Hotch are?"
That's not a gas main explosion.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
Please pick up.
"Yeah, it's Morgan."
Hello?
"Garcia, can you hear me?"
We saw the explosion on TV.
"Yeah, I know."
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
"Oh, God."
Don't worry.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easy.
Do you need anything?
I know who to call if I do.
"Thanks, baby doll."
They're all right?
Yeah.
We lost a S.W.A.T. agent.
Son of a bitch.
Sorry about Kenny.
"Yeah, me, too."
The chatter was a set-up.
They knew we'd be listening.
They led us straight here.
Just tell me you know where to look next.
Not yet.
They're okay?
We were right about the trap.
"Three, judge."
"Thank you, judge."
Three for the judge.
Ten dollars.
I'll let you off with a light sentence.
Pair of nines.
Pair of dogs.
"I didn't know you had a twin brother, judge."
"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"
I suppose I ought to say thanks.
I don't know the party.
Ho!
[playing piano]
"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."
-Like;
"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.
"-Brock said he was lucky again, Papa."
-Really;
That's funny.
-Looks to me like the boys took him.
-They tried.
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
"Let's start by analyzing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Oh, yes."
Of course.
Would you like some tea?
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, no, thank you."
Would you like some?
No.
Are you sure?
It's very good.
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Stay away from me!
Ronon!
It's all right.
It's okay.
"They hate me, don't they, father?"
No.
"No, no, no."
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not going to change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
Yes.
Why?
They just found another victim.
I'm so sorry!
"- Don't worry, Jocelyn."
How do you know my name?
I don't know.
"This is Paul Rochester, Deputy Art Director."
Hello.

- Roxane Rochett?
"- Not that whore, the nail enamel!"
- Whore!
- What does it mean?
"It means fuck me, but respect me."
"Worship my body, but the upkeep is going to be costly."
"Stripe me, spurn me, treat me as your Spaniel."
I'm your dog and I'm gonna break the leash on you!
"- Calm down, Cornelia!"
Arf!

I need to see the epiglottis.

We have been looking for you.

(GUNS COCKING)
This is Factionless?
This is insane.
Tobias.
Mother.
(WHISPERING) I thought she was dead.
Me too.
Someone please tell me what's going on here.
Tobias' father was very abusive.
I knew the only way I could ever truly escape him would be to disappear completely.
Abnegation helped me fake my death.
Anything to protect Marcus' image.
But you just left him there alone with Marcus?
I was very young-
I reached out to him about a year ago.
I felt it was finally time to reconnect.
(LAUGHS)
- What the fuck?
- Come on!
"Down, set, go!"
TTD:
"There it is, right there."

"- Dude, run!"
Y'all take five.
Good play.
Take five.
- Come here.
- Where the hell are you throwing?
"Sorry, Rick."
You know what a skinny post is?
"Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?"
"Man, we don't even call plays at my school."
School?
What you... you in...
what school you go to?
- Miami-Dade High.
- You in high school?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Really?
I'ma really kick your ass if you don't get to step...
Get out of here.
"T, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
"We got Amendola, Gronk, and Edelman working with Brady."
On the road.
At the edge of town.
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.
Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.

It's Quini.

Can we go now?
You can leave.

- The youngest.
He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona...
- ...and my daughter's in France.
- Can you tell me what you saw?
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.

- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.

We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...

- Are you good?
- All right.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.

Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.

I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"
Head this way.
"What'd they say, 5 people on"
This floor?
"I said 5, 5."
Whoa.
"Hey, Bella."
Do you want to jump in bed?
Do you want?
OK then!
Zıplıyoruz bed!
See?
This place is not bad I said to you!
- What is Jade?
"- Hi, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where is it?"

So sendeymiş.
Wow!
You t.şaklıymışsın vulgar.
- I want $ 1 million.
- How about meeting me?
We'll talk.
"If I make it, die."
Statue when you die.
So I'll do this as follows:
I'll tell you the location of the transmitter.
Give me my money.
Then he'll tell you where to find the statue.
"You play a dangerous game, Mike."
You can not hide from me.
I promise you:
"The one you will not hurt, burn, Mike."
Do not have to do this to me.
Bring the money to the donor.
Then you get the statue.
"Okay, Jade?"
Look ...
Let's go.
Hail Mahadev!
Look.
I've already been punished for my crimes.
Let's end this enmity.
For that one needs to kill the enemy.
Understand!
Go on.
Kill him!
Catch him.
No matter what color you paint on black... it'll still remain black.
Raghunath.
He's already slipped out of our hands.
And now he's out of Satyakant Shashtri's life too.
Shiv.
Listen carefully.
Satyakant has just one son.
And that's you.
And you.
Satyakant.

"A busy day, huh?"
How is your aunt Shukran?
I want to visit heragain but she neverpicks up the phone.
She is still looking for a job.
I told her.
She could work here.
She can't...
Her new boyfriend is overly jealous.
Anyway...
Bitch.
Don't be late.
I hold yourroom free the whole day.

Two months ago.
"Oh, boy!"
What a time you're going to have!
Where'll you go?

A hotel...
Here...
Thas for you.
What for?
I'd like you to stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
"And Richard, you either tell me right now what's got your brother so riled up, or I end this goddamn thing right now!"

Stole Annie?
They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?

"MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks..."
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!

"- Steal Annie, will they?"
I'll break every Thug's back in India!

"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.
[ Laughs ]
"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.

A junkman who sells art or an artist who sells junk?
You tell me.
HOGARTH:

"My god, all the quim that isn't being used... and you keep jacking off."
"Confucius says: ""Pussy everyday gets old""."
Go to hell!
"Out, out, out."
Let's go!
"A dollar each, a dollar..."
"Enough, enough!"
Relax...
You want to screw her?
Impossible.
You want to be with her?
What's up?
I'll get the car.
I'll see if I can reach it.
I'm almost touching the water.
Careful!
Are you okay?
"I got it, pull me up!"
Estrella was wearing hose like those.
Freeze!
Stop!
Why are you running?
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?
- A baby deer?
- Roebuck.
- Where are you from?
- The town.
Get up.
- What's your name?
- Jesus.
"You and I met the other night at the fair, remember?"
My head still hurts from the gin.
- How did you get here?
- I walked.
- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.
See anyone go in or out of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.
"- You know, mooning about."
"Daydreaming, singing to herself."
"You haven't noticed, hmm?"
"Oh, well, I..."
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
[Gulps] Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
"- In love, hmm?"
"[Whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!"
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans?
What about humans?
Humans?
[chuckles nervously]
Who said anything about humans?
[yelps]
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
You'll see.
It's a surprise.
"Oh, Flounder."
"Flounder, you're the best!"
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
"[Giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?"
"Oh, this is all so... so sudden."
"- Ha ha, idiot."
This person must be mute.
"Saa, who knows."
I'm just too ignorant.
"Hey, you guys are noisy."
Na?
What did you say chibi?
The one you were talking about just now was the Eastern grip.
Eastern grip?
It's really common just for people like you.
Did you said something wrong?
How old are you?
- Junior High student?
- Middle School student?
Looks like you know a lot.
Get off the next stop.
Mada mada da ne.
Who's that?
Good afternoon!
Thanks for the hard work!
Oi chibi.
We are not recruiting.
Wait chibi.
What is your name?
I'm asking you for your name.
Could it be you are that transfer student named Echi something?
Answer me.
Echizen Ryoma.
So it is.
The prodigy from America.
Show me what you've got.
And you are?
I can fly?
"-Erik, please."
-The boy seeks the larger truth.
"If you want, must desire."
"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!
Bye!
Son.
Erik.
"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.
And we are all different part of life to know who is and what their gifts.
You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.
Got it?
"Yes, that's okay."
Great.
"-Will, what is this?"
It's the wave of change.
"The world is changing, Bill."
We have to get in on.
"My god, can not be."
Something somewhere gave the greatest hustle.
Something hit the land of the emperors.
"Come on, children."
Let's push the pace.
"-It's our time, Bill."
-Right.
"Swimming-and-death, my friend."
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
I would never betray you like that.
You're right.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
I...
I'm losing my mind.
It's all right.
We're partners.
We figure this out together.
You know what you are?
You're a nurturer.
Me...
I couldn't even keep my own little dog alive.
Little shit.
"All he needed was some food, a place to take a dump, pee."
Me?
"I just take, take, take."
So I have to take this.
Just...
Don't start crying.
Okay?
And don't kill yourself.
- Hey.
- Have you met her yet?
- Who?
- Audrey.
Your date.
Do you usually meet them first?
"Grace, if you want me to call this off..."
No.
I'm just curious.
"Sometimes I meet them, sometimes I don't."
Just seems so strange.
- Stronger.
- What?
[Scoffs] Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?
Will it show up on the test?
Will these narcotics show up on a drug test?
- Hey.
- What?
"Seriously, why don't we do this more often?"
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
[Knock on door]
"Uh, lieutenant, you got some visitors."
They're early.
My sister has ruined more nooners for me than the rest of the world combined.
You had a lot of these growing up?
How do you think I put myself through med school?
[Laughs]
"Come on, aunt Hallie."
It starts in five minutes.
"Uh-oh, what do we have here?"
VIP guests for the parade?
- Aunt Hallie!
- Hey.
"- Hey, Viv."
Hey.
- How ya doing?
- Can't complain.
- Good?
"- How's, um--how's your mom?"
- Viv.
"No, it's fine."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?
Ten minutes.
Hagman.
Perkins!
Cheeky bastard!
"- Which one, Cooper?"
"- Left, three o'clock."
That'll teach him.
"Sant'lago, saint of Spain, stand with the Chosen Men."
Sant'lago
- That's my boy!
"- Ha, ha!"
St James!
ALL St James!
De L'Eclin.
No shooting!
He's mine!
Who fired that?
"Me, sir."
"Give him yours, Harper."
"Chosen Man, Perkins."
"Take a tip, Perkins."
Give it back.
"Under Major Hogan's orders, I held Torrecastro long enough to effect an uprising."
I deemed my duty done and thought it prudent to return to await further orders sir
"You did damn well, Sharpe."
Napoleon will be in a fearful rage about Torrecastro.
Heads will roll.
Morale will suffer.
Which is all to the good.
"Because next month, I mean to cross into Spain and give Marshal Victor a damn good thrashing."
Pity about James Rothschild.
I presume
An error ..
"Lord, you mistake."
I was in the bathroom.
There I got the message.
What message?
"""Do not let your life."""
He said that he killed if it does not do what it says.
I can not afford it.
I can not let that happen.
I just what to do.
He killed my mother.
I killed them all.
All dead.
To Alice.
Please!
"If you fly, many will die and more innocent people."
People die every day but not my family.
"Please, this is crazy."
God knows what we can do.
What about him?
I'm sorry.
"Addons Ten minutes before impact, Mr. Calahan."
Do not.
Please.
Addons One listen to one of the poisoning helping our friend?
Or go back to the cabin Addons
- I keep my wife and kids?
Do not listen.
Addons
- Please.
- Who wants to die first?
Addons - wife or child.
- Let it be.
Let it be.
Seriously?
- Let it be.
Sure?
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
I am Xavier.
I hope you all know me.
You know me.
You must also know that for the past 20 years..

And for the first time in 20 years our company..
..has decided to work with Indian designers and stylists.
And whichever company's designs are selected..

But you have only ten days for this job.
So all the best.
But start the work tomorrow morning.

Alright?

"Point is, I'm a good guy."
"Oh, no, you're a bad guy, sweetheart."
But...
I keep your secret.
[Singsongy] Bad guy.
There's no secrets.
"See you later, bad guy."
Bad guys don't turn that down.
Okay?
[Under breath] Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
Watching my girlfriend.
I got some bad news.
Your girlfriend's marrying that creepy old dude.
That's just her Dad.
- She was kissing him.
- You kiss Dad.
Not like that.

"[Candy rattles, bowls thuds]"
I cannot tell you how excited my baby is right now.
So I'm not familiar with Jewish weddings.
Is there anything special?
A request you might have?
"We are far from traditionalists down here, Robin."
Just speak from the h... oh.
Dagnabbit.
- Oh.
Ready.
Start.
Don't look down on me!
Damned guy.
Mada mada da ne.
Go home.
Ku'so!
Ugh!
What the hell?
What you doing?
When did you come here?
"Anyway, get out."
"Scared you, didn't I?"
"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?
"- It hurts, it hurts."
You're early.
The English test turned out bad.
- No doubt about that.
It was horrible.
- I thought it was okay.
"I have high blood pressure, I can't take this."
Shame on you!
Inspector!
No toothbrush.
But we found 2 pineapples.
Where from?
From them!
"Help me get rid of them, quick!"
"- Get rid of them, sure!"
- Yes.
I meant the pineapples!
Inspector!
Inspector Robin!
I've been waiting for you!
For me?
What for?
- To be friends with you!
- Friends?
Do you mind if I sit on your bed?
Not at all.
You can do anything you like on my bed.
"Make yourself at home, feel free!"
I'm a very easy-going person!
- Inspector Robin!
- Just call me Robin!
"Robin, I want to...!"
What do you want to do with me?
I want to chat with you!
O.K. let's talk while we're still sober.
"Robin, I...!"
"Control yourself, Bridget!"
- Can I have a drink!
- Get some sleep.
- My car's in Grant Park with a flat.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.
I'll grab you a cab.
Come on.
- Guess I missed the opera.
- Linda will understand.
"- Here, take my coat."
- Thanks.
- Grab a bite?
- Yeah.
"- Oh, there he is."
- Dr. Ross!
Dr. Ross!
"- Over here, Dr. Ross."
"- Can we have a statement, Dr. Ross?"
- How are you feeling right now?
- Have you seen the rescue footage?
- How does it feel to be a hero?
- Just a moment of your time.
"Dr. Ross, just a moment of your time."
London.

Chaudhary Baldev Singh?
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Why are you here?
Do I have a reply?
See you then.
"Dennis, I have an idea."
"- Well, this is awesome."
- Yeah.
This is amazing.
There's blood everywhere.
It's beautiful.
"Yeah, and we were totally right."
These guys don't have technique.
They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other.
Look at all this money being thrown around.
"- Dude, we gotta get in on this."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating."
- Yeah.
Get up!
You know who can take a really good beating?
- Charlie.
- Charlie.
Here she is...
The old gym.
Smell that?
- That's the smell of hard work.
- And feet.
That's the smell of big dreams.
The smell of glory.
- It smells like feet.
- And feet.
Does smell like feet.
- Frank?
"- Oh, shit."
Frankie Fast Hands!
"-Well, then, let's climb aboard."
"-No, no, no, wait, Buzz!"
Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative.
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
"-Yeah, bu..."
Buzz!
Buzz!
"That's two lefts and a right, huh?"
"-Thanks for the directions, okay?"
-Yeah.
"And remember, kid..."
Buzz!
It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.
What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift-off is scheduled for
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for immediate pizza...
Sheriff!
There you are.
"Now, the entrance is heavily guarded."
We need a way to get inside.
"Great idea, Woody."
I like your thinkin'.
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
Now!
Over.
Copy that.
Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?
I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together.
We're still working it out.
"Oh, he's a good cop, apparently."
It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."
- Approaching now.
- Copy that.
Wait till he's past the jetty then head in with the light on.
What's he doing?
"Oh, Jesus."
Police!
Stop!
"Kevin Grey, on your knees now."
Ben!
Grey!
Put your weapon down.
You're surrounded.
They set me up!
Rrar!
Let's go.
"Go, go, go."
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.
Yeah?
Has he ever caught you?
Yeah.
Many times.
"Well, listen."
Since I already lost my deposit and all maybe we should light up.
"No, thanks."
You sure?
"Well, is it cool if I burn one?"
Maybe you'll change your mind.
"Do what you wanna do, I guess."
Hey.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
I just have to go is all.
What's this?
My 18-month chip.
I'm in recovery.
"And, you know, pot is like stepping stones."
Recovery?
That's cool.
Right on.
I respect that.
"You know, I don't really burn much anymore."
It's just a sometime thing.
"But no more, like, in the house."
So you wanna go grab some dinner?
I could really go for some Chinese.
"No, I better hit it."
We...
We cool?
What?
Maybe there.
"Let Ricky talk, and you take a good look."
Yes?
"Excuse me, are you Mr. Maurice Leon?"
Yes.
"Sorry to disturb you, we need your help."
- With what?
- We're looking for...
Give me the photo.
Do you know this woman?
"No, I don't know her."
Sorry.
- Why are you looking for her?
- We aren't looking for her.
She died three weeks ago.
Are you sure you don't recognize her?
"No, I'm sorry."
I can't help you.
You'll excuse me.
I don't think I've ever seen him.
Are you sure?
Did you see how he reacted to the photo?
- How?
- He trembled.
Didn't he tremble?
- What are you doing?
- Knocking.
- What for?
I told you I can't help you.
What do you want now?
"- Sorry, we just wanted to ask..."

"Your Highness, this wine is!"
"Master, it must be an extra old vintage."
Very smart.
Check!
Good move!
This bottle is a gift from the king.
A rare wine!
"Yes, it can stimulate the belly of warriors."
"Master, it's good for your stamina, too."
Check!
You'll lose!
Good move.
Please have a drink!
Master Law!
Thanks!
One more!
"Your Highness, how about you?"
I used to have it every day!
"Try more, this is a good wine."
"Master, you better try one more!"
That's right.
"With good wine and lovely women, everything is changed."
Even a master will ignore his student's presence.
All right.
Go!
Good-dye!

INTERVIEWER:
What's happening here?
We're gonna set a man on fire.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
Because it's cool.
INTERVIEWER:
Why?
Because the school has blown up.
It's nothing serious..
- Hey...
I want the answer.
- Sir...
He had been taking photos of the women coming to the restaurant discreetly...
A customer noticed it.
He was caught.
"When everyone started hitting him, he escaped."
"If we report it to the police, our restaurant will get a bad name..."
So we handled the situation and let it go.
Where is he now?
Is nobody there in the neighbouring house?
"No idea, Sir."
The guy who was working at Beach Walk restaurant.
His name is Dinesh.
It's him.
Yes.
He was working in some hotel.
- Where is he?
"I don't know, Sir."
He should be somewhere around.
Thanks.
(boys chattering)
"Sorry, Sir."
Please throw the ball.
I just said sorry.
"Throw the ball, Sir."
"Oh, here you are!"
Met him?
They came searching for you.
"Hey, stop!"
Hey!
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"You know, something about me being too into myself."
You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
Got a little trick
I've been working on.
Ooh.
"It's up to you now, Jefferson."
"Gray, listen."
"If we're going to do this, we got to do it together."
"It's going to take the two of us, all right?"
- You're right.
- Okay.
"Come on, Gray!"
"Oh, man."
You got my boots wet.
"Jefferson, you did it!"
"We did it, man."
"Gideon, take us back to Rip."
Damn it!
I wanted to be the one to kill him.
"Again, I mean."
Um...
I don't think our problems are over yet.
I'm on it.
On what?
It's not working.
The radiation buildup is too progressive.
I got this.
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Uh...
time will remain intact.
The world?
Not so much.
Stop crying and tell me what you want.
I want to listen to Macarena!
There's going to be music here soon.
Their music?
Yuck!
I want Macarena!
"Sing the song you sang the other day, aunty."
Not today.
I have an irritation in my throat today.
No one sings a song when we assemble for it!
Yes.
Some can't sing and some have a bad throat.
Sharma!
You can't even speak!
How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."
What's a matrimonial necklace with so many others?
Aunty...
Yes?
Yes?
God!
You'll live longer wearing my suit.
Make one for yourself.
24 inches!
Must be a good fighter.
Thank you.
Three foot!
What kind of cuff you like?
Wen's style.
6-inch cuffs.
2-foot splits and 5-foot-long suit.
1.8 foot for shoulders.
30 inches waist.
What are the needles for?
The secure your button.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Let me measure your neck.
Have you finished?
I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"
Master!
- Give him his scissors!
"- Yes, Master!"
It's difficult to clean.
How the hell is this a surprise?
This is the most cliche thing in the world.
Je.
We've been together for many years.
"If you're so happy, you cry."
Tomorrow I'll kick you in the head.
Will you marry me?
Alright.
"I'm sorry, I didn't cry."
It's okay.
Hold on.
I'm crying.
Shit!
What the hell!
February.
"How could you make the wrong diagnosis, doctor!"
?
"This is a person's life, not some pig, dog, or chicken!"
You shouldn't be a doctor!
Go do something else!
"Please calm down, sir."
Calm down please.
Doc.
Here a New Year's present for you.
Last time you didn't come.
So I'm giving it to you now.
Thank you.
Let's have a look.
Rash: 24 spots
Better.
See you again next month.
Any medicine left just tell the pharmacist.
Whoo!
I'm right...
First big piece!
First big piece.
It just went up the hose.
After empty searches.
And near-death dives.
And with the weight Of the pomrenke empire.
On his shoulders...
Mr. Gold strikes again.
Shawn Has finally found gold.
Where his dad always Doubted he would.
Whoo!
I've dealt with setbacks My whole life.
"And, you know, You don't give up."
You just keep pushing forward.
"Yeah, buddy!"
"Yeah, buddy!"
Hard work pays off.
Yeah!
"Flip that flap up, and let's See what it looks like."
Look at that!
Yeah!
Look at that nugget!
- Wow!
- -holy.
That's a big Nugget there.
"Now for the pomrenke name, The sky is the limit."
There's a lot of gold Off this ground.
There's gold at the bluff.
So dad can't give Me anymore.
"100 miles west,"
You're too late!
"- So long, lover boy."
- Ariel!
Poor little princess.
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to--
"- Ursula, stop!"
- Hmph!
"Why, King Triton!"
How are you?
- Let her go!
"- Not a chance, Triton!"
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I--
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable... even foryou."
"Ofcourse, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter ofthe great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange... for someone even better.
"- Eric, what are you doing?"
"- Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
"Oh, grow up, Robin."
There's no such thing as ghosts.
"Nate, can you please help me?"
Technically...
He's right.
- What?
- Yes.
I... but you're also right.
It feels...
Very wrong.
- Yeah.
- But that is not for you to judge.
"You know, if... if he wants to do this..."
I do.
"And she, for some reason, wants to do this..."
"- Yes, please."
- Nate:
And she approves...
"- Yes, of course."
- Then...
"Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows."
"Robin, let's make this official."
Somebody please object.
I object!
Because I love her!
- [Speaks Russian]
- I know so much about you!
I know you like snack chips.
I like snack chips!
You're a side sleeper.
"I'm a side sleeper, right?"
You read a magazine on the potty.
"Hey there, scout."
Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.
"Hey, there."
Kent MansIey.
Work for the government.
Your parents home?
We're eating.
"Who's there, honey?"
hello there.
Do you have a telephone I couId use?
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here.
Pretend you're a gangster.
-You call me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?
"No, I didn't actually see it."
It went off into the woods.
So you don 't have any evidence?
But I've got an eyewitness!
An eyewitness with a concussion.
This thing is a menace.
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!
What did?
"tell me again, MansIey, and this time..."
...listen to yourself.
A giant metal monster.
"Please, open the door."
We have a fault.
"Let me out, please, sir."
I'll fix it.
I doubt it.
Fucking idiot.
"You know, Jimmy, there is something about spine snapping"
That never gets old.
- It sounds like...
"- The end, the beginning."
Or all there's same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man cripples, there's always one question in everyone's mind,"
"Especially in his,"
"""Does his dick works?"""
"Mine didn't, so I plotted my escape from this chair."
- Mommy!
CometoMama.
What did Dad?
What were you thinking?
Wait here.
Hannah!
"Hannah,shejust It fell in the mud."
"It'sfullof mud,David."
She'sfine.

Put it down.
-FortheloveofGod.

"It's just dirt, it's fine."
"Give me your palette, treasure."
Alice did not know who was.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
I have to go.
"Yeah, don't worry."
I got it covered.
Save me some food.
Gus Walker?
This is the FBI.
Careful.
Guess his stolen art isn't an issue anymore.
Okay.
"Yes, ma'am."
Why would Walker steal his own work?
And who killed him?
Someone who knew what they were doing.
No signs of a struggle.
Clean shot.
It's professional.
I've got another question.
Where's the tenth piece?
The tenth piece?
"Yeah, there are nine recovered pieces here."
The surveillance from the gallery shows that Walker had ten photo collages in the show.
So where's the tenth piece?
That was my question.
?
who's here to pay me a visit.
"Special Agent Henson, how are you?"
I'm working.
Jack.
Enough.
Do you want vada?
You mean firebrand?
OK
Hey why is a thread coming out of it?
-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.
- You stitched it?
Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?
- I want to live a little longer.
- He is Das.
- OK thanks.
- Well I have a client approaching in the morning itself.
Yes I am Das.
Haridas.
- The best house broker in South India.
-What can I do for you?
-I am Karthik.
-So what?
- I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent.
A lawyer?
- You look too timid.
Can you raise your voice?
"- Yes, I can."
It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
If he's involved...
I said no.
I'm not going to rest this entire investigation on a glance.
"Maybe he was looking past the photo, through the wall, down the street to a church to ask God what in the hell he did to deserve this torture."
"What then, Dr. Ryan?"
I'm done.
Get Wickes in here.
Now.
(over speaker):
"Agent Gibbs, why am I here?"
(sighing)
(sighing)
(door opens)
Clayton?
My God.
"Bad information, Phil."
They got it wrong.
I'm sorry.
"No, no, I-I'm, I'm just so..."
JARVIS:
"Someone is trying to blackmail me, blackmail the United States Navy."
"Phil, they think it's you."
Are you involved?
No.
He believes him.
You?
Yes.
(door opens)
(sighs)
Wickes say anything else?
He signed a nondisclosure agreement.
"Oh, so he's being cooperative?"
You see what time it is?
What you got that shit on your head for?
Take it off.
Take what off?
"I said, take that shit off!"
"Pa, papi, stop!"
Take it off!
"(Angela) Enrique, no!"
My hair!
No!
What?
Pa...
"Angie, this shit ends now."
Stop it...
"Enrique, no!"
"Leave it alone, he's not hurting anybody!"
"Papi, no, stop, I'm sorry!"
You don't disrespect this house.
"Sit the fuck down, right now."
"Don't do this, he's not hurting anybody."
Put your fucking hands down.
"You're a fucking man, Michael, You're not a woman!"
"No, no!"
Get your fucking hands...
Why you doing this?
"Why are you defending this shit, huh?"
Don't you understand...
this can't happen.
"You're supposed to have my back, Angie."
Kike...
Kike!
Stop it...
"Now, let's go!"
- Good!
"- Luth, let's go home early!"
- Why not?
It only takes one!
"I tell you, Tiny, you got to let him in on it!"
There's no percentage in smartening up a chump!
- But what if he gets in a lucky punch?
- Stick to your buckets!
I'll do the thinking!
"- You ready, Stoker?"
- Never felt better!
Good!
Let's go!
"Looks like we get home early, all right!"
"Hey, why don't you stop that?"
Cheating on yourself!
Good crowd!
Make a showing and you're in!
- Watch out!
- What did I tell you?
- I knew I could take him!
"- Nice going, Luth!"
- Thanks!
- Swell fight!
"Hey, Stoker!"
!
good luck!
"Don't go home yet, folks!"
There's another bout coming!
"And don't forget, Friday night is wrestling night!"
The Lithuanian Angel against the Masked Mastodon!
I got you a key chain.
(SIGHS)
You like it?
Yeah!
"Okay, we gotta go."
(EXHALES)
(ENGINE REVVING)
WOMAN:
"All right, come on, kids."
Twenty minutes till housekeeping.
- Here it is.
- (EMMA SQUEALS)
You wanna shower first?
"Oh, look, the granola family left this."
What is that?
It's a Native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
- It's flypaper for nightmares?
- Mm-hmm.
Let's keep it.
Yeah.
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
NEAL:
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time to retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
"Settle down, I think it's time."
Together?
Don't you wanna?
He was a foreigner too... a Frenchman.
She welcomed the kindness he showed her.
"But later, she was fired."
He lost touch with her.
End of story.
"Anna Rachevsky, right."
- Coming back?
- Yes.
Thou hast sent him gifts?
No.
You have offered him flowers?
You've written him a poem?
I ...
"Even zero, it remains a proof of love."
"If you had him said""I love you"", maybe you would go to the church instead of Aymeric."
You think?
Yes!
Move over.
How it happens in all the stories?
The girl will marry the wrong person.
Here arises the true love and expresses.
"Damn, you're right."

Titanic.
Yes.
But  Titanic  He died at the end.
Exactly.
That's a great proof of love.
"And you, champ?"
What is proof of your great love?
"It is you, florist Melanie."
Jessica is there?
Always has been.
Good night.
What about the mouth thing we'd talked about?
- Mouth thing?
- I want to show off my new skills.
- Not right now.
- Go to sleep and I'll go to work.
- Can't we just...
"- Okay, I'll back off."
Sleep tight.
- I'm not ready for the tournament.
- You sure aren't.
- Did you give Mia head then?
- You're disrupting my swing!
It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
- I feel weird.
- I can't breathe.
- Did you take something?
- Franz gave me a pill.
- Simon's with your sister.
In the VIP Lounge.
You can't allow that.
"- Go home, Luise."
- You can't make me.
Mum will freak if she hears you came here on a school night.
Go home.
- I hate you.
- Go home.
And you come with me.
Move over.
- Where are you going?
- For a wash.
- Will you be back?
- Maybe.
You bastard!
She's my little sister!
Why did you do that magazine?
- Can't you just forget it?
- It was so way out of line.
- I don't regret it.
- So you'd do it again?
- If I have to.
- I don't need shit like this.
Keep your hands off Luise.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
- Please don't be too rough.
- Haven't you done it before?
- Oh baby.
- I missed you so much.
"I missed you too, my darling."
I've missed you too.
We're gonna do that.
We're gonna swing.
We're going to be a family again.
Always.
"Marcus,"
Will you take me back?
"well, i don't know."
- That's all right.
- I need to think about it a little bit.
- Oh.
Oh.
"- Regina: see, i told you."
I thought about it.
Yes.
Oh marcus.
Oh!
Oh.
Mom.
"Oh, y'all go on."
I got this.
This house is busier than grand central station.
- Who is it now?
- Man: papa joe's furniture emporium.
"Well, what you want?"
We don't have anything else for you to take.
"Mama, you let them come in here and take whatever they want,"
Because everything i need i already have right here.
- Come and take it all.
"Ifwe're not there by midnight, someone else gets them."
"All right, I'll take you."
Meet me at the airport at 7.30 tonight.
"I'll wait at the information desk, okay?"
Ofcourse.
Will he come?
Will you go?
I trust her.
Everybody's here.
Let's go.
How's it going?
Right.
Full alert now.

"Jeffrey, the cops are everywhere!"
Run away!
"Jeffrey, the cops want you!"
Don't come near me!
"Jeffrey, are you there?"
"I better try it, shouldn't I?"
"Oh, yeah!"
This is a bed.
This is a real bed.
What's that up there?
- Is there a picture of Uncle?
"- Yeah, here."
And here.
This is Grandpa.
Very young.
Forty-five years ago.
This picture was taken the same year... he died.
Those large letters...
What do they mean?
"""Let us all meet again to join in the beyond. """

That's not right.

What's this?

Clark sincerely regretted it.
Saying that it's almost unbearable having to leave like that.
Big Brother...
It's ridiculous!
- I'll never take it!
- What's so bad about it?
I won't even hear about it!
"It's embarrassing, don't you understand?"
- Why embarrassing?
- There're people looking...
- Is this hat for me?
"- Yes, for you."
What a mess I've got in!

Can you do it for me?
I did it for you last time.
Thanks for nothing.
Bye.
Some friend...
Damn hypocrite.
"When she needs anything, you must do it even if it's nighttime."
Hello?
May I speak to Gennady Borisovich?
"Ghena, are you playing games with me?"
It's almost 7.
You said so.
"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.
We need him.
The business.
I must take him home.
You'd only be taking home his body.
His mind is...
Look for yourself.
I hope that ending was properly terrifying.
What's this?
Nothing but sawdust.
"Oh, well, two can play at that game."
That's all I have here.
This concludes our program for tonight.
"On our next program, we shall both be back."
Me and my shadow.
Good night.

How dare you cheat my money?
"Brother Foon, hide up first."
Hide up?
"Yan, take care."
I am not impotent...
I am not!
"Hubby, what's wrong with you?"
It's only a dream.
Foon said that I am merciless and selfish.
Is that true?

Do you ever wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes?
No one's been in here for months.
I'll use my imagination.
Annabelle.
"Coming, Mother."
- What's with the glasses inside?
"- My, um..."
Ahem.
My eyes are a little sensitive today.
- You're new around here.
"- Oh, on the contrary, I'm very old."
Bourbon.
Neat.
I haven't been gone that long.
I would remember someone who looked like you.
Yeah?
Where did you go?
- Around.
About.
- Heh.
Been there.
"Ha, ha."
I love to see a man drown his sorrows.
It's so sexy.
It's more like nursing my wounds.
And you?
I was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off.
That's not very nice.
Yeah.
"Last time I was in town, I slept with her boyfriend."
- That's not very nice either.
- It happens.
"Yes, it does."
I shouldn't know about this?
A mother can't know about this?
"- No, I just mean..."
- You're graduating.
- I know.
- So we're here to see you graduate.
This is Raul.
So you and Raul are just here to see me graduate.
Don't be silly.
Your father will be joining me later.
- My father?
- Yes.
Remember him?
"Tall, bow tie."
"I remember Dad, Mom."
I just...
Rory told you.
Yes.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
It's a little late if it's not.
"No, it's perfectly fine that you're here."
Absolutely.
I'm just surprised.
- Who are you?
- I'm Raul.
- I just told you that.
"- Did Rory invite Raul, too?"
Raul is my cameraman.
Cameraman?
He'll be filming the ceremony for us.
He's very talented.
He screened an independent film of his as an audition.

That we should get a mattress for that closet.

"Dumbarton, is Dumbarton in there?"
No.

I knew it.
You'll tell me everything now!
You'll sign everything off to me!
How much did you get for it?
How much was your price?
You're the one who sold your soul.
You!
You didn't rape me.
You stole my life away.
You killed my son.
He could have lived.
He could have been saved.
But you demolished the hospital.

You did it for the sake of your damned mega-center.
Save our children!

I think she just needs some guidance.
And I've already had some sponsors asking about her.
- Who?
- Slaughter Water.

"- Yeah, they don't want him."
He has an image problem I have to figure out.
Fuck.
Too fucked up for Slaughter Water.
How'd that happen?
Yeah?

I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."

"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.

You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"

Doctors are always like that.

Pordenone.
"There's no sun, there's no sea."
There's no me.
"If you have something to say, okay, if not, I'II go back to the festival."
"Every time I have something to tell you, you gotta leave."
- What transfer?
.
- You're staying here?
Fire calling fuse.

"The music's done, they're wantin' the 'works."
"I don't understand a word, could you repeat clearly?"
I can neverunderstand a word when you talk!
"Mattia, hearme?"
Shoot!
"- hello, Mattia?"
Down...
Down..
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, Rene?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, Rene."
"I like you, Rene, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fraulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.
- The driver probably ran out of coal.
- Probably forgot his ration book.
"Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me."
"Don't you worry, sir."
I could recognise Faber in a stocking mask.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Thank you.
Blackout.
Pull your blinds down.
Blackout.
"Come on, give us a bit of room, pal."
Someone take him away.
Come on.
Blimey.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Be still or I'll kill you.
Why are you looking for me?
- I'm not.
- Don't lie.
"Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy?"
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow.
They're waiting for you at Glasgow.
"So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy?"
Congratulations.
"Oh, my God!"
Thank you.
You've been terribly kind.
You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch?
"Well, gentlemen, I promised mywife I, uh..."
I'm outof politics.
You justcame down here forthe weather.
"Is that right, Mr. Nixon?"
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
"Whatabout'68, Dick?"
"Five years, Trini."
"In politics, that's an eternity."
Dick.
Your country needs you.
Unfortunately the country's notavailable right now.

"- Just pour it, Tony."
"- Come on, Tony."
Come on.
"- Okay, okay."
I thought you were turning over a new leaf.
"Yeah, I nearly died today, Rabbit."
And you saved my life.
"I guess, um... we're even."
Is that you want to be?
Even?
All accounts closed.
Everything tied up.
Nothing complicated.
I...
I... don't know.
"Yeah, neither do I."
Thank you.
Tony.
Previously on rescue me...
What if you never see him again?
And I also started drinking again.
But let me explain.
- And that is so stupid.
- It's--it's not stupid.
I got--I figured it out.
I have a system.I can control it.
Hook a brother up with a long island iced tea.
- Who's gonna know?
- I will.
"Besides, I told your mom I'm watching out for you."
- Life changed.
It got...
- Boring?
It doesn't need to be.
Come on.
"Oh, my God..."
"You know Candace, in catering?"
- My first wife.
- I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Candy Kanaskie.
No wonder she left me.
Omelettes.
"Sure, a bachelor's standby."
"Oh, I'm married."
"Oh yeah, you said first wife."
I assumed that meant there was a second.
And third.
I was talking about me.
Omelettes are my standby.
Sausage?
Kielbasa!
"So what, after the lawyer who went gay, you figure, what, one then done?"
"Well, the job, the kids, it got hard to find a serious..."
- No cheese?
- No.
"No, no, no."
"So it's not a classic, then."
Kanaskie classic.
"Yeah, my exes, they blamed the job too."
"No kids, though, unless you count the ones I supervise here."
"It's a lot, but they just didn't understand what it takes."
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.

DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
"I feel your anger, yes!"
"Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes?"
No?
Now use it!
Harness it!
Hmm.
Boom!
Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.
"Excuse me, Salvadore?"
I feel like my sacrum is really tight.
Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."
-.
Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
(lock rattles)
George?
"George, please let me in."
Are you from the printers?
We've been waiting...
Madame Sand.
Pardon.
please excuse... (murmuring)
Madame Sand is on her way up.
Don't do that!
(whistles) It is rather far.
"- I'II have to face her, that's all."
- alfred!
I'II be perfectly behaved.
Even a little scornful.
"No, you won't."
You'II be impossible.
I don't want a scene.
Now get in there.
And hurry up!
"hello, George!"
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
"- How are the children, the country?"
- Fine.
Listen.
"I need another 3,000 francs."
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses.
"The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home..."
The divorce took half of everything.
AII right.
But let me have one more instalment first.
(LAUGHING)
"Never mind him, he's mad."
Come along.
(WHISPERING)
Stayne!
(BANDERSNATCH BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GROWLING)
I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
"I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me."
Off with her head!
"Stand back, Mallymkun."
How's this for muchness?
"No, no!"
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
-Take it to the White Queen.
-I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
"Run, Alice!"
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then."
-Give me the sword.
-Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.
You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
"I will see, madame."
Is that the new baby?
She's adorable.
Can I hold her?
Darling.
- Countess!
"- Hello, George."
I just saw the new baby.
She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour?
Very.
What brings you to Paris?
- My mother's ill.
- Oh.
I've been so depressed.
Seeing friends again will do me good.
How's Franz?
He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.
- Why do you ask?
- Marie...
I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
"For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too."
"In Angers, remember, I wore that dress."
Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress.
"On the contrary, my dear."
I know the man.
I want revenge!
He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
"It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back!
"Although the charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I...
I woke up.
Yeah.
That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy?
Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.

"I've wanted to tell you for a long time... your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the formula.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just... got worse.
What did you do?
"I'm sorry, father."
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
"I knew when he was feeding, and I would go out at the same time."
No.
"No, it can't be."

He was here less than hour ago.
Did you hear anything?
no.
Huh.
"- Ricky, my husband."
Ricky.
- Is he Italian?
"- No, it's just a nickname."
I gave it to him a longtime ago.
Any kids?
You're still young.
What are you looking for?
Our father.
And who is that?
What did you want from me?
Are you Algerian?
- Not any more.
- Jewish?
No.
Muslim?
Christian?
Why is it so important?
Because we need to know why they separated you from our mother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Dorona, what do you want from me?"
This is your mother and this is you.
"Very beautiful woman, your mother."
She's obviously very brave.
How did she die?

"Are you angry with her, Dorona?"
Don't be angry with her.

The Boss has taken up anew contract.
The rules say... you may sacrifice akin.
But never miss a contract.
And anyway this is about blood-ties and not contract.
Because Shiv is my brother.
I'll say it three times.
He's my brother...
my brother... my brother.

The Boss' blood boils.
And when it does he spares no one.
You were right Ayushman.

I tested steering wheels and pens.
How was it?
Okay.
Steering wheels?
How was your day?
I made -
I was in the kitchen.
Did you see the results?
"There weren,t any."
It was just these guys who were there with different stuff.

Why?
I'm at the local police Station.
You were mugged?
"No, I went into a bar and they arrested me."
- Why?
- I went in on a motorbike!
Are you alright?
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- You're drunk!
- A local fruitjuice.
"I've been thinking about this, I'm coming down tomorrow."
No!
"You can't, it's dangerous."
I'II show you dangerous!
"My friends,"
Hallelujah.
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.
- You okay?
- Sure.
Is this what you really want?
Do I have a choice?
Molly?
"Molly, do you know where you are?"
You're in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.
We're taking very good care of you.
You like my ring?
"I know you're scared, but I'll stay with you."
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.
"Okay, let's extubate her."
Carter....
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs.
Gases are good.
All right.
Excellent.
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.
Make sure the cuff is down before you extubate her.
Good.
"Now, what I want you to do is pretend you're blowing out your birthday candles."
Take another big breath.
"When I say go, blow out real hard, okay?"
Go.
- Nice.
I'm inside.
Be careful.
Marilyn could come home at any minute.
"Okay, Ricky."
Oh my.
"Marnie, what are you doing?"
I'm dusting for fingerprints.
And a little dirt.
"Come on, Marnie."
Looks for something that looks like a clue.
"Sorry, Ricky."
Let's start looking right now.
It's a very scary foyer.
I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
"Oh, yes..."
I am.
"- Hey, douche bag, get out of there!"
- What does this mean?
"- Come on, fuckface!"
"- Alright, pig... get out here!"
Come on!
"- Come on, come on!"
- Get out here.
"Don't hurt me, I'm just a poor college student!"
"Poor, poor?"
Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
"With you in a minute, Granville."
What is it?
Is me slip showing?
I bet there's a hole in me tights!
"No, no."
"Calm down, Julie."
Everything's fine.
"Well, almost f--f--fine."
Have you ever thought about m--modelling?
Have you ever thought of g--getting me out?
-
"- Modelling, Mr Arkwright?"
-
- Yes.
-
- I don't think I'd be any good.
-
- Under my supervision and guidance.
-
- I were never any good before.
-
- You've done it before?
Oh.
L--l--I think I should s--say s--straightaway that I could only offer you a f--fraction of the g--going rate.
I didn't realise you had m--m--m--modelled before.
I'm still here!
-
- It's been quite a while.
-
- My feelings exactly!
I think it were in Standard Four.
I made a gnome out of Plasticine.
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive, you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
All right.
So... what do you think?
Did they see us?
"No, man."
I think we're good.
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!
No.
Where the hell is Jimmy?
He should have been here ten minutes ago.
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is.
Wait a minute.
"No, no."
What?
What?
Let me see.
- Who the hell is that?
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
(swallowing )
(whispering ) Did you steal my tarts?
Your Majesty.
(whispering ) Squimberry juice.
-l was so hungry!
I didn't mean to!
N-Off with his head!
please don't!
No!
I have little ones to look after!
Go to his houseNand collect the little ones.
I love tadpoles on toastNalmost as much as I love caviar.
Your Majesty.
Drink!
Majesty?
Nwhere have you been lurking?
I have found the Oraculum.
That?
Looks so ordinary for an oracle.
on the Frabjous Day.
I'd know that tangled messNof hair anywhere.
is it Alice?
I believe it is.
What's she doingNwith my darling Jabberwocky?
She appears to be slaying it.
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?
but it will happenNif we don't stop her.
Stayne.
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
"I don't know, professor."
This scratch looks pretty old.
The Ark's magnetic.
"Yeah, let's check it out later, come on."
There's no engine!
That'll keep 'em out for a while.
And us in.
"Shh, quiet!"
Sound the alarm.
"Come on, MacGyver, they know we've escaped."
We haven't yet.
Give me a hand here.
No one left through the gate.
Search every inch of this place.
Find them and kill them.
"Load it up, professor."
What?
You sure this will work?
Nope.
Good.
That's the MacGyver I know.
Open this up.
Looks like they're gonna open the door for us.
Get some men over here!
"Yes, sir."
Now what are you doing?
Trying to stop some ethnic cleansing.
Buckle up.
It worked!
It worked!
Ha-ha-ha!
I knew it would.
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
Let's see what's down there.
(FOOTSTEPS CLANGlNG)
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"(MUTTERS) Oh, my God!"
EMERSON:
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
-Brown.
"-Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
"Before you dropped out, huh?"
MAN:
There you are.
(david YELLS)
EMERSON:
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."
I won't either.
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.
What brings you home?
Vacation?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
I can't control it.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
I don't know when I've had such good sport.
"Thank you, fair lady."
You must feel honored to be chosen by a baron.
Bring her to me!
(ALL SNARLING)
(SCREAMS)
(WHINNIES)
(GROWLING)
What's this?
You're one of our kind.
You're wrong!
I'm nothing like you!
I'm a human being!
Unbelievable.
How interesting.
You're a seriously confused fellow.
One only has to look at your eyes to know what you are.
Unless you're...
Can it be?
A hybrid?
Is that it?
Hello!
"Sorry to interrupt the hunt, Baron Howard!"
And who are you?
A hunter as well.
Only my quarries happen to be vampires.
What?
I wanted your last meal to be special.
"So tonight, you dine on the finest silver."
A convention of predators?
"-There, there!"
-Why was not I invited?
-Will.
"-Guys, guys?"
-Will not go ...
-Get out.
-You will not survive.
Me misses.
Will stop.
I think the best part.
"If I'm invading your space, How about this?"
"No, no, I'm talking about, separated from truth."
More ...
Why?
My life is like now.
"I can change, be less invisible."
"See, you'll be great."
"See you, kid."
"Will, please do not let me."
"I'll take you, you, you, and you."
"Please, someone, anyone, I lost my Will."
"I beg you, please Will my return."
-Mano.
-Sven.
"-I will give to his wife, okay."
"-Okay, thank you."
"Right Sven, here I come."
Form a single queue and smiled.
You must be glorious.
And you must be Sven.
"It is a pleasure for me to know, seriously because I'm thrilled."
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
It's too hard on my ego.
"Either way, it felt to get out and get some exercise."
"While you're in the shower, I'll scramble some eggs"
And make some of my special pancakes.
Pancakes for me?
And for me.
Something to restore that energy we've burned out.
JEFF:
Only if you got lots of honey.
My wallet.
I left it at the court.
I hooked it on the chain-link fence.
I'm so stupid.
No problem.
We'll just walk back.
"No, I'll go back."
You stay here with Greta.
It'll be faster.
JEFF:
"OK, Greta."
That's try to stay awake while she's gone.
[Greta whimpers]
"Yes, you're a good dog, Greta."
[Ambient growling]
[Choking]
Jeff!
No!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Jeff!
[Sobbing]
[Wailing]
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
You understand me?
You hear me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it.
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
Why are you bugging me?
I know what to do.
"You little hick, just make sure you do it."
You can be such a pain.
- Hey!
Just do it!
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
- No.
- Aww.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."
- I'm keeping score in my head.
"You said you were open to loving some games, right?"
- Come on.
"- Play the game, Mags."
"Get up there, let's game it up."
- [overlapping chatter]
"- All right, games."
- Yay.
- There she is.
Team of one.
Team of one.
Let's do it.
- All right.
- Here we go.
"You're gonna crush it, Mags."
"Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh."
"Okay, everybody's forgotten about you!"
"You're all alone, you're all alone!"
Your only friend's an old man!
Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.
- Not tonight.
Nobody's beating me.
You get out of here.
I don't want you mixed up in this.
"- If i go to jail, I'm goin' alone."
- Wait!
Your money's in your briefcase!
Don't do it!
Don't take that sled.
It's a piece of shit.
Take the 4-40!
Excellent power-to-weight ratio.
- What?
- Two-year unlimited warranty!
- An on board toolkit!
- Okay!
Fine!
This beauty is built for you!
"- Hand warmers, halogen lights!"
- Shut your trap.
I got it!
No!
Pull the choke.
The lines are dry.
"- No, don't flood it."
- You said pull the choke.
Finesse.
Like getting a chick off.
We went over this!
- [ Engine Rewing ]
It's the weed capital of the world!
- No.
- Put the bong away!
"- Take the inaugural hit, dude."
- No!
"Come on, man."
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away.
Put the frickin' bong away.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turb--
Terrorist!
Roldy?
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
"- No, ma'am, not a terrorist."
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.
He said he got a bomb!
"No, people, it's a water pipe for tobacco."
"No, no, no, it's not a bomb."
It's just a bong.
Poison gas!
It's marijuana!
Marijuana!
"You picked the wrong plane, you terrorist fuck!"
Hey!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
There are three air marshals on board.
Three!
We are not terrorists!
"Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb."
It is.
Mainly it is heartaches.
You mean real heartaches?
"Deep down, world looking empty?"
"-- ""Need a shoulder to lean on"" heartaches?"
-
"- Yes, they're the ones."
"Yes, that's them."
I get 'em sometimes.
I know what they're like.
-
- They're terrible.
-
- Terrible!
I used to get 'em a lot.
Used to think life was really bad.
Then me husband left me.
I've felt heaps better since!
"You see, when you least expect it, something turns up."
What's wrong with Granville?
"Oh, you poor love!"
"There, Mrs Featherstone, your change."
F--f--f--f--four...
F--f--f--four...
That's just right.
"It's a very funny sensation, getting entangled at my age with an errand boy."
(COMMOTION OUTSIDE)
Wh--What's all that going on out there?

That's him!

Oh brother!

Huh!

"Chloe, the magical waitress Chloe from Albuquerque, or Donny, the angry busboy who shot Luke ?"
I'll go with Chloe on that one.
Good.

Okay.
Okay.

"Sadie, the tough as nails yet soulful jewelry maker or Lindsay, my grandfather's illegitimate, bookish love child ?"
"I can't, Seth."
Sure... sure you can.
It's very easy.
Go on.
Just go.
I'm not going to go alone.
"We need help, man."
I need help.
"Just sit me down, okay ?"
All right.
"Okay, but I'm going to come right back."
I know.
Do you hear that ?
No.
Exactly.
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.
Or... maybe they're just faking us out.
There we go.
Locked and loaded.
Just how mama likes it.
"Taylor, a gun ?"
Where did you get that ?
"No, this was never closed like this."
"Oh, there's a lock here."
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
"Oh, hooray."
Thank you.
"- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup."
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No.
"Hi, Rob Frey."
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
"Oh, absolutely."
Gosh.
"- It's painted now, huh?"
- Terrible.
"I mean, it's just such a shame."
"""Dearest Annie,"
"""I must build one of the great buildings of the time."
"""You must help me build this particular building."
"""I doubt if I can do it without you."
"""Just think how low architecture has gotten down."
"Just go to the bathroom, get the scissors and cut me loose."
Nothing bad has happened.
Cut me loose.
"I want you to say 10 times, ""I won't listen to my brother."""
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't...
"Louder, please."
I won't listen to my brother.
I won't listen...
I said louder.
Our mom wouldn't do that.
More clearly.
Elias...
I'm sorry.
Again.
"I'm sorry, Elias."
( turns off video )
Come now.
Please.
Cut me loose.
What happened to your nose?
Nothing.
Nothing serious.
"There, you see?"
You'll cut me loose and I'll make you breakfast.
"Cut my feet loose, they hurt."
Lukas?
"I know it's hard, but we'll make it."
"Come, just cut my feet loose."
"Come on, it'll take a sec."
I'll make breakfast.
Just cut it.
It's the bloody guerrilleros.
We can't hit them from here.
Call the helicopter.
Unit 47 to helicopter.
Please respond.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
- Those bastards are in control of the dam.
"Yes, we know."
They've taken out the guards.
We'll try to attack them from here.
Please support us.
We've got no heavy weapons.
We must try to get closer first.
Over.
- What are you waiting for?
Attack!
- Hurry up!
"- Hurry up, Jaime."
They're coming back.
- All right.
Why can't you throw hand grenades at them?
We'll be above them soon.
They're not going to enjoy this.
They'll be here in a minute.
"Hurry up, damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
They've hit the helicopter!
Is it bad?
Can you get up?
I need help!
José is injured!
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

Do you know your name?
I think.
So?

"If they offer coffee, we'II give a MiIanese no: categorical."
- How much sugar?
.
"- Two, please."
"You say ""no, thank you."""
Got any fruitjuice?
It's lemon juice he made himself.
"Here's yourregistered letter, yourreceipt, the juice was very good, maybe a bit strong."
It's his Postamat.
"That's wonderful, but we have to run."
Even I didn't understand that.
Goodbye.
Good thing it was a MiIanese no!
"If it was NeapoIitan, we'd have stayed for dinner?"
.
SorrowfuI Mother...
immaculate Virgin...
DeIiverus from evil...
Where are you goin'?
Where are we goin'?
"Cyprus, a Ietterfrom Ciro."

"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.
"Oh, thanks, Ethan."
"Thanks so much, buddy."
We can always count on you for juice and juice-related things and... really just juice.
But we love juice.
Are you kids okay?
"Oh, we're just great, thanks."
Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Why are you out of breath?
"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.
"Oh, I'm so poor."
And why are you in your underwear?
Because I am rich.
There's been a burglary.
Somebody stole my chocolate!
I am very shocked by that.
"Okay, what was rule number two?"
Always believe in yourself?
No!
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.
"I seek your blessings, mom."
She also pays respect!
"That's enough, drama queen."
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..
you go to the end of the West Colonnade.
There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
You think I put my country through this for money?
I hate mercenaries.
It's about time.
I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..
Weapon system unlocked.
Enter presidential launch code.
"Mr. President, please wake up, wake up."
Please!
"Sir, we're at DEFCON 1."
The nuclear football in the White House went live.
That's impossible.
It's happening.
I can not hear you!
Does your heart hurt?
Let me have a look.
"The old warriors believed, that the heart was sacred."
"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.
"You disappoint me, Bishop."
I expected much more from Mara's husband.
You are more trash than the man.
Barbarous and cruel.
A daughter.
"Our daughter, Mara."
"Come on, Bishop."
Follow me.
How can you leave us alone ?
!
Are you my daughter?
My name is Aluxia.
I have been waiting for you.
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?
Not quite.
Just tired.
You've been dreaming.
Yes.
And you were there.
I do not want to get lost.
"- Leave it alone, Aluxia."
- Ok dad.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."
[Tunes radio to Greek music]
Here it comes.
There.
Look at that.
You like it?
In Albany.
We are in Albania.
"Yes, like Mother Teresa."
"In prison, His Majesty."
Yes...
Okay.
Yes.
"Seeing Him, His Majesty..."
Why did you tell her about the prison?
- I did not want to invent a story.
The Chief of Cabinet will call you to this number.
And then we'll call the guards.
"Now I'm off, if you do not mind her."
"Thank you, sorry."
She does not answer.
- Wait.
I do not mean to wait.
"First, you must contact..."
It's ringing.
"Yes, we are healthy and safe..."
Did anyone explain it to you?
Can you contact the embassy in Albania?
Go call the guards.
Lord?
Lord?
Ludovic and Louise were immersed in the protocol.
"Meanwhile, that little brother had returned to being a puppet."
"Sire, here's a clean shirt."
I see.
Agree.
Goodbye.
"Mr. Lloyd, the palace has canceled Our King."
-Otherwise you are very nice.
-To your health.
"When our official delegation comes here, we will bring you a decoration."
You golden boy!
I will mount the little horse...
Sing with me.
When I join the army
Everyone!
"And you, my dear"
-Call me Pepa.
"-Hi, Pepa."
-What should I call you?
"-Whatever you like, Pepa."
"-For example, can I call you monster?"
"-You can, Pepa."
-And I will also call you monster.
"-Call me monster 2,"
-so there's order in it.
"-Bye, monsters."
"Bye, Pepa."
"Boys, I like you."
Yirinka!
These are my friends from space.
"Nice to meet you, I'm the princess of Monaco."
They are just flying back.
Cheers.
"-Cheers, Pepa."
"-Cheers, monsters."
Well?
Do they congratulate us?
I'm looking forward to going home.
"We'll get bonuses, I'll buy new aquarium, feed the fish, and have peace and quiet."
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
- OK.
"- Just go, Paul."
Well.
I'd better get off.
You'll call and let us know how he is?
You'll see that he's all right?
Look out for him?
"- I hardly know him, really."
- Promise me.
So say it.
All right.
I promise.
Where the hell have you been?
- How's it going?
- Great.
You brought me gear.
You have to stay in overnight for observation.
I'm not staying here all night.
"No, I've things to do."
You just had a suspected heart attack.
Lie down.
"Heart attack, me arse."
Just a touch of angina.
More lively than usual.
You're staying here.
What's it to you?
"Please don't leave me here, Paul."
Please.
You stay here.
OK.
That everything you wanted to say to her?
Let's go.
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
Hold on.
Hold on.
"Sam, hang it up."
Hang it up.
[Typing]
[Beeping]
Why don't I just run a search on his credit card?
Mmm.
Smart.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- James W. Harpel?
- Mm-hmm.
Looks like he opened up a tab at Pure about an hour ago.
Thank you.
That reverse psychology stuff?
"That's cheating, Sam."
Uh-huh.
"If you ain't cheating', you ain't tryin', Mike."
Damn.
Hey.
You guys see this?
"""Mancuso menaces Montecito."
"Ghost of former owner haunts hotel."" What the hell is this?"
I don't know.
Maybe that guy Taylor went to the press.
"What, because we made him pay what he owed?"
"Well, if he thought the story was gonna hurt us, he was wrong."
Bookings are way up.
Haunted hotels...
quite popular apparently.
Quite popular apparently?
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?
!
That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.
Nor I.
Billie!
Billie!
Zack!
Did I miss anything?
I love you.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
"–Hey, where is he?"
Where is he?
"–What are you gonna do, hit me?"
–I don't see any witnesses here.
–Yeah?
Let my bruises do the talking.
Don't make me do something that we both don't want me to do.
–Yeah?
Go ahead.
–Just tell me where he is!
Please.
Just tell me where he is.
"Go ahead and whack me, you cracker prick."
I'll make my own million.
–Is that what you want?
–Mm-hmm.
–Is that what you really want?
–Mmm.
"–All right, let's go."
Let's go.
–What?
What are you... –Come here!
–No!
Let go of me!
–Leave me alone!
–Open up!
"You and me, we're about to get real acquainted if you don't start remembering."
–Don't touch me!
–Where is he?
–Open up!
–Let go of me!
You don't wanna tell me?
Brilliant.
"Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic..."
"Well, whatever it was you just did,"
It was absolutely heroic.
"It was nothing, I just..."
Get off the street!
- Run!
- Hide!
Here come the goon goons!
Let's get 'em!
They run like chickens.
More goons!
We're trapped!
Hide or they'll get ya.
Over here.
It ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans.
The earthquakes' got girls in their gang.
Let's finish 'em.
"Now, where in the world did that come from?"
It was a set up.
- Let's give it to 'em.
- Yeah.
That was an ambush!
Stop banging into me.
I can't see.
I can't get out.
Get me out.
Get it off me.
Yeah!
All right!
"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Yeah, thanks a lot."
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
Cash.
Who is this?
No I.D.
Caught her sneaking outside with this.
"Well, you're not a reporter."
Who sent you?
I don't like uninvited guests.
And I don't like waiting.
"If your security isn't airtight, we can't do business."
None of us will.
Put her in the cell.
Hook her up.
Let's go.
Move it.
"Oh, my God."
"Amanda, what have they done to you?"
You're about to find out.
Get in there.
M-more.
I want more.
- This is private property.
- Call a cop.
Think you can school me?
Watch me.
"If I shoot you now,"
I can't have any fun with you later.
You won't have any fun with me now.
I might have a little.
- Yes?
- It's Stone.
- This better be important.
"- Trust me, you're gonna want to hear this."
"Oh, it's Wayne."
How are you now?
"Oh, not so bad."
"Yeah, this one's too hard."
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)
We don't have time to discuss that business.
Devon.
Stewart.
I come in peace.
How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock?
You don't.
Speak.
Do not approach.
- Seen Katy around?
- No.
- That is all.
- (GROWLING) Stewart!
Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
Slug.
Suppose Thompson walks in.
"If he walks in his sleep, he'll walk in."
He's upstairs snoring his head off.
What did you turn that light on for?
"Listen, are you on the level with me?"
"Oh, that's okay."
What's the matter?
Are you getting yellow?
No.
"Just careful, see?"
"Hello, kids."
Don't you think you need some dough?
It's pretty late to get a hitch around here.
I think you better take some.
Here you are.
"Go on, take it."
"No, we don't need your dough."
We'll get along okay.
"Yeah, sure you will."
"Well, so long, kids."
Good luck.
"There, see?"
He don't care.
Come on.
"Gee, he's nuts, ain't he?"
Come on.
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- Yeah.
Everything's all right.
"What's the matter, Patsy?"
Just playing a long shot.
"- Mitchell, you understand this."
- You know what I'm going through.
- I do.
"So, why won't you help me?"
!
"OK, you know what?"
There... there is another option.
It just might be the answer.
We recarpet?
What?
!
"No, no, no, no."
"This guy, he's one of us."
A vampire?
- How did you get his number?
- He found me.
He says that he has systems in place.
No killing.
But he'll make sure the kid's fed.
We have to do something.
"- You'll take Adam to him, then?"
"- Oh, no."
"Me and him, we do not get on."
"I'll call him and make the introduction, but after that I don't want any part of it."
"Oh, just take me to them."
Wow.
"Oh, wow."
This...
"Oh, this is really nice."
"All right, George!"
"Little bit of help here, please?"
Mm.

You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.
Shoes!
"naples: gunfire downtown,"
MinisterMaroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the yearbegan, 1,300 in the Iast ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transferto milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't yourfriend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Where'd you spend it?
"Look, man, I just wanted to start over."
Quit the Agency.
Have your drink.
It could have been anybody walk through your door.
Yeah.
But it was you.
Go clean up your mess.
Three minutes.
Start the count.
"No, please, God."
Why did you do that?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
What a shame.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"- The fuck, Emerson?"
No loose ends.
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
"Okay, I'll meet you over there."
You got it.
Come on!
Didn't tell me it was this heavy.
Hey!
"Hey, what the fuck are you guys doin' in here, huh?"
"You got a problem, buddy?"
"Uh, no-no problem."
"No, you ain't got no problem, right?"
That's right.
"Just be cool, motherfucker."
"Yo, Bobby..."
"Yo, yo, come here, man."
Hold this one.
Come on.
"Now, I advise you two to take that beer out the trunk of your car."
"And I advise you, smiley, to put that knife away."
You advise?
That's a pretty big word for a nigger.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, fuck!"
[Grunting]
[Box cracking]
"You okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Well, let's get rid of these turkeys and clean up this mess, huh?"
- Hey.

Thanks.
You okay?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, how do you feel about goin' to shoot some pool?"
[Screams]
[Audience booing]
"[Normal voice] No, no, no, no, he's okay!"
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"[Scratchy voice] These cats are more than just pets, sir."
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
[Cheers and applause]
[Laughs]
Uh-oh.

Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!

"- For your own good, I hope this is a lie."
- Look at yourself.
Stupid fucking nigger police.

Maybe a robbery.
There's nothing in the room except for a coat...
Got it.
Hanging behind the bathroom door.
[Police radio chatter]
There's a key here.
Looks like a rental.

I hope it's not something too gross.
- What the hell?
- Why's this guy watching us?
I don't know.
Better find out.
"All right, we better tell the captain."
I'll call him.
Might be a good idea to put some uniforms at our houses.
Got it.

Nothing.
The doctor told me to rest.
And I expect support.
There are some new rules.
I want absolute silence in the house.
I need sleep.

He offered to show me a map
To the druid astronomicons.
So I'd like to make the same offer to you.
Don't tell me
You're not interested.
In the keys to stonehenge?
Sure.
I'm sorry to be so last-minute.
My contact just called me himself.
Shall we?
Yeah.
A map to the astronomicons...
They've been lost for 2000 years.

Excuse me.
"Gareth watson is signing books here,"
Today?
You could have got someone to post it for you.
"Oh, Come on."
You could've got your mum to post it.
I don't bloody know.
You wanted an alibi.
- Maybe you sent it.
You're blaming me..
- Bullshit!
"Oh, it's you."
You sent it!
Don't listen to him.
"Chris, just fucking admit it!"

I want a confession.
We'll keep playing until we get one.
"Truth or Dare, Chris?"

There's a lot of time to think.
Strange ideas come to mind.
For example?
Some things.
When you're alone?
-No.
Even though you're with me?
Even more with you.
Then you're afraid of me.
You?
Not a bit.
Maybe indirectly.
"Those ideas may scare me, not you."
I'm glad I don't scare you.
What'ss the impression you get about me?
-Fear is not one.
Will you be upset if I tell you something?
I hope not.
Sometimes you make me laugh.
I find you funny.
Yikes.
Yes.
When you're worried about something.
You're funny.
You think too much.

Of course it is.

I am sheik bin-Khalid's living son.
Only god will decide when I die.
"Now, put your gun away."
We have work to do.
You shouldn't be here.
Yeah.
"Well, you hung up on me."
I was... worried.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Look at me.
You have to finish mixing the explosives.
Have you forgotten what these people did to you?
What they said about you with those other students?
Have you?
No.
"They destroyed your marriage, and now they're trying to destroy your career."
"No, no."
"Amira, please, stop."
Amira?
I knew you were lying to me.
"Oh, my god!"
He was the one you were texting?
"God, Amira."
You are sick!
You are a sick bastard!
I'm gonna tell everyone...
The door!
Lock the door!
If I catch even a whiff of you dog whistling these guys...
- Do you
- Get over there.
Get your hands on your head.
[Cloudy] Hold 'em up.
We told you people we were comin' back.
We're gonna keep comin' back here until you clean this bar up.
Keep your eye on your neighbor.
"If he drops something, it belongs to you."
"What is this, a fuckin' hospital here?"
Huh?
"- Turn around there, fella."
"- What do we got here, huh?"
This belong to you?
Huh?
"Stand up there, ""noddy."""
Get your hands on your fuckin' head.
Get in there!
"- You wanna take a ride there, fat man?"
"- Oh, bullshit."
Huh?
Pay attention.
We're gonna ask questions later.
Turn around.
[Man Whispering] Fuckin' bullshit.
"All right, shut up there."
Shut up!
Anybody want a milk shake?
"All right, come over here."
You... and you.
"Hey, whiskers!"
Come over here.
- Move ass when I call you.
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
Yes.
Don't worry; the shorts won't fit him!
That's his problem!
So?
He's been following me!
Following you?
!
Don't worry!
I'll fix him!
Keep this...
Make a hole in this and have it.
Okay?
I'm secretary to Bhardwaj and Bhardwaj the name is Banwarilal Pandit.
Have you seen the woman?
Which woman?
The well-endowed one.
She was...
Are you talking about Laxmi?
You know her?
You are God-sent!
I am God-sent and I'll give you some of God's offerings now!
You tease women in our area!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Have you no womenfolk at home?
"How are you, Shantabai?"
Are they having a fight there?
Yes.
Which is why I've brought these coconuts for you.
Make a hole in this and have it.
I know that.
"But, aunt..."
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.
Excuse me.
Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton.
I'll wager he will do so in less than a fortnight.
Dear Edward...
Hello there!
Sir John...
Dear ladies!
Upon my word!
Here you are!
"- Sir John, your kindness..."
- None of that!
"Hush, please!"
"Here is my dear mamma-in-law, Mrs. Jennings."
You must be Mrs. Dashwood.
Was yourjourney tolerable?
Poor souls!
Why did you not come up to the park first?
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John.
We cannot...
No refusals!
I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!
Let us settle in.
Good night.
I see...
So this is the lowest layer.
"You say the two of them are here, right?"
Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.
The two Dangaioh pilots are in my custody.
"Boy, I'm in trouble now."
Wake up.
Both of you wake up!
"Are you okay, Big Brother?"
Kaori...
Hurry and get out there!
Burst and Flail are ready to go.
What on earth happened?
I'll explain later.
Just hurry!
"Hitomi, hang in there!"
"Chidou, you okay?"
Where the hell were you?
You ready to transform?
Am I ready?

"Come on, we'll give it back to 'em twice as hard!"
Here we go!

- You're home early.
- Is that a problem?
- No
- No?
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
"Oh,my."
They're gorgeous.
But why?
Tonight is your night.
You're going to be hearing a lot of speeches from people and...
I'm not going to bore you with one of my own.
I'm just...very proud of you.
"Jeff,there's something I need to tell you."
- sara.
- Hi.
"Senator,we still have to meet with the governor's people."
And security's now requested we arrive an hour earlier.
Thank you.
You should get ready.
Was there something...?
No.
"Later,when it's,um... when it's just us."
All right.
Shall we?
Okay.

The bomb.
The Nautilus has first strike capability and is not far offshore.
"You scare me, Mansley."
You want us to bomb ourselves in order to kill it?
"General, the giant seems to follow whatever attacks it."
"We can lure it away from the town, then destroy it."

"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little, teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"Yeah, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah.
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
Sure I can.
I'll be right back.
"Gingy, Gingy..."
"Run, run, run as fast as you can, if you want to remain a gingerbread man!"
"Oh, Gingy."
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.
"- Oh, well, I..."
- It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!
"No, no, no!"
Don't try harder!
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.
I can be pretty!
Really pretty.
The girl of your dreams.
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!
Gingy!
"Let go, Gingy!"
"Fall with me, so we can be together forever!"
Here's a thought.
You let go!
Together.

I am not having drinks with you.

I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
What we need is someone who's attractive but not too expensive.
Someone who's not too bright but brave enough to be casual about frostbite!
"Mr Arkwright, could you come a minute?"
Julie!
Little Jelly Tot Julie!
"Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982!"
Ho--ho!
"Hey, sh--she might even do it for sweets!"
Can you...
Can you get me out?
"What are you doing inside that, Granville?"
It's got me by the dangler!
How very inconvenient for you!
"I was so busy trying to keep me fingers out of the way, I forgot about me dangler!"

"- Anything I can do, Mr Arkwright?"
"Funny you should say that, Jelly...er, Julie."
-

"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
We've got your number.
Hey.
Mother of mercy.
"Yeah, we were just leaving."
I don't blame you.
Who is this guy?
A very colorful dead end.
"Hey, where's Natalie?"
She's downstairs.
"Oh, she's signing autographs."
"You hate this, don't you?"
What?
Natalie getting all the attention.
No.
I'm happy for her.
Sure you are.
It's good for her.
She deserves it.
Long overdue.
It's driving you crazy.
I can tell.
You used to be the superstar.
"Now, you're Garfunkel."
I'm not Garfunkel.
You're Garfunkel and you can't stand it.
I'm not Garfunkel.
I'm not Garfunkel.
Congratulations to all you winners.
We'll see you Monday night for the biggest super jackpot in lotto history.
$212 million.

You'll thank me later.
Are you parents divorced?
My mom is dead
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there...?
Just some kids.
At school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
"I never see you.... ...Owen, listen."
...What...?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't ...There are three
Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare And then they'll stop.
...What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah...
But what if that didn't stop them?
I'll help you.
But..
You're a girl...
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am
...I have to get in there...!
...Move Move...
- Mr. Zoric...?
"- Yes, Owen?"
I was wondering.
About the after school strength training?
Can people still sign up?
...You like to get strong?
Okay.
Four o'clock.
"Human stuff, huh?"
"Hey, let me see."
Oh!
Oh!
Look at this.
Wow.
This is special.
"This is very, very unusual."
- What?
What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See?
Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
"- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt."
- [Both] Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
"So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music."
Allow me.
- [Scuttle coughs]
- Music!
- It's stuck!
"- Oh, the concert!"
"Oh, my gosh!"
My father's gonna kill me!
"Measured out the, uh, minerals left behind, you know?"
"The iron phosphates, the..."
Whatever it is we're made up of.

You believe that?
"Yeah, I guess so."
$4.40.

"Two, in an SUV."
I saw them drive up.
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.
- Curved Kelly.

Anything more specific?
"It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe."
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height?
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."

The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.
He would not give them to anybody.
Stay with me.
You'll be safe.
"Come on, let's go."
My God!
Let's go.
Come on.
They've checked the entire floor.
There's no one in there.
"No body, nothing."
"The secretary said a Russian guy showed up, asked her boss a lot of questions."
Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.
"The next thing she knew, the place was on fire."
Have you gone through every place of debris in the office?
- We'll keep looking.
- Good.
He was adopted by a Russian family.
Sir...
I saw every Inspector Chamforth picture there ever was.
Just used to go right back and watch them again.
Oh!
"You see, someone has made a mistake."
A simple mistake that could be easy to miss.
Yes!
Oh!
"Sir, I need to wire my mom."
There's our secret weapon.
Now you write him in.
No excuses and no bar bills.
God bless America.

"Well, he's very handsome."
Oh!
Cmon!
So what's an American doing in Dunkirk?
No.
Scrub that.
What isn't he doing?
Fighting.
Yeah.
So what does that make him?
Appeased?
Now we need a hero.
"I don't know, umm...travel writer...journalist?"
Journalist!
Hard boiled wise cracking Yankee hack who compile it to both heroically.
No.
You're not pinching any more action from Rose and Lily.
I'm...
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.

We bare in public.
Oh I see.
What is the story with those guys anyways?
"Are they- they are very special to each other, yes."
"Uh-huh, like what?"

- Where are you going?
We are just going on an outing.
Going to Nainital.
The vehicle has broken down.
And it will take 2 to 3 days.
"So, don't know about the train."
"So we thought of going by bus, from the highway."
Very good!
Enjoy yourselves.
It's your age.

What about us?
We are old now.
How much?
Not everywhere.
Damn it.
I got nothing.
That's because it's not down here.
Shhh!
"Blair, give me the gun."
No.
Well then give Riley the gun.
My gun.
"Yeah, it's his gun."
"Now look, I'm making an executive decision here."
"We're gonna go after this sick fuck, and we're gonna take him out."
Are you fucking kidding me?
We just saw what he's capable of.
I'm not going after him with one bullet.

I found something.
I bet you the jammer's down here.
No.

Send out the scouts.
"Yes, sir!"
This is war at last...!
"On April 13, 1592, some seven hundred Japanese warships appeared on the coast of Pusan."
It was the advance guard of Chosun invasion Konishi Yukinaga's fleet.
This was its beginning of the brutal seven-year war between
Chosun and Japan...
Jakbo.
"Yes, Dae-man?"
Isn't that Su-chang from the shipyard?
Yes.
He's trying to get himself killed!
"Hey, Su-chang!"
Are you crazy?
Where did you get that uniform?
Did you steal it?
"I knew you weren't normal when you took a hammer to a warship, but..."
Did he just hit me?
Jakbo.
Yes?
"I'm right, right?"
Yup.
Dae-man!
- Did you hear the news?
- What news?
The high commander made that boy a commander!
"Starting today, Su-chang is a commander!"
Come again?
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"

"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
- Where's the keys?
- Over there.
Hi there.
Anybody hurt in this wreck?
I thought I told you to get plastic folders for this stuff.
Your scrapbook is like you.
- A mess.
"- Give me my pants, will you?"
Come on.
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds.
Mulderig and Klein.
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys,... ..and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap."
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.

I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
Wait a minute.
Dad... what is it?
"That sweater, Zoe."
Whose sweater is that?
It's my friend's.
He lent it to me.
"""He""?"
"Oh, no."
No.
Are you hanging out with boys?
"Zoe, I've had this talk with you before."
All boys are bad.
All of them.
"Yes, Dad, yes."
Seriously?
"I gotta go, okay?"
I love you.
"- I love you, too."
- I love you.
"Bye, bye-bye."
My dad always says never judge a book by its cover.
"Take Pin, for example."
"The guy looks like he swallowed a bag of lemons... but underneath it all, he's surprisingly..."
"Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief, after all."

Pin... what have you done?

Previously on 24...
"Six months ago, U.S. Special Forces launched an assault on the compound of Ibrahim Bin-Khalid, killing him and eight members of his terrorist organization."
Bin-Khalid's people found us.
Where is it?
"A strongbox that belongs to Sheik Bin-Khalid, taken from his compound the night your squad came and killed him."
Carter?
I get 22 in hand after TDS.
"Sairu, can we talk later?"
"What happened, lady-killer?"
Got scared?
Yeah?
- Look carefully.
- At what?
"Nose, it's like mom."
"Smile, it's like dad's I think."
"I'm an awesome combination, yeah?"
Yeah?
Absolutely awesome.

Okay?

"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:
"""Dan."""
Sort of.
- Sort of?
"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
- There is something decadent.
- Only in the entire universe ...
It is cool the actors Simon.
You will have you.
- It's great what he says.
I want the book.
- Leave me.

- Who was I?
- Who you had?
- Tu.
I love you.
"You know, I love you."
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.
The return when I want.
Do not go!
"No, I must follow!"
You need to do evil to survive?
- Even a child?
"- Not a child, it's worse."
And you can count on him.
Have a wonderful trip.
"Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen."
"OK, I'll try."
Ace!
(doorbell rings)
It's open!
- I'm just about to leave for Paris.
- I know.
Camilla told me.
- I'm here for the keys.
- Keys?
Of course.
I'm really confused.
- I'd better show you around.
- Yeah.
Didn't get much of a tour the last time.
"That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours."
"You can make up a different system if you want, you and..."
Camilla.
"Jesus, Johan!"
What are you doing here?
You never called.
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I lost your number.
"I tried to find it, but..."
I don't know what annoyed me most.
Him appearing from nowhere.
Again.
Or him sharing my flat with Camilla.
(traffic noises from outside)
(heavy breathing)
-No worries.
You never know.
See you.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Looking for an apartment...
There is no housing.
I have no money.
You've got the documents?
No.
"Come on, get out!"
Line!
You do not have to look for here.
How long was it?
-10 Minutes.
-Just.
"In barely 10 minutes later I noticed the ad, intercepted, searched and forced him out of the neighborhood."
"I'm not ga over there look, it's over."
We can go.
-OK.
Here we go.
"Listen, it's not complicated."
"I want 4 grenades, 3 electrical detonators and 5 kg of explosives."
Explosives?
What kind?
-C4.
Got it or not?
I've got everything.
But it will give you 5 pounds?
You want to breathe the air of Paris?
You are right.
Better that nothing not talking.
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.

And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.

I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.

- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
"Madam, nobody has arrested you."
Now please go home.
"If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police."
"Very well, then."
Where would I get a Mickey Finn?
I haven't the faintest idea.
"There you are, you see?"
"Come, Cedric."
What are you waiting for?
Come along.
"Ethel, come on!"
"Sergeant, where would one get a Mickey Finn?"
"I haven't the faintest idea, sir."
(Creaks)
- Good evening.
- (Gasps)
Must you keep jumping out?
You seem to have jumped in.
What on earth...?
- I...
I got caught in a storm.
- It hasn't been raining.
It was raining where I was.
Cats and dogs.
"- And mud, I see."
"- Yes, I must brush that off."
"By the way, one of your girls has been telephoning."
Really?
Which one?
I mean...
What do you mean?
She had a twangy voice and refused to give her name.
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise, you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"""Snow..."
"""Beard..."
"Grace."""
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
"In the woods."""
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."""
Pine Street.
It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah, and the kicker is, it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out, not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well, let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc, give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
- Forget him.
Ain't nobody watching you but me.
All right ?
Now show me some attitude.
"MissJohnson, we don't have time for this."

"Yeah, it's pretty good."
"Well, I know they got all these famous dance teachers and shit, but ifyou need some new moves, you know, some real flavor, you know who to call."

Let us know!
Addons
- Repeat the question.
"- No, that's good."
"I say that the test is the mistress, sadist."
I know.
That's why I was good.
But that stupid test.
I make time to go.
The test was wrong?
Is not it?
Well ...
"I'm not sadistic, implies that if."
"Your answer was given to Addons and results, but lying a few questions, right?"
I do not know ...
"I have not taken seriously, to be honest."
Addons This is a question to the 4 ...
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
Forbidden!
Officer!
This wheel didn't understand ifs forbidden area!
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
"It's rolling, rolling, rolling up to there."
Itjust happened.
Now you come down and give it to me!
I can't come down!
It's forbidden!
Go.
So I am coming in by myself to pick it up then I will go!
Are you going to come in?
!
It is forbidden.
No way!
Go.
Go.
So I would bowstring to get it.
"It's not forbidden for this rope, is it?"
Where are you from?
Bushehr_
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
- Where are you going to go?
- Tan
Tangak!
- Where are you going?
- I am just gonna get some water.
It's out of water then
That's it.
There is no water inside it.
"You love it, don't you?"
What?
The thrill of a new case.
I'll see you around.
Don't fall for your target.
What are you watching?
Ooh.
Porn?
"No, it's just something for this case."
Mm.
I'll get it out of you.
Right.
Oh!
You're late.
"Yeah, I had to meet someone first."
Mm-hmm.
"Someone tall, ruggedly handsome, carries a gun?"
Keep your enemies close.
"Yeah, I'll bet you kept him close."
Duly and diligently.
Hey.
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Wouldn't miss it.
Morgan was one of our favorite clients.
Yeah.
"You know, the day we met at his place was the day he died."
"Yeah, we heard that."
"Sorry he had to go through it alone, you know?"
"Oh, he wasn't alone."
"Well, no man is an island."
We are all... connected.
Right.
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.

Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.

Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
-Yes.
-Look.

"Ivan Semenovich, may I go out for a second?"
-No problem.

And then the red one.
That's all.

-Aren't you on duty?
- There is a replacement.
Let's go.
"Saidov, stay here."
Sidorenko!
-Why are you silent?
"-Yeah, this hill has to be stormed."
Towards a dawn the situation was even badder unfortunately.
It was silence however on the next night.
"A little sawing was heard, they did not pay attention to him."
Nothing disturbed their dream on this night.

"Look, lady."
"Officially, this case is closed."
That's understood.
The circumstantial evidence points to an inside job.
"The aunt's a nut, but she's clean."
No one else will buy a nine-year-old doing all this.
Hasn't he ever been checked out psychologically?
"They checked him out at social services, but he passes with a clean bill of health."
"Squeaky clean, beyond suspicion."
I need to see those police reports.

"Of the 45 passengers on board, nine belonged to the same family."
All from Haiti.
So?
So they're afraid of getting fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.
"I explained to them that doesn't exist here, but they're scared, even still."
They set up a committee.
This is leading by example?
"It's not for us, stupido."
It's for the clients.
They're allowed to have pudding on their spa day.
It's like a -- a last hurrah before the real work starts.
[ Sighs ]
Get to work.
"Hey, Frank."
Frank:
Yeah?
We need to order more asparagus.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
Mm.
What do you know?
"Looks like it's my ""spa day,"" too."
[ Chuckles lightly ]
[ Tranquil music plays ]
Sam:
"Okay, good job, guys."
"Go to, uh..."
Downward dog.
[ Grunts ] Hold for five minutes.
[ Exhales sharply ] Five minutes?
It's usually 30 seconds.
Right.
"Yeah, 30 seconds."
That's what -- that's what I mean.
"Okay, uh, I'll just come around, make sure everybody's form is okay, make sure you're, uh, keeping your cores tight, and, uh, your --"
"uh, good job."
Great.
Straighten that back out.
Shining City.
"All right, Tom."
"Step out of the truck for me, please."
Sure.
"- Open up the back for me, please."
- Sure.
All right.
"Heel, bud."
[Dog Whines]
[Dog Sniffing]
Jesus.
That smell is worse than the shit it covers up.
Yeah.
- Have a good night.
- You too.
"Come on, buddy."
[Shouting In Spanish]
Keep an eye in front and behind you.
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Off the road!
Take a knee!
- [Spanish Continues]
- Keep your weapons facedown.
[Gunfire In Distance]
We're SEALs.
We're supposed to know how to use a firearm.
If you had taught him how to load that thing... there wouldn't have been an accidental discharge.
The guy nearly blew my foot off.
It's like my 12-year-old sister handling a gun.
"No, my sister actually handles a gun better than these contras."
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."
Sure.
Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
"""Gals""?"
"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
Previously on Fringe:
- There is more than one of everything.
OLIVIA:
Who the hell is this guy?
BROYLES:
We've recorded him at over three dozen scenes all of which relate to the Pattern.
- Why?
What is he doing?
BROYLES:
Watching.
Observing.
- We refer to him as the Observer.
WALTER:
"We were dead, Peter."
Until someone grabbed me.
"We were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met."
- You talked to him?
WALTER:
He wouldn't be any use.
He just observes.
I have said too much.
I am not supposed to get involved.
MAN:
Nice specs.
I've never seen anything like them before.
They're from somewhere far away.
I don't have any money.
"Oh, that's okay."
I'm gonna give you one of these anyway.
There.
"Oh, that's great."
Thank you.
I remember something like that.
"I like to poke Michael, because..."
You're so cute when you flinch.
When you recoil with horror.
"Poke, poke, poke."
- Here's some hotness.
- These guys are good.
- Sexy.
- Great chemistry.
"I don't know why, but these guys..."
"They, like, auditioned together, right?"
Norah!
Norah!
Norah!
"Oh, my God, Pete."
This is that crazy shot where they had like...
"They put the wall back, remember?"
"When it goes all the way around, someone was putting the wall back."
- Really?
"- Yeah, it was like a 3-D shot."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- This one was...
This was cake icing on my hand.
- It was?
- Yup.
- It looked like paint.
- Have a sweet dessert.
"- After this, you licked your fingers?"
- I licked that wall.
Check out Mike's performance here.
"Oh, well, there's a..."
What?
"Yes, my lord."
She is quite important to me.
Too important.
- Master...
- Silence.
I can sense her powers growing stronger.
I would hate to think you are training your own sith... apprentice to destroy me.
Never.
My allegiance is to you and you alone.
Then you must prove it.
Eliminate her.
She's my most trusted...
I said eliminate her!
"As you wish, my lord."
Ventress.
Split up.
Looks like I'm her favorite.
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.
You want to race?
Come on.
I'm going to need some help.
Where are you?
I'm hit!
I'm heading toward the separatist flagship.
I see you.
I've got her.
"Master, I need your help quickly."
I'm surrounded.
"You have already lost the battle, child."
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.
No.
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.

Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.

"If you become Tahir's woman, it will make you safe."

You cannot save everyone.
That's what Bakri said.
"But saving even one person, surely, would be something."

- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.
Get the hell out of here.
boss?
- Fuck off.
Go!
You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
I will kill you honourably at dawn tomorrow.
With any weapon you prefer.
You wish to fight me?
You have stolen my lady's affections.
- I wish the chance to avenge myself.
- GEORGE:
Mallefille!
No!
"Very well, monsieur."
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
Let's go back.
This is ridiculous.
"What, run for my hole like a rabbit?"
I could never respect myself afterwards.
"Nor could you, Aurora."
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.
- Eugene.
- It's too late.
He's in love.
Monsieur.
Madame.
Welcome.
The doctor is here.
These are my seconds.
The sun is rising.
Shall we go?
Please.
I wonder...
Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- Don't hurt him.
Aim at the clouds.
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."

[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
Better than you posing as a Japanese!
"Damn Robin, I quit."
Gosh...
Something terribly important is missing.
What did you lose?
I lost a toothbrush!
I'm not kidding. it's an heirloom.
Passed on through the generations.
For good fortune. lt's very important.
I'm afraid I'll have to search you all.
"Right, stealing right under the Commissioner."
And Inspector Robin's nose.
It's really too much!
"I agree to a search, I'll go first."
"Yes, I approve of a search!"
No need for you.
"Dumplings, you do it!"
"Oh yes please, come!"
Not him. I meant her.
- Inspector Robin!
- Sir!
You're responsible for security tonight.
"If you don't find the toothbrush, I'll have your head!"
Yes.
- Fools!
- Yes sir!
Get away.
Salute!
- Body search!
- Yes sir!
Hurry up!
"If we can't find it, I'm done."
Why would he fight back for that bit of money?
"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.

"Mr. Lin, this way please."
Enjoy your dinner here.
All these for the two of us?
All your brother's favourites.
"David, simple meals will do next time."
Don't waste food.
Yes.
Hi!
Lincoln.
Remember me?
This is Roger and Mr. Law.
Hi!
We met before.
Your brother introduced us last time.
I must have been drunk and left early.
Pity your brother has passed away.
We missed him.
Our condolences.
Thank you!
We're having boating party next week.
You brother will never miss it.
You must join us.
"Let's have fun, okay?"
I'll check my schedule and see.
Alright.
See you.
"I'll see you out, Mr. Law."
Why bother?
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
I miss the track team.
And I miss the basketball team.
We have no time for other sports.
Lacrosse is hard enough.
Forget it.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu all of a sudden?
Are you at all interested in lacrosse?
"Showing up late, and all."
Bringing your weird friends.
You're a bit strange yourself.
"""My name Minmin."""
Can you play lacrosse?
You use this?
It's for throwing the ball.
This is no good.
You must control the ball.
Shoot at the goal.
"Oh, OK."
It's quite difficult.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey!
help!
I need help!
Hey!
"please, help me!"
What am I to do?
Task Force 7 needs more students adept in martial arts.
select a few students.
Request payment by wire.
And the other request?
We've dispatched 3 students.
Payment is complete.
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
Fine.
I'll do it.
Okay.
What are doing?
Are you mental?
Put it down.
Put it down.
Let go.
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down.
I got it.
"Billy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Stan, I can't work with this guy."
"What, you can't work with me?"
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
I've been here for eight years.
And you're just another untalented pretty face.
"Billy, calm down."
"Untalented, huh?"
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.
"That has nothing to do with you, you moron."
Billy!
I've warned you before about your attitude.
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""

"Hey, what did they say when they seen you with all them stripes?"
"A master sergeant, huh?"
"They really flipped, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
Henshaw wants to say hello.
"Hey, I was next!"
"By rank, Doberman."
By rank.
Wow.
I get it.
"You are a trip, Ms. Sciuto."
"That's a good thing, right?"

What now?
Where is Baylor and who shot Ridgeway?
Wickes might be able to tell us if we ask nicely.
I'll ask.
I've seen your nice.
I'm going with you.
You said man-to-man.
Oh.
"Right, I'm sorry, we haven't met."

We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.

- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.

I'm serious.
I love this color...

You're putting me on.
Wow!
Your eyes are the color of this bay!
"Man, you're weird."
They are!

Our whole future depends on it.
(Chuckles)
Forgive me.
I was getting rid of my daughter.
Getting rid of people seems to be a hobby of yours.
Eh?
!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
"Oh, no."
"For once, I think I won't."
- Oh...
- Please sit down.
Business before pleasure.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Let's go.
"You really don't believe that we have met before, right?"
Not at all.
But this bloody thing...
believes in everything you say.
This understands that just to save my life you agreed to marry a joker.
I don't know about your past life.
But in this life...
I love you so much that I can handle ten such villains for you.
Look!
Look!
Look!
There's another one!
Lovejoy's love rain.
What happened?
Full moon?
What...?
- Let's go.
- Where?
Hurry up!
Where are you taking me?

Good evening.
"If your adventure trip is over, shall we leave?"
"Find it, or in five days,"
Serena Price drowns in Black Pine Cove.
"Good morning, muffin."
I'm fancier than a muffin.
I'm a croissant.
I know what kind of croissant you are... ham and cheese!
A vegetarian can't be ham and cheese.
I'm chocolate.
"Two chocolate croissants, please."
- Coming right up.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- I'll go get some.
Yay!
"Hey, you know you're gonna have to make them yourself when we run away to Fiji."
Did you get that call yet from your office about...
I've got my Aplus investigators on it.
"Gonna hear something soon, okay?"
I will be right back.
Yay!
"We love you, Mommy."
Love you guys.
Sorry.
"No, no."
Hey!
Serena!
"Serena, did somebody come in here?"
A messenger was here.
He brought something for Daddy.
- What?
- A yellow envelope.
"You know, like this."
Then I'll have one more.
Please do!
Your Highness is right.
I'll leave for a bit.
"Perhaps when I'm gone, you'll win your next game of chess."
"Please excuse me, Your Highness."
Please!
Disgusting!
Disgusting!
"What a smart guy, please!"
Please!
"Mr. Law, you want more wine?"
How are you?
Check!
Good move!
Are you alright?
Are you alright?
This wine can stimulate warriors.
I think it's just the opposite.
You want the antidote?
I assume your offer depends on what I offer.
What's your intention?
Wu-tang 8-divine Sword!
"Give me the book, or you'll suffer more."
Check!
"Mr. Law, you have lost!"
Speak!
You'll tell me sooner or later.
Tell us!
What?
Don't be nervous!
You're losing so badly!
Come.
Panju.
Who is it?
Manoj?
Yes.
"Yes, that's me."
And you are?
We are coming from Kanyakumari police station.
We want some details.
Is there a problem?
Shall we talk inside?
"Okay, come in."
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
Send for my chopper.
I can take 3.
Coming along?
I'm staying.
MacDANIEL:
"I see them, Dai Uy."
NIM:
Pardon me.
PETERSEN:

Fall out!
[SERGEANT SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE]
HAMCHUNK:
Petersen!
PETERSEN:
Charlie's building caskets and ladders.
A lot of them.
How far away?
About 15 clicks.
That gives us plenty to do before they get here.
Restrict all operations to within 4 clicks of the camp.
- Will systems be operational by dark?
- Affirmative.
"May I suggest we contact ""C"" Team?"
See about the weather.
- Petersen?
- Yeah.
What was all that about ladders and coffins?
"When Charlie knows he's got a nice box to be buried in, he's just as brave as hell."
The ladders?
They throw the ladders across the wire to get at us.
Later they use them for litters.
You have to think about the political aspect.
"They here, however."
-They are already bankrupt.
I was not finished talking.
M r.
"Borgen, you've got a phone from Norway."
They say it's personal.
Do you have a privacy?
Put them over.
Can you please go?
-Hallo?
-Hi.
Aksel?
Aksel Nilsen?
-Who is it?
-William Hansteen.
-Are you there?
-Yes.
How are you?
Do you know Solar Tech?
-Why do you ask?
-Old Lifjord Mechanical.
We leave on the solar cell production a few years ago.
-We have lost an important contract.
-Scanbrazil?
You have the interests of the market for alternative energy.
We are facing a breakthrough on 4G.
If I sent you ...
-We are not interested.
-How can you say that?
I see there are Eva who is controlling the company now.
"Yes, I met a little wall after what happened with Karine."
they're on a boat
Near the south side pier...
"the heartbreak, dock 12."
Who is this?
Just a pal.
Tell me you na...
how did you get this number?
Have a lovely night.
Right.
Very good.
Who was that?
Anonymous tip.
Let's go.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
That didn't take long.
Oh.
Thought you were someone else.
Brannis told me one of you would be coming.
One of me?
Would it make a difference if I told you I won't make it easy?
Yeah.
"He told me that, too."
What did you do?
What did you do to my arm?
Aah!
"Well, that works."
Not if you want a massage.
Jarvis:
I imagine that'll be your colleagues.
We must go.
We can't leave him here.
He's a witness.
-You're not trained.
-Since when?
I meant you're not trained to work as part of this team.
There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.
My mentor.
My king.
I thought he trusted me.
Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.
They've got a secret H.Q. in space.
What else aren't they telling us?
I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?
What is Project Cadmus?
Don't know.
But I can find out.
COMPUTER:
Access denied.
-Heh.
Wanna bet?
Whoa.
How are you doing that?
Same system as the Batcave.
COMPUTER:
That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...
"- Hey, come back!"
- Prostitute to get rid of this thief!
"- Stop, Give me that wallet!"
- Give the man his wallet!
"- He worked hard for the money, g.t guy!"
"- You worked hard, right?"
- Hold on there.
Do not fucking move!
- Fuck man!
Hello?
What's going on there?
- Want to play?
- Listen.
As for the last case?
"Laboratory, was caught in a match."
"- Mason, have checked the records."
You were right about the delivery.
- Where do I said that?
"- Yes, the better."
I received a delivery address in person.
1132 Orchard Glen Park Road.
- John ...
- Flee!
Jesus Christ man!
We take a look at dirt.
What are you doing?
"Yes, I hazırlıyorsun papers."
I love the computer.
"A real angel of death, believe me."
"Yes, I'd be more optimistic than we used to."
"Okay, Pete."
"All gone, tell him."
- Well ...
It's because of the surgery.
Do you think?
Yes.
I don't know.
How would you feel if you had undergone such an operation?
I don't know.
She is not like our mother.
Play it again.
Loads of kisses from me.
I can't wait to be back.
Pull up your blankets and close your eyes.
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
Goodnight.
Get mom.
Mom?
Lukas?
Lukas?
- Hello?
"- Hi, good morning."
That was a huge order.
So many at the same time.
- Throwing a party?
- No.
Who are all those pizzas for?
"Pepperoni, Pepperoni?"
Is that your favorite?
Pepperoni pizza.
- No problem.
Good luck.
Can't push the chair.
- Hey.
LAURA:
"Hey, Johnny."
KELLY:
How was the ski trip?
LAURA:
"Oh, yeah, it was fun."
- You knock them dead?
- I never got you out there.
That was always a big regret for me too.
- Does Greg Medavoy seem off his game?
- Why?
He seems a little depressed.
"- Yeah, he's got a domestic situation."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Do you want to go out for dinner?
"- Sure, what's the occasion?"
- No occasion.
"- Okay, your call."
- Tonight?
- Fine.
- I'll talk to you later.
See you later.
Martinez will be with you at arraignment.
We think you'll get a recognizance release.
He'll see you home.
It's better if you carry me down.
"Yeah, the chair nearly went over coming up."
Let's pick him up.
Some of the kids at school told the police...
-...that you and Taylor didn't get along.
-Yeah.
But I never wanted to kill her.
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
[SIGHS]
A couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you happen to smell anything?"
"Anything, like what?"
Like rotten eggs or sulfur?
No.
"Okay, um...."
Did you notice any black smoke?
"What, are you crazy?"
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
The way she talked about being there mentally but not physically.
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
-Kind of?
-She didn't see any black smoke.
Or smell sulfur.
Maybe she's not a demon.
Kids can be vicious.
"Well, I mean, we're already here, might as well check out the school."
Right.
The school.
-What?
"-Truman High, home of the Bombers."
I like pain of every kind.
Needles through my nipples.
Needles in my back.
I've had two needle corsets.
"Blows of all kinds, with marks, without marks."
Slaps.
"Verbal humiliation, being scolded."
That sort of thing.
I can free my mind.
totally let go.
And simply enjoy.
Simply be myself.
It's wonderful.
I need it.
Bend over it.
Spread your feet.
As wide as you can.
Nice.
- Do you like whips?
"- Yes, Master Walter."
Count out loud.
- One.
- Good.
Two.
Three.
I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up!
Shut up.

You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
"Take it, son."

Column dismissed!
Not you Sharpe
Take your men up that slope and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow.
"Well, you heard him."
Yeah.
"Would you, please, be so kind to describe them... to better understanding of how good it looks now?"
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the elbow... and the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."
"His eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shredded to pieces."
Just all right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little extraneous.

"To be honest, I was starting to think that you were a mute."
I wanna see Maria!

Morning.
I've come for Peter.
He's my son.
You want it.
Yeah.
Why can't you get better for me?
We had so much and it's all fucked up forever.
I'm so lonely.
I know.
Do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
Of course.
That's what love feels like.
What are you doing?
Lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
We're not...
Not in the way you're thinking.
Effy?
What's wrong?
It keeps happening.
OK.
Lie down.
- Do you mind?
- No.
"I like this story, anyway."
Thanks.

Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.

I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.

-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.
Jealous?
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!

No need.

But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!
- Useless...
- Reporting for duty!
Stop!
Make way!
Where do you think you're going?
What are you doing?

"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
"Right now, I'd like to see the chain the dog"
Was wearing in the park.
Greta's leash?
Why?
Mm.
"Grasping at straws, I guess..."
Nothing for you to worry about.
"Well, OK."
Sure.
OTIS:
"How is she, Greta?"
AUDREY:
"Oh, fine."
Maybe a little more restless than usual.
[Snarling]
Here it is.
What's important about the leash?
"Oh, nothing probably."
"You know, I'm just checking on anything."
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
"It's an occupational hazard at my age, I guess."
Probably a lot of sinus too.
There's a lot of dust in the air today.
"Well, let me get you some aspirin."
Oh.
"If you would, uh, think this will be better."
"If it's a little seltzer, if you'd dump it in a small glass"
"Of water, please."
Sure How about some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
No thanks.
Biggie was as rough as you're now!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Don't come back without the money!
"""Pochilam"""
Which one is Huang Fei-hung?
- Excuse me...
- I'm the king fu instructor for the navy!
What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
I'll get the money tomorrow.
You focus on the arrangements.
Are you done with the hospital arrangements?
I came here after paying the advance amount.
My brother's friends are with him at the hospital.
He is repeatedly asking to meet you.
"Once the transplantation is done,"
I will be the first person to meet him.
She is cooking a story to rob him.
Priya?
Are you crying?
"Thanks for being there, Vikram."
Be strong.
I'll be there for you.
Your company is all I need.
Everything will go smoothly.
Who is this woman?
!
Even I want to fall in love with her!
I'll pay.
What's your lover Vasundhara saying?
"Start, start..."
Go closer!
Follow them.
"You, moron!"
We have to take the other route now.
Move...
- Idiot.
- We lost them!
"Panju, call Alphonse."
I'm not able to reach him.
Bye.
Possible.
After my careful analysis...
Possible?
No way.
"Excellent judgement, Marshal."
I traveled far for White Tiger.
So I leave this insignificant case to you.
I'll hold you responsible for your fail this.
Responsible?
Me?
Marshal!
You've come such a long way.
How about having dinner with me tomorrow.
Please...
We weren't invited to the restaurant's opening.
Why?
They've invited Huang Fei-hung.
Huang?
It's his birthday a couple days later.
Send him a birthday suit.
He'll like my suit for sure.
Is everything ready for my birthday?
"Everything is ready, Master."
Master...
A tailor's here to make a suit for you.
What?
Your birthday suit.
Show him in.
How come it's different tailor?
Ah To's away.
Let me take your measurement.
Fine.
"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.
Remorse.
Nice candy.
"'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones."
"Oh, God!"
Three big
- Three years?
Three hundred dollars.
What?
For the windshield.
"Plus, there's this little baby right here."
"You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts."
- This-
- This is a ticket.
- Yeah.
For operating a class-two vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.
Can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion.
- We're talking.
- There's nothin' on it.
My pen ran out of ink.
"Officer, i really must insist."
"From doing paperwork all night, between you and saving your boss."
- My boss?
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
How can something like this happen?
What are the chances?
"But they'll say, thanks to all those tonics, he survived."
I know.
But nothing appears to be wrong with the thermostat.
And I couldn't find anything wrong with the lights and the TV either.
Okay.
So what is it?
"Something strange is going on in this suite, Danny."
Not you too.
"Come on, Don."
[Scoffs]
Thirty-nine degrees.
"Your, uh, dairy storage is exemplary, Delinda."
I bet you say that to all the girls.
[Chuckles]
Whoa.
Sorry.
"Well, filters clean."
Ventilation good.
Everything looks perfect.
"So, uh, we passed?"
"Oh, with flying colors."
I'm not supposed to reveal that until the official report is issued.
It'll be our little secret.
[Chuckles]
"Okay, so..."
Just...
Just one more thing.
What's that?
"Um, I was wondering if you might have dinner with me some evening?"
"Oh, Mr. Ackerman."
"Oh, no."
"Call meJerry, please."
Jerry.
A jam in Los Angeles.
-Let me...
-No hydraulic fluid
-for the platform lifts.
-This is ridiculous.
You guys are making me laugh.
You call yourself truck operators.
"-What's your dram, hydraulic fluid?"
-Yeah.
"-Yeah, what are you driving, diesels?"
-That's right.
"Well, you simply drain the lube fluid out of the hitch gearbox, transfer it to the hydraulic lifts."
Look alive!
Stop jamming up the works out here!
-Get going!
-(phone ringing)
"-BILKO: $10,000 a year?"
"-Oh, $10,000."
That's nothing.
That's just the beginning.
You're worth a fortune to me.
"-Hello, hello!"
-I'm calling about the Dawson figures.
-What?
!
-Dawson figures-- I have to have 'em right away.
I got to get downstairs and sign some papers.
"-(overlapping chatter, phones ringing)"
-Go to it!
The Dawson figures.
What about the Dawson figures?
-(phone ringing)
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- Milan is amazing.
It'll change our lives.
Who is it?
It's Mario.
Guess where we are?
What?
I'll call you this evening.
Problems at work?
"Optimism, Silvia!"
- Yuck!
- Darn it!
- WELCOME TO THE SOUTH -
You can't do anything?
I've been working there for 15 years!
You promised!
You know I was counting on it.
I understand.
"It's not fair, though."
Bye.
Shoes!
"Naples: gunfire downtown,"
Minister Maroni in visit to the regional capital.
"102 deaths since the year began, 1,300 in the last ten."
It's as if an entire village were erased from the map.
- What is it?
- No transfer to Milan.
What?
Someone disabled got the job.
"To live in Milan, a person has to be handicapped?"
"They have priority, it's only right."
"Wasn't your friend ""Leave it to me"" Mario helping you?"
Liz:
The drug will take her soon.
Narcan.
Heroin antidote.
All the agents looking for you have it.
"[Gasps, coughing]"
"Liz Kenyon, you killed Kevin Whitfield, didn't you?"
I took him to protect him.
"Yeah, well, now I'm taking you."
[Police radio chatter]
[Handcuffs click]
James:
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
So why would you ever promise those parents you'd find his killer?
Because...
"They believed in him so much that it made me believe in him, too."
[Young woman coughs]
You're a hell of a lawman.
"Thank you, son."
So are you.
But I got to ask you to stay away from Gracie...
Until I figure this out.
Figure what out?
She's my granddaughter.
She misses me.
Yeah.
Because you died.
Just give me some time with this.
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
"So, this is Peng's."
Splendid.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
- Mumsie!
- I have it all worked out.
- I've recced his barge.
- Wrecked his barge?
!
"No, Reconnoitred."
He lives on a barge.
"- But, Mumsie..."
- Shh!
Hello?
Are you that Dennis creature?
This is Flora Ransom here.
I have your money.
Come and collect it at 7:30 tomorrow night.
"Now, you get the pills, I'll prepare the trunk."
"""Solder wire to hole marked Z."""
And that's that.
- Wonderful.
- Whatever's that?
"That, my friend, is the bomb completed."
Now for the gunpowder.
Get out my Indian army colonel with the overdraft clothes.
(Doorbell)
Mr MacGregor?
My name is Lord Mayley.
- Yes?
- We haven't met before but you're said to be a very decent sort.
- You're very kind.
- I'm sure you agree that we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
10!
10!
- 10 cardboards!
- Wonderful!
- Ugye?
- Great!
It was worthy.
"We struggled for him, but was worthy."
Where is the kind Tót?
He was it here yet before.
- Lajos.
- Daddy!
Do not sleep eternally.
#Girls!
Respectthe lad well.#
"I am glad that you have a so good mood, my dear Tót."
"I do not know it, how I shall express my gratitude."
"- Come on, major lord."
"- But yeah, yeah."
- I'm happy and satisfied.
- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?
!
Na!
Mariska!
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.
"Oh, Mother, thank you."
Thank you very much.
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.
"2676J, please."
"Hey, watch where you're going there, buddy, will you?"
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.
- I want it.
- You don't need any.
I want some!
"- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?"
"- No, thank you."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Betty and Rodney.
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!
"Master Fan, I've a secret to tell you!"
What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!
I'm here!
What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!
Do you remember a year ago
At the pharmacy?
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
Master!
Master!
Why did you kill Law Ching?
Why did you force my master to die at my sword?
I didn't force him!
Now I understand.
This is your filthy trick to get our book.
Nonsense!
It was the Shaolin!
Shaolin?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Why?
The poison your master drank is familiar to the Shaolin.
Shaolin temple!
Stop!
Sung Chi!
Execute him for the murder of his master.
"Your Highness, Law Ching has cheated you."
His student definitely knows 8-divine Sword.
Arrest him!
8-divine Sword?
Don't stop!
How are you?
Speak!
"Yes, or you'll have to suffer more!"
But I don't know 8-divine Sword.
How can I tell you?
"Your Highness, please stop!"
Why?
The man has the same temperament as his master.
He won't tell you even if you kill him.
"""Let me get intoxicated."""
"""I am young."""
"""Show me the magic."""
What are you thinking?
"You know, Gul."
Jaipur will be lonely without you.
And you?
I have become lonely.
It's very late.
I have to go home now.
Can't you cancel it?
What?
Going home?
Mumbai.
"- No way, Karan."
Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
"""With hasty regards, Tadao. """
"Grandma, it's a very good idea!"
"You should go, absolutely."
- Everybody to Hawaii!
- Wonderful!
- It will be a great holiday!
"- Grandma, let's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."

"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie. """
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from Clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.

We were in the same class.
But we did not go.

He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.

"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.

No...

- Huh?
- It was a night protection.

Stop.

Give that to me.
Look what you've done.
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."

"There are no miracles, Letha."
Only scientific explanations for everything.
"Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing."

And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.

Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"

What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?

It's all yours.
Delicious.
It's so delicious...
So delicious.
It really is delicious.
Sorry.
Welcome.
"Please press the button to select your room, then receive your key at the front desk."
Resting or staying overnight?
Overnight.
"Overnight is 14,000 yen, plus day fee of 5,800 yen."
Really?
That's the rule.
So expensive.
200 yen is your change.
"The girl's no good, she's not sexy and she's loose down there."
"Seriously, and she mentioned her dad is a cop, too."
Don't tell me you fell for her sob stories.
Where are you?
The bathroom.
Bet she's already stolen your stuff and left.
What?
First time?
Never done this?
Not for this reason.
No one here.
"Oh, an employee."
"""What are you doing here?"""
Not throwing it?
"Well, I just bought this phone."
Tired?
Hey there.
There is some problem.
Where are you going?
To have a smoke.
Pia.
"- Yes, sir."
Where is Gul?
- She must be around in the office.
Where is Adi?
He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.
"If she is not talented, sack her."
Throw her out.
You know we are short of time.
It is better you do this job.
"Yes, 'tell'."
Let's say 'tell'.
- Tell 'Tell'.
It's a great sauce.
This is mayonnaise.
This is vinaigrette with...
With garlic.
- Oh yes.
And this is 'Iyutenitsa'.
"It looks like ketchup, but it's natural."
Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.
Let's go home.
In ambulance.
"Ludovic, we have to stop shooting right away."
"Mr. Lloyd, that's enough."
"- Well, Louise."
Duncan filmed the trip.
Ludovic?
Sire?
- I would like to drive.
Excuse me?
Where did the husband spring from?
He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!
He's left on a pilgrimage.
That's wonderful!
A thorn out of my path!
But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!
Haribhai?
I'm in a hurry...
See you later.
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!
Who's throwing the litter around?
That's no litter...
Siraj!
What are you doing here?
And what's this?
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.
This set-up is my own.
Have you bought it then?
What's that?
A Hindu name?
"$10 million for exclusive distribution of island white,"
- ...in cash.
- $12 million.
- $15 million.
- $17.5 million.
I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."
- What?
Where?
- Here...
"Here, and..."
"Oh, my God."
- That's Amanda Kane.
- What has Finch done to her?
Looks like he's turned her into a human Guinea pig.
- I'm going in there.
- I'm riding shotgun.
I'll be your eyes and ears.
Meet your first and only customer.
- Who is she?
- She's nobody.
- She have a name?
- None she remembers.
Your narcotic's impressive.
Just keep looking.
Shadab!
Wait!
Don't beat!
- Faiz!
"- No, brother!"
Not today!
"Are you okay, brother?"
Brother.
"How's this blood, my brother?"
Brother.
Hold it!
"Please, hold it!"
"""This is love, not some revolt""."

Faiz!
Faiz!
"""Will die if separated""."
You have my promise!
"""People of love shall brighten""."
What did you think?
I am not a pawn in the chess game.
"That, someone's life should decide victory or loss."
"Sheen, don't stop me to day."
"You are bloodied angry, today."
"You are no more that Faiz, who I had loved."
How do you know?
I
Were you there?
It was tricked by lights guiding it into the rocks.
- To cause a shipwreck?
On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.
Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.
Who knows?
The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.
- What about you?
Were you there?
- Me?
No.
I was herel
"So, why have you got blood on your shirt?"
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.
God curse the wreckers!
The sun is rising over the shore!
A sad and gray day!
The tide is out!
I can see two small figures.
They are getting up!
- They start walking.
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- They are still weak.
They support each other and stagger forward.
Be warned.
Let him go.
Husband...!
Who are you and what do you want?
"I'm a local salt cooker named Pan-dong, sir."
And?
I came to give you an important information.
Could I possibly get my tax reduced in return?
What?
Is this a joke?
!
"No, no!"
You'll have a big problem in your hands unless something is done!
A big problem?
"Sir, are you all right?"
Thanks.
Be careful.
Arrest this man!
What is the meaning of this!
Let go!
We know what you've been going around doing.
I have done nothing wrong!
We'll find out once we get to the government canter.
Take him away!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Chun-su!
Something terrible has happened!
They arrested Soon-shin!
Pardon?
They might hurt him if we don't do something!
It's all right.
He's a noble.
"Now, we are famed for our seafood."
You what?
See food?
What's 'see food'?
"Fruits de mer, sir - cockles, whelks, crabs, mussels..."
Them shiny pebbles?
"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."
Two points for straight in?
Wicked.
And one point if it goes in off the backboard.
Backboard?
Do you mean me?
What are we calling this game?
How about...
'Get the ball in the jug'?
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or...
Jugball?
"Yes, jugball!"
You're a genius!
We should play every day.
Make it company policy.
"Right, yeah!"
Brilliant.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
That would be brilliant.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?
honey.
you know I will.
Hey.
what's up?
- How's it going? but it's tomorrow.
set it up.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in between your little palettes there?
all right then.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.
- What is it?
- l need some time off.
nothing like that.
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.
good.
Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
- Would you?
- Mm.
"And, well... kinky."
Filthy.
Just arseholes.
A pair of complete and utter kinked-up... filthy racist arseholes.
"We've just left a vulnerable young boy with a pair of not only instinctive killers, but heinous pervs."
You do realise I'm zipping my coat up and going back there?
"Yeah, and I'm coming with you."
Mitchell?
Yeah?
Mitchell?
Are you packing?
"Unpacking, still."
"Oh, boys."
Your phone rang.
"Oh, thank you."
It's a withheld number.
Which usually means something official.
"Like a job, say."
They've left a message.
- It won't be good news.
"- Oh, you don't know that."
- Put it on loudspeaker.
- Uh.
Go on.
"Please, please, please."
"Hello, John."
This is Nita Mawulawde.
- That's how you say it.
- Duh.
I'm calling in regard to your interview this morning.
-...on your memorable family experience.

"Just a reminder, though, this is going to be worth half your final grade."
Leave him alone.
WYATT:
Don't screw it up.
"-Shh, I'm going for a record."
WYATT:
"Um, what you write about...."
I said leave him alone.
WYATT:
--than how you write about it.
I wanna know how--
"You wanna take his place, midget?"
WYATT:
"I'm looking for the brutal, funny..."
-Yeah.
Sure.
-...maybe even the painful truth.
WYATT:
"Okay, everybody, if you have any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
Good luck.

She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"

"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.

You'll attack us?

Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
What are you...?
Nothing.
Oh
"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."
You don't have to make stuff up...
- Can't we just keep things the way they are...?
- Yeah.. sure...
Well...
Do you... have to... do anything special?
when you go steady...?
No.
-So everything's the same?
- Yeah...
Okay.
- We can go steady.

Yes.

"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.

Yes.
And I'm glad you are.

You still look pretty handsome to me.

"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.

Goodbye.

Doctor Tarras?
I'm a patient.
Máximo Gascón.
"Yes, please."
"It won't take long, just a minute."
Doctor Tarras?
I don't know if you remember some days ago you put me a tooth cap.
And... it's moving.
I'm sorry.
Didn't know it was that late.
"Alright, at the clinic."
I'm sorry for waking you up.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Federico?
It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
"Oh, Rache ..."
Why did I bother?
That does not bother to.
"We both miss him, John."
- I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
- Okay.
OK.
"- Hey, thanks for your looking for."
- No problem.
I never listened to?
Newer attırdım their signature.
Will be very famous.
This is a great Rook ...
Many are not my favorite kind.
You will understand what the hell is?
Shall I wear something on me.
Then they go to Sam to figure out.
"Tell your father, the latter one."
"After that, the file will not be another, right?"
"Losing it, Rook."
What do you mean?
Do not count on this halledebileceğime?
Jade told me to do.
That's it.

- Seems to be crying.
"Yes, I know."

"Are you all right, Sharon?"
"Are you all right, Sharon?"
- Now?
- Yeah.
"Aw, God almighty."
"Jesus, Sharon."
"You'll soon be the same shape as me, what?"
Thanks very much.
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
He's coming!
He's coming!
If you received my letter
We should have met him at the airport.
Not at all.
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If
You still want me
"Well, tie a yellow ribbon"

It's been three long years
Do you still want me?
Still want me

"Craig, love."
Sharon's having a baby.
Is that right?
"That's right, yeah."
Have a nice life.
Françoise.
Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
Don't hurt my daughter!
Let her go!
Deepa!
"Had you given the money, you would've saved a life."
"Trying to be a hero, are you?"
Go to hell!
"You moron, I'll kill you!"
If you even think of going to the police...
You will be inviting trouble for yourself.
Deepa.
Varun...
Varun...
Stop.
What happened?
Where were you?
What happened?
Every last piece of gold jewellery bought for the wedding is missing!
I called you N number of times.
Aunt told that you left the house this morning with a bag.
All the jewels are missing.
And you turn up like this now!
What happened?
Mom...
Deepa...
- Her again?
Why bring her up again?
What happened?
Deepa's dad met me yesterday.
He said Deepa was kidnapped and asked for my help.
So...
"So, I took the jewels to save her."
But everything went wrong.
Someone has entered valid launch codes.
Captain on deck!
What the hell is going on?
All 24 of our nuclear missiles went live.
This can't be right.
"Sir, we have nuclear missiles spinning up on the Albuquerque."
"If our allies see us launching a full scale nuclear strike, they will respond."
Russia and China will launch.
We'll have World War Ill..
unless you level the White House.
Four minutes to target!
I need a final gonna go for payload delivery.
God forgive me.
Go.
Go!
"Raptor Alpha 1, Operation Free Castle.."

Copy that.
Dropping to attack altitude.

"If he does, it'll start World War III."

"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
[Laughs]
[Gasps]
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
"I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed."
"But, Dad, I..."
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
"Ariel, you know that!"
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
"Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling..."
"Daddy, I love him!"
[gasps]
No!
Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human.
You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
"So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you."
"And if this is the only way, so be it!"
Daddy!
No!
No!
Please!
"Daddy, stop!"
"-We have to evolve, Bill."
Progressing ...
"Out of nowhere, took millions years to get here."
"Watch and learn, little brother!"
I will use natural selection.
"No, no, no."
The taste is very aromatic.
"You bit his ass, do not let go his head."
Instead I'll climb on his head.
-It is now!
"Forward-up, my friend."
"New delights, await us."
"Penguin, are you?"
Penguin.
Bravely go where was never a krill.
"We become legend, Bill."
That something important!
How much longer?
It's close.
"Hey, you idiot!"
Are you the licks kelp!
I guess I was wrong I thought you were ... a cruel machine to kill.
Want to try a penguin?
"Back, Bill."
The animal will pick up!
He's a warrior!
"But soon, he will fall, he is seeing death in the face."
"Good morning, handsome."
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.
-Boys.
-Father worked.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise your arms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise your arms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we never forget to smile.
A big round of applause.
Are you taking care of yourself?
Are you eating properly?
"Yeah, yeah."
I don't believe you.
Your voice tells me otherwise.
"Oh, stop!"
You're not my mother.
I am also not your girlfriend anymore.
But I am your agent.
This is about ourclients and a lost photojournalist.
Oursoldier is the greatest...
He's the bravest!
What the fuck is your hurry?
Sweetie you're digging yourself into deepershit.
The cops will find you here.
"What's up, girl?"
Are you bringing yourboys here now?
You disappeared again.
"Why, did we have a fuck date?"
Fuck you.
I won't have to weara uniform anymore.
How did you get out of it?
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.
She's also dating an astronaut.
Wow.
That's very impressive.
Yeah.
"But Leonard's impressive, too."
Thank you.
"""Befuddled."""
"The word I was looking for was ""befuddled."""
Knight to old woman... six-and-a-third.
Brilliant move.
Thank you.
Will the two of you excuse me?
I need a hug.
"Sorry, I have company."
"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
I don't want to hug you.
"I don't want to hug you, either."
I was just feeling blue.
"Blue, as in depressed."
"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
I don't know what color lonely is.
- What?
- Red is angry;
yellow is frightened;
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.
All right.
They'll be coming up soon.
"So just slow down a little, Dale."
"I'm pumped, man."
Pumped!
Stupid cops.
- Stupid!
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.
- You see him yet?
"- No, not yet."
"- When you see him, tell me quick!"
- I will!
- Now...
- Yeah?
"When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, Dale."
- That'll stop him.
- I'm a road warrior!
"- I know you are, Dale."
- I am.
"Time to stop those yuppie punks, Dale!"
"- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?"
"- You know we are, dude."
- That's hot.
- You know we are.
Did either of you ever actually kill anybody?
Not yet.
I did.
How did it feel?
It didn't feel like I thought it would.
It felt shitty.
It felt wrong.
But what can you do?
"Partner, there's nothing you could do."
Done.
What?
Let me do that.
Allright
You're helping out here?
No gentlemen around?
"No, there aren't any."
"Well then, another beer."
Cheers!
Who is Cilly sitting with?
Maybe some truckdriver.
She's into that type.
That's Biberkopf.
I've known him for a while.
Just released from prison. 4 years.
Why?
"Ida, his wife."
He killed her during a binge.
Not too bad.
"Done eating and drinking, she wanders off."
What's he doing here?
Do I owe you something?
You'd better not bother me.
You were in Tegel!
"- Yes, but that's over."
- You're a tough guy.
I'll start my own business:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders"
You're not gonna earn anything with that.
The main thing is that one lives his life decently.
Isn't that right or am i correct?
- What's your name?
Turn over the money I only took in this much all day!
How can I?
So what!
?
"Come on, come on"
Turn over the money
Bring it here!
"I've paid the fee everyday, Master"
But business was bad today
Please be patient!
Don't think you can put it off!
Stop!
You bastards
You drink the people's blood!
Let's see how fast you can kill me!
Beat him!
You bully as too much!
"Well, go teach them a lesson!"
Okay!
Use this
Okay
What are you doing?
Let us borrow this for a minute!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go after you've paid the fees!
Fees?
What fees?
I don't have any money!
"I have a life, though!"
That's enough!
I'll see how hard your bones are!
See.
He's back to save his brother.
A little longer and... his brother would've been crippled like his father.
Speak up.
What's your answer?
He abused you father.
Satyakant.
Better teach your son... before teaching Dharam kunj.
Start teaching about right and wrong at home.
Look.
Look how cruelly he's been beaten up.
Only a thug or goon can beat someone like this.
You seem to know a lot about goons.
What do you want to say?
Am I a goon?
Your son's action justifies that.
Surya!
Forth first time...
I hit someone.
That too my son.
You will never hit anyone again.
I... apologise...
On behalf of my son.
Let's go!
This boy has humiliated Satyakant's honor.
I'll handle him.
Satyakant!
Satyakant!
Brother.
Shiv.
He abused father.
I can endure anything in life.
There's no one there.
We can watch hockey.
Doesn't matter
--I am leaving you all --Where to?
Where to?
To take Sorokin's place?
Just my own
Where once was a feast There now stands a coffin...
What?
"--An aimless coffin --Sorry, which coffin?"
No.
"Hold it, Bobylev!"
Anyutin Lane!
I can't pay them all back.
But I will return one small debt.
Stop.
Make a left
--There's a ditch there.
Take pity on the vehicle.
"--I said, go left!"
"Faster, faster."
Why are you crawling?
--Now what?
--A puddle.
Need to check its depth.
Give me the steering wheel!
Step on it.
We'll cross it by accelerating
"I tell you like an ex-tank driver, step on it hard."
There we are.
I didn't get a chance to buy insurance on it.
"Oh, Bobylev."
Sorry.
Change of plans.
We'll take it from here.
[âª]
(syd:) thanks.
Got a knife?
His contact probably has the key to that.
"(andreas:) no, I do."
[âª] [sirens]
I don't think anyone followed us.
What's the combination?
0-5-0.
All the numbers left to right.
"Once we get this thing open,"
I have a few questions for you.
Like where you get your information.
Oh my god.

"(syd:)you're the answer man, watson."
I don't know.
You don't know?
This wasn't in my information.
Did you dial the numbers correctly?
Yes.
I don't suppose you have the number
For a bomb disposal unit?
Alright.
We can't just leave the map here.
A man who worked for
My father's construction company
Showed me how to do this once.
Defuse a bomb?
Are you a consultant?

"Damn, it's just a game."
I know it will be a challenge.
"Let's play another round, maybe we dive."
Well as a good gift.
We've paid to play.
I wonder where they find it.
Photography is my profile.
I'm here to win the game.
Let us drink.
"They found something to do, right?"

Damn.

"At least, we will help him to throw it."
What goes.
It is the love.
Sandokan.
Tiger of Malaysia.
"make case, wake up."
What happens?
I go to take a sample of urine for the analyses.
They have already taken it this morning.
"-New analyses, ""Wasserman""."
-Wasserman?
"Yes, they are things that happen if it is not had well-taken care of."
And if we made a cocktail?
"Yes, therefore we will give him a lesson."
To prepare.
-Benito!
-God.?
Who is?
"To your age, still beams those things?"
"Good, in fact..."
General extraction of urine.
To prepare.
It advanced.
Sr. Santarelli.
-What happens?
-What are you doing?
You do not have to get tired.
Go to the bed.
What has happened?
You got it?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Slowly.
Everything like I told you.
"Get out, and open my door, now."
Out.
"Andy, he's inside."
We ain't letting you out of here till you give us something.
"Hey, Paul."
What you got?
"Vagrancy and, uh, resisting arrest."
That's not a good way to start the day.
Come on.
Do I get my phone call?
What's going on?
Vernon.
"That domestic you rolled last week, the one with the broken collarbone?"
- What about him?
- Ia is all over it.
They want a statement from you on tape.
After we process this guy.
Bates can take care of it.
"I want this cleared up now, in my office."
Let's go.
Are you deaf?
Come on.
You watch yourselves with this one.
Process him then get back here.
"Okay, feeding in the loops."
Move.
Open it.
[Bubbling]
Smells like chemicals.
Crystal meth!
Masks on!
"Really, Leonard, with the kids up there?"
Ah.
"Okay, everyone, listen up."
Everyone on scene will have a baseline drug test.
Today.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Uh-huh.
"Hey, chief, Dawson and I didn't go down there."
I don't care.
Anybody on the premises.
We're gonna want to know how much any of you may have in your system.
Okay.
[Indistinct radio chatter]
Hey.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Seen you around a few times.
I live around the corner.
I like to watch.
Yeah.
I remember you saying.
"Well, you're welcome to come down to firehouse 51 anytime you'd like a tour."
Can I ride on the truck?
Maybe.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I may have taken something this morning.
Toradol?
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Send backup.
- All units respond.
Hold it steady.
My God!
"Yep, it's definitely a rug!"
"Way to go, Hardy, you asshole!"
"Tommy, congratulations."
We're all very proud of you.
You blew up a litter bug's car and found a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.
Let's just say that it was the killer and it was a cop.
It'd be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns.
He'd just be waiting for us to come along.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- Hardy...
- Yes.
- You should know something...
- Are you really a man?
- No.
- Good.
But I was married to one.
- A cop?
- Worse.
A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter.
She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
Hello.
-Hi.
Dude!
Thomas!
How's he doing?
Not so bad.
"There cerebral hematoma, but should to withdraw."
-Will there be consequences?
I had no idea.
I'm not a doctor.
They closed squat.
I know.
"If you want, come in Montrouge."
There are places.
Thank you.
"Here we are, do not worry."
We will avenge you.
Is Pierre here?
"I know 's early, but I see it."
Pierre does not work here.
Yeah?
I'll give you his new address.
I guess he not sit with what detention.
We all have our limits.
"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
But I beat them black and blue.
My name's inspector Zoravar Singh.
I can make arose stink.
Give a swine swine-flu.
And give lice to a bald head.
Listen.
You can't even lie properly.
- Shiv the truth is...
- Kamini!
He's no brave officer.
Kamini!
- He's a coward cop.
- Kamini.
- What?
- Kamini.
Kamini.
Calm down.
He's been beaten up by the local thugs.
You're not worthy of being my husband.
I say you're not worthy of this uniform either.
Inspector!
What did she hurl at me witch.
Nephew.
It's like this.
I'm actually a sub-inspector.
I couldn't become an inspector.
You see.
I had been appointed for the security... of that crazy ACP Ayushman Thakur's sister.
Now how do I go with this broken hand?
You don't get it.
See.
What are you doing?
Did you make the pudding?
Depends.
On what?
Whether you liked it or not.
[ Grunts ] What's in it?
"Relax, Jack Lalanne."
It's low-cal.
"Nonfat milk, sea salt --"
"No, no."
Not the ingredients.
The something extra.
"Chill, man."
"Supplements, okay?"
Dean:
What kind of supplements?
Sam:
Here.
Hey.
"[ Exhales deeply ] To boost metabolism, per Larry and Maritza."
"These aren't ""supplements"", they're roofies."
What?
How do you know what roofies look like?
How do you not know?
You think I want to end up in a hotel bathtub with my kidney carved out?
In Chechnya?
[ Sighs ]
[ Groans ] Did you find anything out in the yoga?
Yeah.
"Yeah. ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."""
Every single person in class had one of those freaky-ass suction marks.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Donna:
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.
- Who?
- The watchman.
- What's his name?
- Antonio.
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?
I said stop!
Sit down.
Do you know who Carmen and Estrella were?
"Before they killed them, they tortured them."
With a hunting knife and pliers.
They ripped off their nipples.
They cut off their toes.
They stuck something in their ass and vagina until they bled.
They were awake the whole time.
You can't imagine how much pain a person can bear before fainting.
I didn't know.
"I didn't know, I didn't know..."
Look at me.
What's the watchman's name?
Sebastian.
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?
I don't know.
He had changed a lot.
I hardly recognized him.
- Shooting.
Wait!
Wait.
She's pregnant.
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140.
Baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
"It's my arm, man."
It hurts like a...
Do something already!
BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
"Ricky, you need to calm down."
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
"Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis."
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
"So, what?"
Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
"- An eye for an eye, man."
- Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
Oh...
Out of time.
You found two answers...
And what you are looking for was transformer.
"This is the stuff you know, guys, isn't it?"
"Difficult to find in the hive, though."
Not particularly.
Not that kind of physics.
Not electronics.
"Well, not bad then, in that case."
"You got two points, well done."
"Team Araucarians, over to you."
Which topic would you like?
We have left...
We're good on...
"Music's not good for any of us, is it?"
No.
"Well, maybe me."
I work in technology.
"Technology, yeah."
Go for it.
Technology.
You've chosen technology.
You're looking for typefaces.
You've ten seconds to confer.
Typefaces?
"Helvetica, Comic Sans, Garamond, Arial, Times New Roman..."
Helvetica - we've had that.
Yeah.
Courier...
Time's up.
"Simon, at the far end, we're going to start with you."
Maybe later.
"What do we got, McGee?"
"How about you, Agent Gibbs?"
When was the last time you made a good snow angel?
'Cause it's... it's snowing.
McGee.
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.
They pick up chatter all the time.
Subject is northeast U.S. airports.
"Attention, passengers-- due to extreme weather conditions..."
Oop.
Sorry.
Uh...
"Oh, hey."
You again.
"Look, about before, uh, my husband has quite the chivalrous streak."
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, now that I've run into you again... do we know each other?"
I feel like we've met before.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Has that ever happened to you?
"You see a face, you just can't place it?"
"Not really, no."
Oh.
"Delays are a drag, huh?"
Where you headed?
Home to see family?
Paris.
Business.
"Ah, Paris."
"She's been hiding something very important from you, you know."
Her family was murdered by a Methuselah.
Her family... was murdered?
Ah.
"I guess you really didn't know, tovaras."
That... can't be...
How odd that she never told you about something so important...
"Who knows, maybe she harbors a grudge against you, too."
Or perhaps-
He got away!
Your Lordship!
Are you all right?
!
Watch Esther!
She's in the backroom of the building on that hill!
Understood!
"Are you all right, Count?"
You've been seriously wounded...
This is nothing at all.
It will quickly heal.
But how did you find me?
An odd message was thrown my way as I returned from the palace.
Thrown?
By whom?
No idea.
What's wrong?
They... and Radu...
plan to kill Her Majesty!
What?
!
Esther-san!
Esther-san!
Timetable updated.
-Mmm-hmm.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
is there a problem?
-No.
"-Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
"Ugh, this drilling is driving me nuts."
I wanna find David and Meredith.
(tapping THE GUN)
You sure no one else could be in here?
-What?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
-Think they got what they came for?
-Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
katherine:
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
No work here.
MAIRIE OFFICER:
"Valjean, as a dangerous man, you will be on parole forever."
Failure to report means immediate arrest.
Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.
Follow him.
(EXCLAIMS IN ANNOYANCE)
(YELLING)
INNKEEPER:
Let me see your papers.
Monsieur?
Papers.
I'll sleep in the stable.
"Please, I'm hungry."
Get out.
(GROANS)
(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Hey!
"(SINGING) Come in, sir, for you are weary"
And the night is cold out here
Though our lives are very humble
What we have We have to share
There is wine here to revive you
There is bread to make you strong
There's a bed to rest till morning
Rest from pain And rest from wrong
Bless the food we eat today.
Bless our dear sister and our honored guest.
(SIGHS)
(CLATTERING)
Get in there!
Put him down!
Make him flee?
Mr. Thakur wants to become the CP.
Tomorrow if people find out that... one of his inmates has escaped... then you can flush his chances of a promotion... down the drain.
Good.
What's on your mind?
Clear all the charges against Shiv... and set him free.
Once his connection's severed from you...
I'll cut his connection with life permanently.
Wow!
What an idea!
Great.
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.
Fine.
I'll give Shiv clean chit and release him.
Good.
But don't mess up the contract.
He won't.
How can he?
When he kills Shiv I'll be with him.
Right Boss.
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Get out.
Go on.
Let's go.
Who are you?
Boss.
Dad our player's entered the field.
Yes.
Wow!
What do you think?
Excellent!
You're very much appreciated.
You are flattering me.
Of course not!
Look.
"The blind is being touched by you, he is crying."
"Your Honour, if there isn't anything special, I request a rest."
For I have an eye problem.
You see pus from my eyes?
"Jury, have you reached any verdict?"
Yes.
Unanimous?
Yes.
The jury has pleaded the accused guilty.
"As stipulated,"
the accused should be hanged.
Court.
Wait.
Thank you for taking care of me.
This chicken leg is for you.
Sir.
"You kill me, but many many Ho Foons will appear."
Sir.
Wait.
"Your Honour, what punishment Ho Foon should receive?"
He is stipulated to be hanged.
It's alright.
Yan.
Let him down.
What do you want?
You just ordered to hang him.
- [ Grunts ]
"Help, Smithers."
I'm sinking.
I'm sinking.
[ Gasps ]
Life... flashing... before-- [ Gurgling ] eyes.
You're fired!
Dance!
[ Laughing ]
[ Grunting ]
Dance!
[ Horn Blows ]
All right.
We're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste.
"Oh, no!"
Our boat is sinking.
"It was I, you fools!"
The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all. [ Grunts ]
"And all this time, I've been smoking harmless tobacco."
"[ Chortles, Grunts ]"
[ Evil Laughter]
"I got a mink chamois, sir."
I hope that-- [ Gasps ]
"Oh, my God!"
Mr. Burns is dead!
[ Sobbing ] Why do the good always die so young?
[ Wailing ]
[ Gasps ] You almost killed me!
"- [ Grunts ] - [ Gasps ] Please, sir."
You'll catch-- [ Gags ] cold.
"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died... there would be no one to carry on my legacy?"
Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm...
- I have the rights to adoption.
- Never!
Thanks for freeing me.
I had no means... to get out.
Carry your papers... and no one will hassle you.
I didn't know that.
"It won't happen again, brother."
Have you finished?
- Have some more.
- I'm full.
You can always eat a little more.
- Have a roll.
"- I can't, really."
Try the salad.
Don't refuse everything.
Have some fruit.
I'll have a banana.
- I'm leaving now.
- Already?
"Wait for me, I'll wash my hands."
"As I foresaw, your employment has been arranged."
Come to the factory tomorrow.
There's no need for a ride.
- How will you go back?
"- On foot, as usual."
- I'll show you out.
- Don't bother.
Good evening!
Balla!
They set you free?
My boss paid for me.
Liar!
Everyone report to the parachute issuing room in half an hour!
Sirl
What's that?
Oh.
One of the girls wrote it.
"""..."
Let no parachute sidle or slump...
"""For today we go warring together,"
"""And my soul..."
"""...will be there at the jump."""
It's rather good?
"I wouldn't know, poetry is not in my line."
Why do you always have?
Stop talking there!
Right.
"Out on the tarmac, you men."
Move yourselves.
Let's begin.
Deck 'shun!
Quick march!
"Company, halt!"
"All right, fall out."
I'm sorry for the man who hears the pipes and who isn't born in Scotland.
Standby to enplane.
Enplane.
"Climb aboard, boys."
Good luck to you.
I'll see you back at the camp in the morning.
"I hope so, Sir."
"Listen, everybody."
This is Flight Sergeant Box.
He's our radar dismantling expert.
"Shut, fucking you, right!"
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
"Congratulations, dude."
6 months.
And I am to start in September.
And...?
"The fucking practice,"
"All do I ... shippings, all the high power plants,..."
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!
"Look, look, look!"
"You're right, I shall discuss with them."
"What's up, guys!"
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
"What's up, bro?"
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
"How about a drop of the white stuff, tickle soft?"
"Paul first, doen't he?"
I should not...
"- Almost for Paul, man."
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you...
"Actually, all of you..."
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Actually, I came here to talk to you."
Me?
-Busy after school?
-Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And bring your flower.
We can't be in detention together.
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
-I'm gonna kill him.
"-No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"- Sarge, I have to pee now too."
- Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
- I have to pee really badly.
- Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge--
"- Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
- Did you get breakfast?
"- I tried, but I got recognized."
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"- Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
- Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
- I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
- I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
SvenPense!
"He saw his eyes, all terrified."
You said he was.
I chose to save that poor life.
What?
"-He will tell their friends, spread terror."
There's a new predator in the area.
-You're crazy!
-Someone needs to control the number of individuals of species.
-I deserve.
Wearethechampions My friends
And we'll keep fighting until the end
If -sees!
-I am the champion!
-Am champion!
It's a musical delight.
Will is the first sign of madness.
We champion
-How is the shoulder?
-Okay.
Boot a little ice it improves.
Thank you.
"No, I thank you."
"Thank you, friend."
"Brian, the king of the beach, will have another season."
That made you a friend of elephant seals.
"As we speak, children?"
"Thank you, buddy to bring Daddy back."
"-I owe you, my friend."
"-Health, Brian."
"No, I mean it."
You only need to ask.
It beat colouring books.
"Don't worry, she has a fabulous memory"
For things she did as a child.
"Actually, he taught me how to"
"Wire a charge, never defuse it."
"But it should work the same in reverse,"
Don't you think?
"Okay, step back."
There's enough c4 in there
To blow the roof of the building off.
"Okay, you've got to isolate your wires."
"Blue, red, yellow,"
White and black.
Black's your power source.
"Of course, it could also be red."
(nigel:)it's blue.
"In every action movie,"
The hero always cuts the blue wire.
You want to risk our lives
On information you got from the movies?
20 seconds...
19...
"White's always the ground,"
So...
"Red is your backup battery, right."
But I only see one battery.
"12 seconds, syd."
Must be black.
(nigel:) ah... (syd:) black.
Ah...
Red.
Ah!
Little?
Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!
November.
"Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you."
Hey.
I'm Barry.
Sam.
...of your most memorable family experience.
A reminder though.
This is gonna be worth half of your final grade.
Leave him alone.
I'm going for a record.
"I said, ""leave him alone."""
You want to take his place midget?
Yeah.
Sure.
"Ok, everybody, got any questions?"
"All right, let's get started."
"Today, you will have the honor of playing one of the greatest games ever invented."
"A game of skill, agility, cunning."
A game with one simple rule.
Dodge.
Sorry.
"Uh, substitute coach Roth."
Yes?
Ms. Boudreaux never let us play dodge ball.
"Well, Ms. B's in Massachusetts getting married, so we're playing."
She says it's dangerous.
Take a lap!
But...
Go nuts.
Having fun?
The whistle makes me their god.
Right.
Nice shorts.
Whoa!
"Hey, there's no one driving that thing!"
Ho!
Someone stop it!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Easy.
"Easy, boy."
You boys lose something?
- That was scary.
- Officer!
Good.
I've never seen such a thing.
Shouldn't we bring those boys in or something?
"Trust me, whatever punishment we give them, it's nothing compared to what's waiting for them at home."
"Those boys know if anything was to happen to that horse, if it got injured, the whole family would lose its ability to plow the field, make food for the winter."
So that's it?
"They're just gonna feel really, really guilty?"
It works.
Believe me.
It won't happen again.
"I guess growing up here, you know all this stuff."
You have no idea.
Where are we?
"Ohio, somewhere."
I miss Mommy.
I know.
Me too.
I thought I had improvised well.
"- That's right, sire."
Stop.
We repeat.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, it is best to avoid any comment."
Sorry.
His Majesty?
Very well.
"Yes, I'll be careful."
"I care for you, do not worry."
"I think so, yes."
"See you, His Majesty."
Mr. Lloyd?
The Queen told me to remember them
To film the speeches from start to finish and to grasp the smiles.
Do we do it again?
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
I remember that Turkey's handshakes are energetic.
Stop.
Perfect.
"Now we can go, sire."
"Mr. Lloyd, can follow us."
It's really tiny.
The Atomium?
"Yes, it's a fiasco."
No.
"Well, that too."
The space reserved for Mini-Europe.
It looks like an extension of Turkey instead of the opposite.
Now.
- Na.
I did not remember what I wanted unfortunately.
- Something is other entirely.
- Oh see!
This is the trouble!
The start is very plain though.
"It would be necessary to think of it only, how you did the boxes before me arriving here."
"Ágika cut the cardboards, I folded."
And kind Tót what did he do?
- I got some air.
- Oh see!
Oneagainst one!
"I cut the cardboards alone though now, you though three people you make the folding,"
three against one.
"He has time to look at butterflies at night, to doze and you let your thoughts ramble."
- And why?
- Why?
- Why?
- Ágika?
"I believe it, because the our margin-cutting small."
Bravo!
For your daughter is golden mind.
"Thank you, Ágika."
"Is child's play, the others already!"
"Right, kind Tót?"
Yees!
- Good night!
- Good night!
He kissed me.
"You saw it, mom?"
Daddy!
How many?
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.
"- Luka, let me take this."
"- It's okay, I got it."
"Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance."
"- Breathe for us, Trina."
- Tracheal shift.
Hold up.
Her lung is down.
"- Sats, only 88."
"- Miss, can you describe who did this?"
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.
- Want me to do it?
"- No, 18 gauge."
How many were there?
"You' re gonna get your ID as soon as she's stable, I promise."
She's not moving air.
No pulse.
Try the other side.
"- No, pull the dressing off."
- What?
"The dressing on the chest wound, pull it off."
"- Okay, pulse is stronger."
- Good chest excursions.
"All right, let's get her inside."
Luka?
Just need a minute.
"Dr. Lewis, patron saint of lost causes."
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.
Come!
Mada mada da ne.
That'll be all.
Good afternoon!
Captain...
"Playing a match without approval, twenty rounds around the court."
But I-
Forty rounds.
Yes.
The rest of you start your high-intensity training.
The first years pick the balls.
Yes.
You're the team captain.
Please give me your guidance.
I will join next semester.
"First, hand up a registration form."
"Ah, okay."
Oyaji.
"Oh, Ryoma."
"Gave me a scare there, what're you doing here?"
Is your mother doing fine?
It's outrageous.
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?
It's called Seishun Gakuen.
Nothing spectacular.
"Why, don't like it?"
"Don't tell me that to get me into that school, you brought me here all the way from the States?"
"Well, you can say that."
How about it?
Let's have a game.
Here then.
I'll crush you.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
Black.
Damn it!
What do you want?
"You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed."
Gunzel was no serial killer.
Not in the usual sense.
He was filling orders.
And not just for Hiromitsu.
Orders?
From whom?
Someone called lrezumi.
There are collectors...
Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
There are others...
- Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison.
He couldn't have committed every murder.
If it was murder!
All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing.
Come on.12
Has Gunzel's death been made public?
Tomorrow.
- We have to stop it.
Until we knowwho's behind it.
We?
"- Yeah, I wanna work the case again."
What's the lawyer's name?
Schoubya.
Frank Schoubya.
"Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again."
I'll clear things with my superiors.
I got him!
"Catherine, oh, I've always loved that name."
"- Beautiful day, huh?"
- Sure is.
"- Thank you, Catherine."
- Thank you.
Have a nice day.
[Sighs]
Man: [On TV] Finding the right chair is hard.
- [Applause]
- Man:
Incredible inven...
Man:
You can get your dream kitchen for...
Man:
"To the DCPA's credit, this thing hasn't happened at all before."
"In fact, this is a rarity, and so they apologize to all those folks."
- Those folks...
- 44 will be the coolest that we've had.
- You have to go back to August...
- [Snoring]
- To the north and west...
- [Tablet chiming]
"Back out toward the northwest plateau,"
"Craig Beeker, that is a freeze warning."
"- Basically, if you had..."
"- Oh, shit."
[Phone rings]
I'm sure the check is in the mail.
Hello.
"Can you hold on a second, please."
"Hey, Ellen."
It's the joy of teaching which is the reward.
Miss.
Are you scared of going with me?
No.
"I'd like to see for myself, what you're going to offer him."
You're insane!
"Why, you as well?"
!
Who are you?
"Tell your leader,"
I'm So Seo-No from Yeon Ta-Bal's clan.
I want to see the bandit leader.
"Came by yourself, didn't you?"
You really are something.
"The Commander isn't here now,"
"Until he comes back, throw this girl into the cell."
Yes.
Miss!
Miss!
What's going on?
Is the entire fleet captured?
"Not that,"
Miss decided to come on her own accord.
What?
Are you crazy?
How can you deliver yourself to him?
A blessing to see you're doing well.
"Seriously,"
Did you really come here yourself?
Yes.
Now... what exactly were you thinking?
Are you hurt?
Miss!
How many Tiles belong?
112.
"You got it, sweetheart."
- Just tell me when.
- Fantastic!
You'll come for dinner before?
- I'll make a brisket.
- I love brisket.
Get home safe.
"Well, I'm taking a cab anyway."
Thanks again.
"Hello, Larry."
"- I got to see you, Frank."
"- Well, here I am."
How about a cup of coffee?
"No, thanks."
We got to talk.
Are you finished here?
"Well, the business of government is never finished."
"Come on, let's take a walk."
Mister A!
"How are you, Milton?"
I'm as corny as Kansas in August
I'm as normal as blueberry pie
No more a smart little girl With no heart
I have found me a wonderful guy
"Speaking of blueberry pies bring us a couple, Milton."
"You, à la mode?"
"No, thank you."
I don't want any pie.
Apple for him.
"And coffee, Milt."
Ha ha!
Captain Kirk.
"You must try harder, Captain."
This is too easy.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, can you hear me?"
"Touche, Captain."
Touche.
"I must confess you scored first, but after all, I never played this game before."
And now let's have at it again!
Ha ha ha!
Enterprise...
Enterprise...
Aha!
Tallyho!
Aha...
"You made a noble fight of it, Captain."
"Remember, you promised to let my ship go."
But this is such sport.
I must fetch all the others back to play.
So this is victory.
It has a sweet taste.
"Down, Captain-- on your knees!"
"You haven't won, Trelane."
I could run you through!
But you haven't won anything.
"On your knees, Captain!"
No!
Does it still taste as sweet?
I order you.
You've been beaten!
But I'm not defeated.
Good for the pain within.
Very good super aspirin.
My body feels light.
Soon you'll feel much better.
I think the Paki fancies the pusher frau.
Hossein is no Paki.
He's Persian.
"Well, then the Persian fancies the pusher frau."
"- Hi, Steso."
"- Maria, get dressed."
- It smells of... opium!
- Against pain.
Too expensive for you.
- Fucking Paki!
- Persian.
"Fucking Persian, then."
Asger?
How's my credit?
- Very bad...
- Right.
I'll just hang around then.
"We're all waiting for something bigger and better to hit us, right?"
I'm not waiting for anything.
"Will you let Asger tattoo your hardened, Middle Eastern body?"
Having tattoos is a sin.
Your body is a temple.
It's sacred.
"You don't tag your own temple, do you?"
"- And you, Steso."
You got any?
- Plenty.
Look!
Put the web cam in on.
I will watch it all.

Come.
All these are my childhood friends.
Hello.. hi.

"Do not search for logic, you will miss magic."
Happy wedding anniversary Tukaram sir.

Our Vasundhara madam has sent this gift for you.
Oh..
Thank you.
Take and keep this inside.
"Madam, this is your marriage day."
Can we see your marriage album?
That is..
Album got burnt in the fire accident.
"Buddy, let us start the party."
"- PK must come, right?"
"You mean PSPK, Is Pawan Kalyan coming for the party?"
[PSPK:
PowerStarPawanKalyan]
It is not PSPK who is coming.
"Just PK, my friend."
"Cooper, do not attempt to remove that yourself."
Removing it yourself is extremely dangerous.
"Stop that, that could kill you!"
Just stay calm!
Is that Shou?
Is that Shou?
What's he saying?
What's he saying?
"Okay, Cooper."
We're gonna commence with deactivation.
"Oh, that's great news."
We need you to follow instructions and make it to the access point.
The access point?
Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?
"- Oh, fuck!"
More stairs?
Come on!
- Just one more level.
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Left at the top.
"- Okay, which door?"
- Room at the end.
What is it?
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.
- Something like...
- Like what?
Some personal fucked-up shit.
Like...
"I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head."
It was he who arrested 10 years ago following a settling of drug-related.
That's him.
All 2 at the height of summer was messed 10 pairs godasses.
It must have cost money...
- Matsuda!
That's not the problem!
- But yes!
"This is not money, but their legs !"
We can do nothing without money !
It was an expensive summer.
"M. Yagami, you got it!"
Congratulations.
- In the interrogation room.
- Heard .
You too I buterai you.
You will see
"I'll have your skin too, you'll see"
- You heard.?
You'll see!
- Mr. Yagami .
The hospital contacted us
Your wife goes wrong dot
Let us do.
Go to her .
"No, Otoharada priority."
I will go to the hospital after .
Why are you not come immediately
"You've been called many times, why not come to you?"
Mom!
!
Mom
- Dad!
"Oh my God, you're serious!"
So where were we?
What am I wearing?
"Well, nothing, naturally."
Ha!
Ha!
Charles?
Hello?
Charles?
Charles!
Battery!
No!
[ Her screams echoes. ]
[ Amaar is banging his head on the table. ]
I can't believe you built a bomb.
I didn't build a bomb!
I merely collected a bunch of things that look like bomb-making things!
"It was not a crime, just suspicious and very costly."
"- Well, you proved your point."
"- I know, and it breaks my heart!"
"Then why'd you do it, Baber?"
Because I was happy with the way things are!
[ He starts whining. ]
OK!
"Baber, that's what this is about?"
"Look, nothing's going to change!"
The mosque will always be there for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
"By this time tomorrow,"
We'll be in solitary confinement together.
[ The door opens. ]
OK!
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
Now.
"Come on, up the rigging."
Get up!
Come on now!
"Up the rig, there."
Have they died up there?
Keep it moving!
Much better.
You've accomplished wonders with them.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Don't press them too hard.
Twelve minutes 45 seconds to beat.
They'll do it this time.
- Is he badly hurt?
"- Leg broken, sir."
Get him to the surgeon.
- That'll be enough drill for today.
"- Carry on, down below."
- Dismiss the starboard watch!
- Mr. Scott-Padget will you have dinner with me?
- Starboard watch secure.
"- Thank you, sir."
- What about the man injured today?
- Not too good.
I may have to take the leg off.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Scott-Padget asked if he can return to duty.
- You don't like him.
- I've served with him before.
- When?
- In the Beedle.
"Bad ship, that was."
[LAUGHING]
- So you still wanna have coffee?
- Absolutely.
"Oh, great."
"Okay, I really will stop gushing in a minute."
But when we walked out into that parking lot and I saw that you drive a Prius too...
[LAUGHS]
- I almost wept.
- I know.
I'm not alone anymore.
Oh!
"I didn't ask you, though."
"Are you married, or?"
Mm.
Divorced.
Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic!
My marriage was a miserable failure too.
No.
"No, actually we're still really good friends."
Yes.
I'm still really good friends with my ex-husband.
- You're kidding.
"- No, I am not."
- We are the exact same person.
- I know.
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever let your armpit hair grow out just to see how long it'll get?
Eww.
No.
Do you?
No.
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
Shut up!
Help!
...
Saw your bro's name card and I saw a deal.
The person who killed your bro has a tattoo.
It's a scorpion.
Take it.
Thought you've principles?
Why pay me?
For your medical bills.
Thanks Mr. Lin.
I'd waited for you whole night.
Our fight is not over.
You still want to fight?
I'm not in the mood.
Then I win.
Since I defeated you
I'll help with your bro's case.
I'm the best cop around.
Even when suspended?
"Suspended, not resigned."
I've the highest record for cases solved.
Widest network of informers.
I know.
Using money.
Can you not shoot me down?
I'll find the killer very soon.
How soon?
I give you 3 weeks.
I don't need 3 weeks.
"Once done, you go back home quickly."
To your place of origin.
She and Agesha would yo along well.
I'll talk to Ma
To Nitu
I would like to introduce you to my little brothers
This is Jai
That's Jagadish
"I tried to evade them, but they forced me to drink some rum"
"Friends, in our times... where will you find brothers who love so dearly?"
My brothers are like my limbs
Get out
Time to buy a bigger car.
This is the one that stays
Jagadish...
- Take care of that kid.
He's high
Playing big brother.
"Jagadish, you knock"
What's up?
"Tonight, we're happy!"
Reason being...
Jai has found a daughter-in-law for you
I even okayed her
But who is she?
She's a foreigner.
But she's Indian
"Say yes, Ma."
- Ma's over there
"Say yes, Ma"
Say yes
"Say yes, Ma..."
one minute!
Happy days!
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
-Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
-Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
(GRUNTS)
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
-Bite down.
-l think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
(breathing heavily)
(panting)
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)
(GASPS)
That was bizarre.
(sighs)
(EXHALES)
Emerson!
I'll force him to fight!
What do you mean?
"If you kill them, how can we tell which faction is superior?"
So you tricked us!
You filthy woman!
You induced me to avoid the archery.
You all go out!
"Sister, what are you doing?"
"Brother, you must not kill them now."
You go away!
"Brother, forget about it!"
Brother!
"Jun-kit, what strike is that?"
Please excuse me!
Come on!
Good strike!
You haven't learned this sword before.
He certainly hasn't!
"Fung-wu, I'll give it back."
You fight better than me!
Take the sword.
Just fight!
You haven't seen this Chin Kang Fist before.
"Brother, stop."
He's changing styles.
I'll see what else they've got!
How about my fist?
You want to learn?
"Brother, are you hurt?"
"It's alright, I haven't hurt him!"
Ridiculous.
Go!
AKAN:
"Memories, memories, memories."
My first batch of cyber soldiers.
"With everything that you have experienced today uploaded into what's left of their brains, all they remember is waking up in the lab with their wife screwing their legs on."
"I love you, Charlie."
"I love you, Edward."
"I love you, Thomas."
You recognize these?
No?
That's odd.
They're your wife's.
(SNIFFING)
Mmm...
I smell what you like about her.
(BEEPING)
This one is almost ready for you.
"But I'm warning you, their boosters make the one you have in you now..."
Look like a fucking 9-volt.
Go ahead and fuck him up.

Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
* You got the epic mother... *
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
* You got the epic mother... *
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
Stilinski!
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
No idea.
The murderer would be dead inside .
The police officer has not received the shot the killer allegedly shot because of pain .
We repeat
The murderer...
So...
It was a real...
Dad!
I'm fine.
Where is Light?
Party somewhere.
We can not count on him.
How it is possible...
I would have preferred to live .
without knowing such a thing
I killed
2 persons...
Me?
Sorry.
Papa.
You want to die?
I am the former owner of the Death Note .
I am the God of Ryuk death.
Do not be so surprised.
"From now on, you had to understand that it is not a simple notebook?"
How does it feel to kill?
Shit!
Papa.
Sayu.
Farewell.
You do not want this notebook ?
My presence does not mean that you will soon die.
Really?
That should be OK ln you get
What is it?
is something wrong?
Should I leave you alone?
Of course
- Gentlemen
- Sir
- Are you OK?
"- Yes, sir"
Here.
Two boys were caught in the cemetery searching a grave I'm dealing with it
Searching a grave?
Why did you do it?
It wasn't desecration was it?
What were you after?
It was Camille Séguret's grave
Did you know her?
Where is the body?
"When the watchman caught you, it was gone lt wasn't there"
- Where is it?
- We never touched it
Where is Camille Séguret?
What do you mean?
"She was buried there, wasn't she?"
So where is she now?
I think she's back
Back?
Back from where?
From the dead
It's hard to describe
"First, I saw a great light that dazzled me lt felt like I was going blind"
"Hey, asshole !"
Come!
Get it!
You created the wrong gangster!
I love the taste of black blood in the morning!
The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern.
I thought he was dead.
The turns of electronics.
We are approaching the death zone.
You're good?
Motherfucker!
"The electronics are fine, Commander."
"Well, Kix!"
What a sight you have so extreme.
I've never seen a noid with hair.
"Because they do not grow hair, asshole."
Mutated Humanoids.
True.
- This is a Sammy 69-7-H.
- A Sammy 69-7-H?
"This is an old model of pleasure, is not it?"
"They probably lost their virginity, did not they, Hatta?"
- Are you cold?
- No sir.
Pack it in the tank!
Can you walk on that leg?
Yes.
"You're going to make it, brother."
Ice teaches all humility.
It shows us our limits.
Our weaknesses.
Our humanity.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"On deck, Mr. Pardoe!"
Mr. Crawford!
Mr. Crawford!
- Find the senior midshipman for me.
"- Mr. Kilpatrick, sir?"
- Tell him to see me in the gunroom.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get that hatch open.
Let some air into the magazine.
Did you hear what I said?
Open that hatch.
"But we had it open yesterday, sir."
I don't care if it was.
I'm giving you an order.
Open that hatch!
- Orders is weekly.
"- Stand, you insolent dog!"
Mr. Kilpatrick?
Mr. Scott-Padget wants to see you.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
He said now.
- Get that hatch open at once.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Carry on, Sergeant Kneebone."
- Three more.
- I've got seven.
- Only five.
- Good enough.
"Only a few more, and we'll have the whole ship."
"- Now, we write our petition."
What happened?
I yawned.
Will be best if I am packing and i'm on my way.
"I think, I was not the wrong one."
"I asked it, you are not sleepy."
"But, he not sleepy, respectable major lord."
Why did he yawn then?
Why you yawned my Lajos?
I don't know.
Only some.
Only some?
Did you yawn because you feel well possibly?
"Yes, major lord."
"Here you go to believe, major lord."
That's right.
"Please make a statement, dear Tót."
What would you do now the with pleasure?
- May I be honest?
- Of course.
Well...
I now the with pleasure...
I would make a box a little.
Yes?
"- And you, Mariska?"
- I too.
- Ágika?
"- I too, of course"
If you insist on him this much...
I do not regret it.
"I ask you for it only, let this not occur repeatedly."
No.
Never again.
Cross over those territories in such an unstable period
Is definitely out of the question.
Why never?
Because they are the Balkans.
So?
I said the Balkans.
- Yes and then?
Unstable.
Unstable.
"There is Bulgaria, Serbia..."
"Romania, Albania, Macedonia..."
Excuse me.
- His Majesty.
Excuse me.
We'll have a meeting.
We will return.
- All right.
She must understand...
- Sire.
Wait a moment.
We have to find a solution.
"It is not possible, Your Majesty."
"Sorry, I have to go."
"Mr Lloyd, not now."
I try to speak with Turkish security and Mr. Bulut.
Maybe even with the ambassador.
I'm going to take the luggage.
"Sire, I see if there's a field above."
Excuse me.
Where is the Ambassador?
"One time, I documented wars and revolutions."
"Then I drank for a decade, persecuted by nightmares."
-Swimming?
Can not know what we become.
"Beauty, eat plankton the rest of your life."
"But that's what we are, are herbivores."
-We are vegetarians.
What?
For everyone devour us.
I am no longer so to be on the menu.
-Where you going?
-Go up the food chain.
Food chain?
"I chew something that has ""Face."""
I do not remember that.
It always seems that everything different in the back.
So I think we should go the other way.
The land of emperors is opposite.
Why not go there.
"No, no, this is better."
-But shortcuts are shorter.
Not always.
"What is, is not that far."
"Guys, stop."
"Erik, I had to stop."
Okay.
Okay.
"Continue, but pay attention and go slowly."
"It is best not to look down, okay."
"Atticus, what I said."
"Good day, a champion!"
Where to go?
In-house.
-It is.
It was only for a month because the competition was in May
And in June Montenegro declared itself independent.
"Since they are from Montenegro, they gave the title to a Serb."
Bitch.
I remember this story.
In Belgrade they got stubborn and they gave me this job.
"It's not a happy ending, right?"
"I'm sure, Mr. Duncan Lloyd,"
This is a very interesting job.
Serbia enjoys dancing.
"- Thank you, I'll do it."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"Incredible, I really recognized it."
The Finns.
The capital of the Falklands?
- Stanley.
The first country to adopt Christianity?
Armenia.
The first atheist state?
I have no idea.
- Albania.
Does he make you happy?
Does the camera make you feel right to dig in the lives of others?
It depends.
And what noble purpose?
The search for beauty...
And the truth.
"Okay, give it to me."
- Thing?
The camcorder.
Me dia.
"She looked at me, but didn't see me."
"- But, tonight..."
- Tonight?
"Hey, I buy her!"
- What's going on?
- What do you think?
"Passports, tickets, cha cha cha!"
Duvigny.
Defarge.
Theron.
Fuselli.
Salesman.
Ten foggy days in Budapest?
"I just started my shift, detective."
We're just chatting with a friend from Budapest.
"We're in first class, coach 15."
Hungarian.
Thank you.
Can you show me your luggage?
"of course, enthusiastically sir!"
To be enthusiastic means to be inhabited by God!
Brilliant.
Hey...
"If cops freak you out, how will you ever make it with women?"
Brothers with different names...
and I'm not a friend from Buda.
"Hey, Dumbo!"
Look!
Isn't it grand?
"You will meet her, you will see her, but you will never believe what you see!"
Isn't Paris more rich than your Buda-shit?
- Nobody picking you up?
That looks like an industrial park.
"Well, it was, but now it's slated for demolition."
I'll call Booth.
(glass breaks)
BOOTH:
Looks like this is where he set up shop.
Look at all this stuff.
Booth?
Yeah?
Look at this.
There's parish records.
News clippings about Aldo.
Discharge documents...
This X-ray is not Aldo's.
It's of somebody else.
How do you know?
There's a stellate-shaped wound directly above the right squamosal suture.
Gunshot?
Yes.
The extent of the damage indicates a high powered rifle.
Perfectly placed.
Not too many people can make that shot.
BRENNAN:
The writing is Cyrillic.
Serbian.
That is correct.
Where are you going?
Over here.
Going behind door number two.
Look at this.
This is not good.
(clears throat)
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
Take look.
This uniform transforms a common man into a hero.
- I see.
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy...
- into a macho-man.
- Idea.
What?
Idea.
Only you can save me from suspension now.
- What?
- You take my place.
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.
- Zoravar can...
- Hold on uncle.
This is impossible I cannot do it.
Why do you think the ACP chose me?
Because he knows it's just a formality.
And I assure you... she will believe you're Zoravar.
Because she has never seen me.
It's headfirst to Delhi.
It's just fo rthree days.
Here's her photograph.
What's the problem?
- Ankita!
- Yes she's...
You know her?
Yes I know her very well.
We met last year during the Jaipur lnter-college festival.
Her voice.
Her eyes.
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different.
Oi!
They're going down the science block.
Come back!
Halls of residence.
Shall we?
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
We're seeking shelter from the fascist oppressors.
And we're wet.
Can I interest you in some hashish?
I'm not really supposed to.
Drugs do odd things to me at the moment.
Aren't they supposed to?
This is Matt.
You want a hit from the bong?
He is an artist.
"Truly, an artist."
I'm Toby.
His roommate.
"And this is of the purest, highest possible grade."
I assure you.
Cool!
Bravo!
All splendid fun.
Polly!
My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?
"I'm going to pretend that I don't smell that, Toby."
"Smell what, mon petit chou?"
"It's very, very naughty what you're doing, Toby."
Quite possibly.
Anyway.
I told them how the world really works.
"How there were predators, how we had to adapt."
"I led them here, under the great ice."
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
"Well, we all have a purpose."
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
"Wait and see, Will."
You wait and see.
[ELEPHANT SEALS GRUNTING]
[BOTH ROARING]
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?
"Don't know, but it sure is ugly."
"Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?"
Right.
"Outside, now!"
We are outside.
"- Come on, then."
- No... you come on.
MUMBLE:
Excuse me.
Bryan?
- Huh?
MUMBLE:
Down here.
"Ah, g'day, chief."
What are you doing here?
"Bryan, I need a favor."
A big one.
"For you, champ, anything."
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
[Breathes deeply]
"Well, I try really fucking hard."
- [Laughs]
- So I'm glad you noticed.
[Sighs]
"So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?"
Hmm.
"No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out."
[Gasps]
- Yeah.
- Mnh-mnh.
"- Yes, you did."
"- No, trust me."
"If I was fucking freaking out, the police would be notified, helicopters would be deployed."
We'd have hounds released.
"Well, can we at least be on the news?"
News?
"Baby, it would be the top fucking story."
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
I need a drink.
You want one?
You know I can't have a drink.
Don't tempt me with that.
"It's empty calories, you little sorceress vixen."
[Laughs] You're a woman!
"Yeah, a woman you just fucked."
[Sighs]
I'll be right back.
[Sighs]
[Cellphone buzzes]
[Sighs]
Champagne?
"- Whoa, baby!"
- What are we celebrating?
We're celebrating that we've been living together for a month.
Almost.
OK...
To being flatmates for a month.
- Almost.
"- Sit down, please."
"So, what are we having, then?"
- Having?
- Dinner?
In the oven!
Did you like what you just saw?
Yes.
You're a very attractive woman.
But I think we should just keep it as flatmates.
Having a good time doesn't have to change anything.
"You have needs, and I have needs."
What would be more sensible than to try and fulfil those needs   in the comfort of our own home?
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Sit down!
Turn off your brain and relax.
"Camilla, I don't..."
Just relax.
- Camilla...
- Shhh!
(music gets more aggressive)
(music stops abruptly)
Sorry!
Sorry.
I guess it's time for a shower.
"I need to go back to Abnegation, maybe."
Sort out what our parents left behind.
At least I'd be useful there.
"Caleb, there's nothing left at Abnegation."
Yeah.
You Okay?
Just need to get to Candor.
Tris.
"I know you think Caleb is your responsibility, but he made his own choice."
You can't protect everyone.
(CHUCKLES)
I can't protect anyone.
Nobody can.
Him leaving isn't your fault.
None of this is your fault.
(SIGHS)
Johanna was right.
You have to forgive yourself.
Thank you.
WOMAN ON PA:
All factions have been instructed to
-maintain a strict curfew until further notice.

Repeat.
All factions have been instructed to maintain a strict curfew until further notice.
- We found them.
-Yeah.
- HECTOR:
Four!
-(ALL GREETING)
"Damn, is it good to see you guys."
"How are you, Uriah?"
We are going to the hunting lodge
Bali Bey what are we waiting for?
Let's have a walk.
My legs are asleep
Let's wait a little bit more.
Maybe she'll come
Who will come?
There she is
Wait for me
You...
Are you following me?
Not a bit.
Why would I follow?
I'm not following
My gut tells me that there's a valuable jewellery here
Right Matrakçı?
Or are my eyes misguiding me?
Are not those the most beautiful eyes in the world?
"Nasuf Efend, Welcome Efendi"
Here my father.
Your dinner
Thanks my daughter
Your daughter?
Yes sir.
She's my daughter
Her name is Armin
Armin...
Who is the sir?
He is a very rich merchant
He wants to buy somethings
Really?
Anything you desire sir
Worse than you?
You don't say anything but I hear it.
Go away.
"You can't do it, I'll deal with him myself."
Here he comes.
You are...?
Don't you know me?
How can I not know you?
What's this?
You don't know me but you know her?
You stop.
"We are friends, right?"
- You come with me.
- Where to?
Dicky?
What's this dicky?
Not only at night he's different in day time also.
Actually we are not friends but lovers.
Are we lovers?
I don't believe it.
You must believe it.
How can I?
Was I such a violent guy?
- Remember it?
- Remember it?
How can he remember past with just one scene?
Continue it.
It happened like this then...
When?
"Did you think I forgot everything, right?"
I remember everything.
"What do you remember, sunny?"
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?
With Toxie lovemaking.
She's been established.
So there wasn't really too much we could do.
[Inaudible] [gasp]
"Yeah, baby."
It's good for the baby.
HEIDI SJURSEN:
"Oh, baby."
[Moan]
[Moan]
Cut.
It's done that way just to [inaudible].
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I'm just trying to convince the actress
"To take her clothes off, something which was contracted"
"To, and something which was agreed upon,"
"Something which was rehearsed, and something"
Which was pre-recorded on tape.
INTERVIEWER:
And this isn't gonna happen?
That's what's going on.
But now we're gonna shoot Toxie.
Who's doing Toxie's makeup?
Anybody doing Toxie's makeup?
Or are we not making this movie?
"Yeah, we have somebody who's doing it."
[Chatter]
MAN:
"Lloyd, it was a closed set."
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yes, I agree."
But people can stand by.
It looks firm enough if we walk on the edge there.
"- Uh, sod that, you're carrying me."
- What?
"Shoes, 300 quid, come on."
Down you go.
Spoken like a true lady.
"Paul, be careful!"
"Luke, my shoes!"
"Quickly, before they fall in the mud!"
"- Oh, my goodness!"
- Ugh... elegance.
Elegance!
Hop on.
"Right, here we go."
So...
How've you been?
Good.
"Great, actually."
- You?
- Okay.
Course has definitely been an eye-opener
Really?
"Yeah, you meet all these different kinds of people."
"I mean, most of 'em work their arses off to get what we just take for granted."
Makes you realise you're not quite as special as you once thought.
"Bloody hell, Chris, that was bordering on self-deprecation."
Is it working?
"You haven't changed at all, have you?"
- What's the matter?
- Not funny...
Great.
Hi.
So you didn't do anything to those women?
No.
Then where did you go every night?
- My part time job.
- Job?
Part-time?
So you bought meat with that money?
Yeah!
So why did you bring that dog here?
It's only skin and bones.
Not even worthy to eat.
Big trouble!
Big trouble!
Come out!
Your daughter and Mr. Hong...
Mr. Hong kidnapped your daughter!
Come out!
What?
I came here to take the plates back.
Hold on tight!
Stop the car!
Hey!
Stop the car!
Get closer!
"This motorcycle is so slow, what's wrong with it?"
Pull me up!
That damn bastard!
Is everyone still on?
"Dad, over there!"
I wasn't planning on killing you.
But you're just like the other bitches.
All hookers like you playing with all kinds of men have to die.
Sorry.
Little last-minute broadcast come through.
EMERSON:
I'll inform the authorities.
katherine:
You do that.
-Wanna hear my latest theory?
-Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
-Long-term tactical formations.
-Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
EMERSON:
Could be.
"-lt's good, right?"
-Yeah.
katherine:
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
-EMERSON:
That's nice.
"-Ah, give me something."
EMERSON:
We're up two hours early next shift.
-You guys been waiting long?
"-No, you're good."
-Good shift?
-EMERSON:
Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
It was nice.
"You know, my contract's up pretty soon."
Hang on.
Let me close the restaurant.
He is here.
Take it.
Thank you very much.
I'll leave.
Shall I drop you somewhere?
Thanks.
I've a knowledge of every nook and corner of this locality.
Bye.
"Your article by Sadhana is very good, isn't it?"
It requires a big heart to appreciate you
- Mom.
Get me chappathis.
Despite owning a restaurant
You are still eating mom's food.
I know where this conversation will end.
Don't be boring.
Okay?
Welcome.
"Did the elderly man ask for food, today as well?"
No.
"But, how did you know that it was me?"
"Your deodorant brand is Nivea, right?"
You are awesome.
"I forgot to pay the bill, yesterday."
How much was it?
- It's Okay.
If I get the money
The credit for the good deeds will go to you.
No need.
Sorry.
This is just fine.
Thank you very much.
No.
Thank you very much.
You've made me very happy.
"Very, very happy."
Where's Clark?
"He's talking to Grandma, sitting on the bench."
I saw them shake hands.
I feel as though I saw something very nice.
That's wonderful!
And the boy a rose did see
"The tone, it's all fixed!"
Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?
How about that?
Let's sing!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field
Bravo!
You sound like angels.
This was amazing.
Is this Uncle's room?
This is your bed.
"Oh, my God."
Okay?
Okay.
Not bad!
# He sang as if he knew me #
Will.
# In all my dark despair #
We're finished.
# And then he looked right through me # # as if I wasn't there #
"Will, come on."
"Will, we're finished."
"So there I was, killing them softly with my song."
"Or rather, being killed."
"And not that softly, either."
I was singing with my eyes closed.
Was I frightened?
I was petrified.
This was definitely not island living.
# Killing me softly #
# With his song ##
"Thank you, Finsbury."
I'd like to introduce one or two members of the band.
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.
And that's about it.
Let's get off quick.
Get off.
"Marcus, thank you."
For the song.
You were terrific.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate."
Okay.
How about McDonald's?
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
Severe lower body trauma.
Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey, how's it going?"
I hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.
Yeah.
I'm working the Pine Street Bombings.
"I'm her partner,"
Dr. Diego Soto.
Hey.
Sandman.
Golden age.
Nice.
Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh, why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one, please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"Hey, did you see psycho there?"
"Oh, yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.
I have every issue of Sandman.
Mint condition.
"You know, if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh, I am."
I love them when they're silly.
"But if they get too silly, they have to come see me."
"- ""Silly""?"
- Mischief.
- Trouble.
- We use gentler terms.
As a policy.
"Well, so what happens when they come see you?"
"Well, we do things a little differently in our program."
The approach is progressive and positive.
"We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids."
"Because 99% of the time, all kids need"
- is a hug.
"- ""A hug""?"
- A squeeze.
"- Well, you squeeze 'em."
- An embrace.
- Oh.
- Oh?
- Well...
- What is it?
- Nothin'.
- Wayne.
- Yeah?
- Speak freely.
"- No, I'd better not."
That's the only way we'll get to know each other.
But do you ever smack 'em?
- Excuse me?
"- Like, give 'em a good whack?"
- I don't follow.
- Do you ever hit the kid?

Sonakshi I really liked that you attended the party.

He was nominated like everybody else.
Everybody knows the party arranges nomination of judges.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on yours...

But I smell a hanging party.
We should put distance between ourselves...

Distance!
Distance is something you do to your enemies.
It's the thing of the '90s to make friends extinct.

They are holding a party to celebrate!
You still remember this song?
"Of course I remember, you cruise chick with this song."
"Play it again, Sam!"
You want a woman?
What?
"You dirty pimp, leave my husband alone!"
"The soup's tasteless, add some soya sauce!"
What?
Add some soya sauce!
Did you say 'Get some sort of toys'?
Did you...?

I think I'm having goose bumps.
Oh!
The minbar can go right there.
And my office can be in that room with the family
- Of angry racoons!
- Yes!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Why is there a team
- With a wrecking ball out front?
"- Like I said, the place is scheduled for demolition."
- [Together]:
Today?
"- Yeah, in 15 minutes or so."
"But don't worry, guys!"
I can find you a place exactly like this...
probably.
- Can't we stop them?
- No.
Only the mayor can stop the demolition now.
- How do you even know that?
- She likes to brag.
"You guys really want this place, don't you?"
- More than anything!
- Huh.
- OK.
You go find Ann and I'll stay here and make sure
- They don't tear it down.
- Brilliant!

Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like, I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
- I promise.
- Okay.
And you damaged our cargo.
CALEB:
These are Abnegation fabric bolts.
"And you're Factionless, right?"
- Caleb.
-I used to be Abnegation.
We used to use those same bolts to make clothes for you.
You're saying that we're stealing from you?
No.
"No, no, no."
I'm no longer Abnegation.
"So technically you're not stealing from me, but... (STAMMERS) No, you're not stealing at all."
"I mean, maybe."
"It's a question of semantics, I suppose, whether it's stealing or charity."
(STAMMERING) But it's all really the same.

I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 10 grand, don't you think?"
I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.

Edward has long been expected by our mother.
"Come as soon as you can, Edward."
"Remember, you're always welcome."
- Can't you take him with you?

Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen...
Forgive me.
Miss Dashwood...
Elinor...
I must speak to you.
There is something of great importance that I need to tell you...
about my education.
- Your education?
- Yes.
It was conducted.
"oddly enough, in Plymouth."
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth?
No.
I was four years there.
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.
- Pratt?
- Precisely.
Pratt.
While I was there...
"That is to say, he had a..."

You're needed in London this instant.

They lack personnel.
Serious?
Let's go eat where you work.

Stay up here.
We'll only shoot each other down there.
Shit.
Congratulations.
How could anybody Fuck up so much in one night?
Poscher?
Dead.
The 3rd Hiromitsu?
Stolen.
And Maya?
Disappeared without a trace.
What?
But her apartment was under constant surveillance.
"They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left."
"She was gone, when the replacement came."
I don't get it.
Why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either.
Until this arrived.
What is it?
The Hiromitsu file.
It took our colleagues in NewYork sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
"As it turns out, he didn't commitsuicide"
I just invented him.
What are you?
A clerk?
- Keep silence!
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, I'm promised to study law."
"Very well, Mr. Dawlish."
"- Ready for inspection, sir."
- Thank you.
The usual beach combings.
It'll take hard work.
They haven't been sworn yet.

I appeal.
- What?
- I'm a gentleman.
- An impostor.
- I questioned him.
"Excuse me, sir."
- Mr. Scott-Padget?
- I must ask you not to turn your back.
"- I apologize, sir."
- My other duties...
"- Until dismissed, your duty is with me."

"Come on, boys!"
"One, two, heave!"
"One, two, heave!"
Secure the camp.
I've got a score to settle.
We have all had our fill of Jacob Moore.
So I'm seizing the ship and taking command.
Stow the prisoners below.
Prepare to set sail.
You're abandoning Moore?
That I am.
Weigh anchor!
Up sheets!
Hands to the jeers!

Let's get clear of this godforsaken place.
Let's go!
Come on.
We need to drink.
Please.

What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We are being pursued.
Let us go.

"They'll understand, don't worry."
Anything else?
Your appointment is here.
Who is this guy?
Remind me.
Joseph Kay.
Heads up a department at St. Louis.
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?
Something like that.
"""Something like that."""
"""I'm not sure what he wants."""
What's that supposed to mean?
Why send him to me?
- You were recommended.
- By who?
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.
I see.
- Your daughter called.
"- Oh, yeah?"
She left you messages at home and...
Romeo.
"Oh, no."
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."
No.
No.
No.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no."
So pale?
My best beloved husband lies here dead.
Not Romeo.
My child.
Not him of all.
"Oh, what unkind hour has brought to pass this miserable deed."
"Alas, my lady, we are overturned."
No.
A greater power than we can contradict has thwarted all our plans.
"Come away from death, contagion and unnatural sleep."
Leaving my husband to face this alone?
The watchman.
"My lady, come away."
Unkind!
To drink it all and leave no drop so I could follow after.
"Nay, good my lady."
Listen now and come.
I will hide you in a sisterhood of nuns.
"Stop, stop, not to question why."
- We must away.
- You go.
I must bid farewell to Romeo.
"Stay then, until you are at peace."
But linger not.
The three of us are to leave immediately.
"By ""immediately"", I do presume you mean after breakfast?"
Since I've paid for it.
D'ARTAGNAN:
"I think we should wait for Athos, let him know where we are going."
Wait how long exactly?
(DOOR OPENS)
I'm going to have to start charging you lodgings.
You're here so often.
Is this a complaint?
Do I look dissatisfied?
"- (LAUGHING) No, no."
- (GRUNTS)
I will not be responsible for distracting the Captain of the Musketeers from his duties.
"After all, the King and Paris depend on you."
(LAUGHING) I'll...
I'll get breakfast.

Get out!
Who?
Then say so!
Why beat around the bush?
"Won't you go away, rascal?"
He was eating my head!
And why were you asking them?
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
This girl has shot into my heart like a bullet.
"She sells flowers, yet fires bullets."
That's why it's said that one cannot trust the female species.
When I was hit with the bullet the first time...
- ...it hadn't been so painful.
"- But the pain is sweet, isn't it?"
- But what next?
- What do you mean?
Will this matter proceed further or not?
How will it proceed further?
You know I cannot do a thing.
I too don't know anything.
I haven't fallen in love often.
Brother!
"How are you, brother?"
You're just after a Fredrick March type
That would be lovely
"Please, I'm serious"
I'll keep my eyes open
"Don't forget, will you?"
"Please, for Fujio's sake"
You're leaving?
Off to the Ginza Today's act of motherly love
My niece from Osaka arrives here tomorrow
It'll be good to see her again
I like the girl
"She's such a smart, tidy girl"
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Didn't know you had a sister like this
Be serious.
Silly
Goodbye
I'm getting hungry Is there anything to eat?
There are some biscuits
Something a little more solid?
Like what?
What is there?
Noodles?
Noodles?
How about sushi?
A bit too cold...
Then what...
Rice?
Topped with eel.
But then again...
You're hard to please
How cute.
Jackknife.
That technique isn't too bad.
All the different smashes in tennis sure benefit you guys.
Too bad your ball isn't high enough.
Sorry but I've checked your data.
The data won't lie.
If not for the data you would have played better.
- What are you doing?
- Woot?
Ugh.
What was that?
What was that?
Doing that by yourself.
Makes one so nostalgic.
"This Seigaku regular uniform,"
- Not too shabby.
- Heh?
"Let's have a game at the usual place, okay."
Let's go.
When did he come in...
- Everybody gather.
- Hai!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
The opposing team is Seishun Middle School finally we get to play.
I still haven't accepted you.
"Ah, I see."
"Hey, look at that."
What's this?
A chibi here.
How come even a chibi can become a regular.
Give it back to the women.
"Oh, thanks very much."
Little chap.
You're looking much better today.
Come on!
- Did you hear what that idiot asked of me?
"- No, what?"
- I wasn't allowed to take any holiday...
- Prisoners!
They're escaping!
Quickly!
- We must get away!
- What about John?
Better him than us.
Stop!
"Stop, or I'll shoot!"
"Come on, let's get away from here."
"Damn, it won't open!"
- The parcel has arrived.
- OK.
Let's have a look over there.
They're in there.
- Why didn't the capo come along?
- The town is crawling with militia.
- This is Smithy.
- Good work.
Thank you.
"For you, no effort was too great."
A tanker is going to take you out of town.
- The north would be too dangerous.
- I don't care about north or south.
- All I want is to fight Ramírez.
Owen...?
Flavors that are wow...
Dinner time honey...!
"....and these Thy gifts, for which we are about to receive,"
..please guide and direct us for all our days.
And protect us from evil.
Amen.
How was school today?
"you didn't go and spoil your dinner on me now, did you?"
Owen?
...No...
I didn't...
Eat.
"Please, honey."
Hello?
What?
"Look, I'm not gonna discuss this now?"
We're eating dinner
"we had an agreement, John."
I think maybe you better call my lawyer okay...?
Don't talk to me like that
I will not.
Be spoken to.
In that way!

Yes.
Tell me.
Are you Inspector Arivazhagan?
Indeed I am.
Tell me.
Are you really Inspector Arivazhagan?
"Who is this at my station, questioning me?"
"Hey, Panju!"
Sir!
- Come here!
Sir?
Find out what this man wants.
"Okay, Sir."
Come.
Did I really speak to the Inspector?
Yes.
Why are you bugging us?
"Tell me, is he really Inspector Arivazhagan?"
"Yes, he is."
You came so furiously to meet this very same Arivazhagan.
Manoj.
"Manoj, please relax."
I can understand that you are in some trouble.
Your car was involved in the accident.
The person with you must have driven the car.
Your intention of saving her is not wrong.
But a life has been lost.
"Don't get scared, Manoj."
We are not dealing this case officially.
"Only if you tell the truth, we can save you and your friend."
"Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense."
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

Don't get killed.

L'll give you full cooperation.
Good night.
You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story.
L'll arrange another meeting.

Kowalski!
Kill that light!
You better check the gun placements again.
I'm going to have a look-see.
Over there.
A heavy concentration to the south.
Let's see what Starlight-Starbright has to say.
That's a ruse.
"Kowalski, MacDaniel, pass the word."
Quietly.
Strengthen the north wall.
I repeat:
Strengthen the north wall.
Out.

They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.
"I'll do more recon, map out a route."
Gather all the guns
- we have.
- What can I do?
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.
"What, am I grounded?"
I do something wrong?
I didn't say you did.

"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
You get anything?
Yeah.
The cell that led us to Cutler?
Yeah.
Found something interesting on it.
What?
"All right, so according to Abby,"
Cutler used this phone exclusively to contact her.
Right.
But... look at this.
The last number Cutler dialed was to a different number.
Right.
And check out the time.
10:51.
"That's two minutes after the shooting started, which means that not only did Cutler not die instantly..."
He was alive long enough to place a phone call.
Let me see that.
Exactly.

We're sorry...

We need to find out who was on the other end.

"I mean, it,s not always easy, but -"
"So you,re not unhappy."

What do I check?
"I don,t know."
"Put ,slightly unhappy, if you want."
"I don,t want anything."
"It,s up to you."
What do you want?
"She doesn,t know and neither do I!"
"Don,t check anything!"
Fine.
"Then we,re done."
"Good, we,re done."
"Let,s have a drink."
How about having a drink with us?

Are you allowed during work hours?
"It,s not that."
"We,re way behind schedule."

"Listen, we were wondering:"
How did you end up working here?
"- You think it,s weird?"
"- I,m not criticizing."
"It,s just... you dissect people, examine them, manipulate them."
"We don,t manipulate anyone."
I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk?
Always.
Is something wrong?
I know you have high aspirations for me
So in the spirit of full disclosure
There's something you need to know
Something that may... it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer...
I had an affair
With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she...
Well she paid me.
Well...
Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.

"Dale, it's Gig."
- His machine.
- Oh.
"Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here."
"Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify."
So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."
Look who it is.
An old face from the past.
That's lovely.
Yes.

"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
From the male emerges the female.
Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderesky.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths,"
I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now.
You're going to flip out.
"Alicia, my dear, farewell."
Oh... dear...
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."

"Seba was shot, right?"
"Don't you worry about that, Pablo"

Just...
I'm all right.
"Built in 1972, then demolished the following year before being rebuilt in 85, the Bulwer-Lytton building is a classic example of the late modernist, post-Bauhaus development from humanist rationalist impulses from utility."

Psst!

- Was my fault.
God... so inefficient...
Well...
Let's go!
Please enter on the collapsed tunnel.
In about 500 meters there's the place we are searching for.
"Ram, don't run."
"Male, pay attention to your steps."
Yes.
"Lieutenant, what happened?"
Don't worry.
Male stepped over a landmine.
Really?
In a place like that?
You are not scared.
Aren't you?
Leave me alone...
"Lieutenant, be careful please."
Right now a heat source has become visible.
Ok!
Let's change location.
"Everyone, listen!"
There is something lurking in the ruins at the west.
It's not like they are unarmed people.
We will take a walk before exploring underground.
Let's start the procedure as usual.
Launch the UAV.
The enemy is already moving.
Hurry!
Arrest me!
I'm asking for police custody!
I'm a criminal!
Arrest me!
Jeffrey... my friend.

Are you fucking crazy or what?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Somebody was crying for help.
"The bride was tied up, her clothes all torn."
"I tried to help, but the Devil and Dracula attacked me."
Then they all just disappeared.

{\i1\cH80ffff}They thought we were too poor... {\i1\cH80ffff}...and stupid to understand.
yes... {\i1\cH80ffff}...but we are not stupid.

Be careful.

What makes the malaysian rainforest promising
Is that it's extremely old.

Something or the other.

You'll understand.
Now come along.
"Aw, but you said I could."
You promised.
I never have any fun.
"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
"Aw, but you saw."

I would have won... honest.
"No, Trelane."

Who are you?
Who is Trelane?
You must forgive our child.
The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
He will be punished.
We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.

- Should it?
Is it important?
"Yes, it is important."
Monitor response?
- The air is stale in here.
- The ventilator's closed.
- Well?
- Zero response.
There's nothing I can do.
It will have to be replaced.
I shall need laser transfer linkage.
Have you got any?
"I think so, in the storage hold."
I'll go and check.
"Stay here, I'll get it."
You'll need a torch.

In the town of Hamelin Many years ago
The citizens were crying out A tearful tale of woe
"""Rats, rats, rats!"
They chase the dogs And kill the cats
"Rats, rats, rats!"
"They build their nest In our Sunday hats"""
The citizens of Hamelin
Were frantic with despair
They gnashed their teeth And stamped their feet
And shouted to the mayor
"""Rats, rats, rats!"""
"The people cried ""We've gotta get rid of the rats"
"Gotta get rid of the rats In Hamelin town"""
Rats!
Rats!

Already expended it?
Just got 30 acres of vineyard.

"Good, the analyses, are not of the best ones."

"-Immediately, Professor."
This one is not a wonder either.
"It is clear, tomorrow we will make a small intervention and we will fix to him definitively."
Contentment?
"Cicchirini, take care of the preparations."
"It neglects, Professor."
"-Oh, Professor."
"-You let me pass, young lady?"

"Well, we followed with the habitual injections."
"You are in charge, Ms Cappia..."
Cappa...?
"Cappi, Profesor."

"We made use to him, Doctor?"
It is already all preparation.
-All ready one.
-Calm.
Calm...
To this one it is necessary to operate to him emergency.
"Tomorrow no he can, happened is strike,"
"Now comes the weekend, we will operate Monday to him."
What happens?
Who has died?
You!
-You have been!
-No.
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (GUNSHOT)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'll hold the king as hostage.
We'll shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
GIRL:
Beautiful!
BOTH:
Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, Excellency."
- Claudette.
Ah.
Velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, Claudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
"I was shocked too, though."
We're very sorry.
Not at all.
No problem.
So why my computer?
There's this...
This what?
"Amazing stuff, ...you've got here!"
He's sucking up.
Dead right.
Top of the line.
Must be expensive?
"To buy, yes."
But I rent.
"Not including the special stuff, it's about a million a year."
A million!
I invented some stuff in high school.
"Royalties from that... and these games, ...bring in quite a lot."
Know this?
Did you make
The Last Legend?
Just the basic program.
That and Craps and Rappies...
Are they well-known?
Don't you know?
So what are you researching now?
Tempo-spatial applications of gravitational physics.
Or put simply...
Don't laugh.
A time machine.
There's already a way to leap to the future.
Liquid nitrogen.
Only if you believe it is.
Sometimes I believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
That is an excellent practice.
"However, just at the moment, you really might want to focus on the Jabberwocky."
"Where's your champion, Sister?"
Here.
"Hello, Um."
Six impossible things.
"Count them, Alice."
"One, there's a potion that can make you shrink."
(ROARS)
"Two, and a cake that can make you grow."
"So, my old foe, we meet on the battlefield once again."
We've never met.
"Not you, insignificant bearer."
"My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one."
That's enough chatter.
(JABBERWOCKY SHRIEKING)
"Three, animals can talk."
"Four, Alice, cats can disappear."
"Five,"
there's a place called Wonderland.
"Six,"
I can slay the Jabberwocky.
(ROARS)
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!
(SCREECHING)
(BANDERSNATCH ROARING)
(JABBERWOCKY SCREECHING)
Off with your head!
Kill her!
Ah.
"Dakers, it was."
I shouldn't think this place was quite her style -- a bit quiet for her.
"She's rather marvelous, isn't she?"
Mm.
She has married again?
LYALL:
"Number five, I think."
POIROT:
"Oh, mon Dieu."
LYALL:
"Looks a bit of a gorilla, doesn't he?"
"An animal attraction, would you think, Mr. Poirot?"
Well...
"Well, well, well, things are looking up."
Hello?
Hello.
"Been looking all over the place for you, little lady."
"Not out fishing today, Major?"
"Yes, earlier."
Didn't have much luck.
"Perhaps, Major Barnes, you were fishing too close to the shore."
I noticed you by the harbor.
I expect you're right.
Too much damn dynamiting going on.
Dynamiting?
The fishermen drop dynamite around here.
Damned lazy beggars.
"The fish, not being fools, keep out at sea."
[ Chuckles ]
[ Vehicle approaching ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
"Could, and less for men ..."
Sorry.
It was a joke.
"- Of course you would, right?"
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Immediately.
This is the second glass?
Addons We are ready for the game.
Yes!
Addons Touch the screen to read terms and conditions.
I accept the terms and conditions.
Yes?
- Wait!
- Accept.
Do not read it all.
It is the law.
Conditions ...
Nonsense ...
No one read it.
"Addons you have not read the terms and conditions, want to continue?"
- Yes!
- Why not?
"Addons Please note, that to win the prize,"
Addons game should be played until the end.
"Disruptive Addons every player game, will bear the consequences."
What are the consequences?
Addons By knowing that at all you like confrontation online
"Addons to answer a simple question, profiles connected to each other."
- Dave?
- Yes.
Addons you started.
Slowly.
"No. no, no, no."
Did--did you see that--that guy
With the--with that--that gun?
It--it erases your short-term--no.
Psst.
What the hell is up with you two?
Now who are you working for?
Secret service.
"But a department that you, sir, know nothing about."
I doubt that.
Now what department?
"It's a, um, archival department."
You're filing clerks
Running around shooting stun guns
At your own people?
"Oh, we didn't shoot you."
"All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys."
- Yeah.
Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I'll take it from here.
"Careful, archives."
"Paper cuts, they take days to heal."
That's hilar-- you're hilarious.
Very scared.
- So glad to see you.
- Thank you.
Not a damn word.
"Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse."
That is all.
Thank you.
The meeting's over.
Send the car.
Any new transfers recently?
Just a moment.
"No, not a single one."
"The police identified the body of reporter Takeshi Kurosaki, age 35."
His investigative reports unveiled a series of university scandals.
"The cause of death is unknown, but foul play isn't ruled out."
That was close!
Did you hit these?
I think so.
You broke the dolphin.
Who's that?
From the Administration.
And who are you?
Haven't seen you around.
This is Rin.
Department?
I'm not a student.
So you can't join the team.
"Ryuji, Iet her apply."
"If you can hit that strong, you should apply."
Alright!
I'm soaked!
Right down to the underwear.
This way.
It's quite easy to apply.
What's that?
A special training facility.
It's a restricted area.
"OK, I think we'll do physics, please."
"You've chosen physics, and we now reveal exactly what you'll be looking for."
"You'll have ten seconds to confer as a team, and then you answer on your own."
"Remember, you've got two passes, but the one wrong answer and your team will be locked out of the hive."
"So, you've chosen physics as a topic."
You are looking for electrical components.
You've got ten seconds to confer.
Ammeter...
"Diode, transistor..."
Ohmmeter...
Transformer.
"Batteries, Capacitor..."
Bulb.
"Capacitor, yes."
Resistor...
Time's up.
"Ned, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, two passes should you need them."
"You're looking for electrical components, reveal the hive."
Transistor.
"Transistor, correct."
Oliver.
You can pass.
Pass.
Marianne.
One pass left. 20 seconds.
One pass left.
Diode.
"Diode, correct."
Ned.
Pass.
Oliver.
I'm gonna go poop now
"Yep, go pump it out"
Yes ma'am
"Me, the hunter..."
Bon...
"Don't scare me like that, I almost peed my pants"
Bon...
Yes?
Bon...
I love you!
"Ever since we met on ""Monster Hunter"" online"
I'm a gross Otaku but I love you
With my spearing soul
I think Miyu is being physically and mentally abused
I am taking Miyu home
Miyu looks her best when she is smiling
She doesn't deserve to be sad
Yeah
"Also, you are being watched"
He's asleep
"No, I mean that"
What?
It's Lin's smartphone
It's out of the box
What's this?
This is being broadcast online
"There should be some people watching, including Lin's younger sister"
Is that a joke?
I'm serious
Which website?
"Hey, Bon?"
Which website?
So many choices.
It's not even practice and that one there is doing laps.
Isn't she pushing herself hard enough?
Remember when I pushed you?
It was just upstairs in the music room.
"Yes, I remember."
Do you remember the music you made?
[Piano playing]
It was perfect.
It made you perfect.
She can be perfect.
She shouldn't have to be.
[Gasps]
How long ago?
She was seen heading toward the pool about five minutes ago.
Where is it?
Just around the corner.
He can't get you now.
You're safe.
Open them up.
I can't. they lock from the inside.
That area is shelter in place.
Get around the corner.
Get around the corner!
There's something else about me that you should probably know.
[Groaning]
[Metallic clatter]
James:
There you are.
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Come on.
Just breathe.
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
"Tits, Franco."
"That's what real tits look like,"
OK?
Johnny giant fake boob.
"Yeah, well, excuse me for"
"Being an American, OK?"
I like to suck on big tits.
Now it's a political issue?
I'm a terrorist because I like
Real tits?
"It's political, what are you"
Talking about?
What about the sad fags?
What sad fags?
"Guys, guys."
Are we actually arguing about
"Tits, come on."
Ladder.
Batallion.
"You know what, guys."
I know this address.
My cousin's a sculptor.
He used to have a studio in this
Place.
It's like a whole warehouse.
"It's divided up into, like a"
"Million, tiny little rooms."
Just keep your head straight
"Cause you get lost in there, it"
Can get real confusing real
"Fast, you know?"
You got a cousin who's a
He was always joking
He'd imitate a horse when I needed cheering up
"An alcoholic, a hopeless drunk"
This is my husband.
Now he sells door to door
And this one
He's a millionaire with influence
Will he remember me?
What's wrong?
Crying?
Leave her alone
- Who asked you anything?
- What?
What did you dare say?
You heard me
You are completely crazy
I've heard that before
Don't touch me
I'm never going to
"You're beneath anything, you're disgusting"
A stupid egoist.
You're putrid.
And to think I loved you
I still owe you one
"I loved you, you hear?"
I had all your letters.
I'd find your hairpin and save it
What a joke
"Stop it, Julien..."
It hurts
Let me go
Clementine?
I never imagined it could be you!
With age a person's reflexes slow down
Don't blame yourself.
It's said...
"T o err is human, and you're not even human!"
How's that?
Good?
Who is Jin Tianyun to you?
We share a complex relationship
It's now close to the end
Let's forget all that meaningless talk!
Come!
Is it Gao Jian?
What do you call that stance?
Good!
Very good!
Stop!
"Gao Jian, will you ever obey your elders?"
Y es!
Please teach us the stances... which you used to kill that old fart
Don't you fear betraying your own school?
Of course not.
"There's only me, you and him"
"That's right, you can teach us step by step"
Nobody will know!
That's right!
Okay!
"- Good morning, sweetheart."
- Hi.
Still in love with that coat?
What coat?
- Our guests arrive today.
- precisely.
You blockhead!
"These are the great geniuses of our time, gathered together in our home!"
They are a gang of parasites.
"After a few days in their company, I expect you'II come to your senses."
You'II humiliate me if you don't receive them.
charles!
You don't want me to be a success!
Gustav?
Gustav!
Attach little bags of seed to the branches.
I want thousands of birds singing when they come up the avenue.
darling?
You're not dressed properly.
Go and put on your pink waistcoat.
- (gunshot)
- Oh!
That murderer!
There won't be a bird left in the sky!
welcome!
Yes.
"Come on, HeIene."
welcome!
"In my house, you are the nobility."
The nobility of genius.
Madame Sand!
- hello.
How was your trip?
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
What?
"Dreaming about him like that,"
It's got to mean something.
What are you talking about?
"(karen:)come on, two nights in a row?"
Dreams are our subconscious working out
"What we can't, or won't, awake."
So mom used to tell me.
The last time we saw da veiga
He was chasing us through the jungle with a pistol.
What's to work out?
"(karen:)you're not sure he survived,"
Are you?
"(syd:)nigel, run!"
[struggling]
[explosion]
"(nigel:)syd, syd."
(karen:)are you okay?
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Um...
Did you set up our first meeting?
"Yeah, gareth watson,"
The druid expert
At bristol polytechnic.
He sent this fax confirming.
Meet him in his office.
[âª]
You're not really taking any of her
"Pop psychology mumbo jumbo to heart, are you?"
"Keep the change, thanks."
"I must admit,"
We're still a little unclear
You can't possibly be.
Yes.
The new owner of the Standish Tavern.
Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures.
Foreclosure?
You don't have to thank me.
I knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment.
I just dropped by to make final arrangements.
I can't leave without ensuring that my interests...
... arelookedafter by someone I can trust.
"Oh, no."
Never.
I will never work for you.
"Fine, if that's your attitude."
I'll find another bartender.
Bartender?
Then who's the manager?
I came. I saw. I conquered.
Wait.
Just tell me one thing.
Why?
Why here?
Why me?
"Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son."
We're business people.
And we're the best at what we do.
Don't ever forget that.
"Yes, indeed."
Previously on Vanished...
Jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
Good.
- Sit up for me.
Tonight you will face your final test.
- Mr. Porter.
- Mr. Avery.
- I took a look at it.
- And?
- It's chockfull of laudanum and what I think is Indian root.
And it appears to have trace amounts... of aconite.
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.
Wolf's bane.
"A poison, Mr. Porter."
"Not enough to kill you, but certainly enough to have rather unpleasant effects... on your mind."
- Congratulations.
You found us.
One final test... for your commitment.
Who do you see?
- Margaret.
- And why do you think she's here?
"- She whispered lies into my mind, sowed doubts within me."
She tried to turn me against you.
"- No, Isabel."
- She must be punished.
- Please.
- You will be my star.
Cleanse her with the lash.
Her screams will be her sacrament of reconciliation.
"- Isabel, please!"
Please!
Help me!
Please help!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Look at her
"Pablo, my god Pablito"
And what is this?
A surprise - yes?
This is Angela
- Hello
But what is it?
"A surprise, you'll see it inside"
He used to write every month but now it's been over a year
Without any news from him
Did you marry?
Don't tell me you got married without noticing me
Not until we have a flat
Catalina
- Hello son
Hello Angela
Is this you as a baby?
Very cute
Do you like moscatel?
"Yes, she likes it"
But don't serve us anything we're leaving right away
"Yes, I like it"
The police has been looking for you
When?
Like 20 days ago
"Is that true, grandma?"
"yes, like 20 days ago or so"
But you're not robbing again are you?
"No way, that's just police routine"
"No, sir, it's from that solar system ahead."
Any interference?
Resistance?
"No, sir, just scanning beams."
It's on an unusual wavelength.
Mr. Spock?
It would appear someone is curious about us.
"Mr. Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
"Yes, sir."
"We're closing, sir."
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
"There's no hostility, sir."
"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, just increasing in intensity."
Steady.
Regular.
"It's growing stronger, sir."
- Captain!
"- Yes, what is it?"
"The alien, it's slowing down."
"Warp 5, 4, 2."
"It's going sublight, sir."
Sir...
- It stopped dead in space.
- He may be turning to fight.
"No, sir."
They're just dead out there.
Are you sure?
"Yes, sir."
Unmoving.
Then we've got him.
Go to red alert.
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
Dangaioh transformation successful.
Looks like they made it in time.
The problem is the intruders.
The security system has been completely destroyed.
"If we don't do something, they'll be able to infiltrate into the lowest level."
"Don't worry, the Commander will take care of it."
Dangaioh?
So that means they got past Fubuki?
"Go, Ankokuten!"
Buy us time until Mikazuchi comes back!
This is it?
"Okay, show me."
So it's sending false information to the computer...
Its processing capabilities are amazing.
Give it up!
"Boy, that felt good!"
We're not finished yet.
"Stand up, Ankokuten!"
Show them what you're really worth!
"Arise, Hikio!"

Huh?
Then what squadrons are those?
Did His Majesty send reinforcements?
Sion said he was putting me in charge of this!
There's no way he'd do that!
- Then...
- Don't tell me...
It's him?
That's impossible!
Crimson Fingered Claugh would ignore hostages and attack?
What do we do?
"If we lose after taking people hostage, we'll be executed!"
"No, we haven't lost yet..."
Let's kill the hostages.
I get it.
Roland doesn't think we're serious!
If we kill a hostage...
- Cease this!
- But...
You've all done well.
But this is it.
Let us release the hostages.
"But, Princess..."
I shall do all I can.
With my life alone!
You must not!
I cannot allow the Princess to die alone...
"I, too..."
"I shall accompany you, Princess!"
I guess you never leave here.
These savages and cowards only hunt the weak.
"Noah admits, 're dead meat."
"No, we are emperor penguins."
-With pride.

"We are courage, we are brave."
We are the glorious Empress nation.

This is my daughter!
What smart!
"The union of nations, This is what solidarity is."
"Well, now what?"
"Now, they managed a stay of execution."
Who are you?
-A idiot.
Thank you.
"Bo, you got it."
"Hello friends, you came."
Sure we have come.
Told Us.
-Where is Ramon?
They will pay anything to prevent it.
This is the first step towards my becoming

"Yeah, sure."
I know where everything is.

"Shit, someone's coming."
"Shit, they're shooting."
No ...

What are you ...
Henning?
Do not tell anyone.
"I'm not gay, you know?"
You heard something that seemed shots?
"No, not really."
I could not hear anything with the helmet.
We were wondering if Henning had not killed.

- Nothing?
The very time when you should have.
We call that dumb insolence.
"Bring the lamp closer, carpenter."
- There is a trace of worm.
- I thought you should know.
Nothing a little whitewash won't cure.
It might make its way to the midshipmen's berth.
You should look.
If you think it important.
Somebody being taught his manners?
"Overdoing it, isn't he?"
- That will do.
"- Aye, sir."
"All right, get up."
- What is he being punished for?
- Cutting his initials on the table.
- Where is this trouble you mentioned?
- Chapman!
All I see is a patch of uncoated timber.
Is that all?
"I thought you should see, sir."
- The wind's freshening.
- Why have you reversed my orders?
- Sir?
- I wanted the gallants set.
- But I find nothing.
- I judged...
"You judged, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
You judged?
- It's good seamanship.
- You're impertinent.
RB is very confident this time.
It's RB's habit to tell tall tales.
You should never underestimate your competitor.
Right?
I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order.
For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations..
..signs the next 10 years' agreement only with our company.
"Don't worry, sir."
We will try our best.
Not try.
Results.
Definitely.
You are working so hard.
It's very late.
Go to sleep.
Coming.
I will just finish this and come.
Okay?
Hey.
- Hey.
I will see you.
- Yeah.
The designs.
What is this?
Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well?
But have a look..
If our company starts working on the sketches made by you..
..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got.
Unbelievable!
Hey.
- Hey.
What happened?
With a pistol... as was the custom of this kind of execution...
"He fired the ""coup de grace""."
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep

When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?

Twenty two
Have you got any brothers and sisters?
Four
Are they all in the Mainland?
Yes
You have great responsibilities
"Yes, come..."
"Let me tell you, she..."
"Learn your duties, obey orders and no harm will come to you."
"Remember, the only enemy is the Frenchman."
"Read these men the Articles of War, they are compulsorily enlisted."
"Now, you may proceed with your other duties."
"Thank you, sir."
Muster on the forecastle.
I'll read the Articles.
Turn forward and follow me.
Get them moving!
Use your starter!
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Jump to it, you swabs!"
Anchors aweigh!
Up aloft there.
Come on.
"Look lively, lads."
Next!
Next!
Set the foresail.
Give her the mainsail.
Lift the jib!
Full speed!
"- Don't look down, swab!"
"- Keep them moving, damn your eyes!"
"Go higher, you scum!"
Last man down sent for punishment!
Get them moving there!
"Come on, there."
Jump to it!
"Come on, jump to it!"
That's not good enough.
We'll do it again.
"Linking, sir."
"Full-power acceleration from orbit, Mr. Scott."
"Full power, sir."
"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment,"
Mr. Sulu.
"Standing by to warp, sir."
Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command?
Not yet.
They may trace our beam.
Wait until we're well out of range.
"Can we know his range, Captain?"
We can take an educated guess-- at the point we entered their solar system.
Still no sign of pursuit.
"Instruments clear, sir."
Good.
May I take a moment to change?
"Yes, I think you might."
Turn in your glass slippers.
The ball is over.
"Gladly, Captain."
Hard to believe that it ever happened.
"Captain, we're about to warp."
Large body ahead.
Collision course.
"Hard to port, Mr. Sulu."
"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
Gothos!
Have we been going in circles?
No.
All instruments show on-course.
Gothos again.
Hard over.
Do you believe in prayer?
Not really.
Neither do I.
My dad always prays.
So does mine.
Do you wanna try it?
Try praying'?
Okay.
How is he?
Still dying.
"Well, you've almost mastered another skill, though."
That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
Non-specific signs of inflammation.
That's it?
We also swabbed for staph.
Negative.
He's not even a carrier.
"Well, at least foreman was wrong too."
"Yeah, there's that."
Can I go to joe's apartment now?
No.
Go back to the lab.
Start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.
For what?
Everything.
"Bacteria, toxins, fungus."
Anything that likes to feast on brain.
That's thousands of... better hurry.
"Cameron, suit up."
You're gonna monitor foreman.
He's on to hand contractures.
"We stand in the shadows,"
"Protected by darkness,"
Hidden from light.
"So is it always,"
So shall it be.
Who comes before the gural nataz?
Stand and be recognized.
"Can we do without this, rennes?"
I've had a very bad day.
We're all anxious
"To hear from you, fabrice."
Maybe the great da veiga would like
To show his humiliation in private.
Rachel!
"You can't protect him forever, rennes."
Silence!
I bring bad news.
My courier has died from the wounds
He received fighting with the two thieves.
Then where are they now?
They're being tracked according
To standard protocol.
Where is the case?
Why haven't you sent a team
To cancel fox and bailey?
"I'm seeing to it, personally."
"Very good, fabrice."
But this council will not
Tolerate another failure.
I understand.
"So it is spoken,"
So shall it be.

You can ease their consciences
That's a tremendous power
We can't keep him for long

What do you think?
Did you shoot him?
Yeah
Good work
Right in the heart.
He died instantly
Tell me ifyou find anything odd

"Can you go to your room, please?"
Go to your room
- Is it about the ghost?
"- Go to your room, please"
- The ghost has gone
- Where to?
Back where he came from
How do you know he won't come back?
Because now he knows we don't need him
The police will come and ask you questions
They will want to know if you knew the ghost

Doesn't seem to believe in you.

"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.

I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
[goat bleats]
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."

"O'Herlihy, stick with me."
"Captain, impulses that direction."
"Very weak, possibly a survivor."
"Come on, Bones."

The Enterprise has responded to a call from Earth observation outpost on Cestus III.
"On landing, we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed."
"Captain, over there."

"Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain."
"He's in a bad way, captain."
"Keep him alive, Bones."
I want to know what's been happening here.
"Getting another life reading, captain."

You...?
Hello...
You don't recognise me?
I remember you very well
Can I ever forget a pirate?
- That's just as well
"Market news is, no one's willing to distribute your label with KK-Mix"
But I can sell
"Until now, you only trusted gentlemen"
"For once, try out a scoundrel"
"I will, if you stop pirating music"
Stipulating terms?
Even in distress?
That makes me feel like agreeing
"Okay, God be my witness."
No more piracy

Translate that into financial terms.
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.
That's why I like scientists.
"They're always discovering new, expensive things."
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.
I suppose you're going to have Tony
Split an atom bomb or something.
In effect Yes

Especially not us.
It will never go that far.

She'll take off our masts.
She'll lop them off!
Keep down.
Keep down.
"Goss, are you there?"
I'm...
"Boy, where's Mr. Goss?"
"On deck, sir."
For the flogging.
Flogging?
I authorized no flogging.
Twenty-three!
Twenty-four!
"Punishment completed, sir!"
Two dozen lashes!
- Cut him down!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Enjoy yourself?
"The trouble is, officially the problem doesn't exist."

- One acquires a frat detector.
Something that burns on a low light.
A little yellow flame which turns green the moment the frats appear.
That's one.
"There, madam."
I'll open the door for you.
Thank you!
"Do call again for frat oil, won't you?"

"Don't worry about that, Granville."
That's too advanced for you.

I'm not surprised!
"Oh, dear."

Well!
"But surely,"
This is very important evidence.
"I mean, mrs."
Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve
"Of her perpetrator, right?"
"All right, tell me, where is it?"
Where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably
At the crime scene?
We've been unable to locate it.
It disappeared...
"Just poof, hmm?"
"I mean, evidence that could prove"
That someone other than my client
Murdered victoria enright.
Yes.
So you wouldn't mind if they searched your house
"For that cuff link, would you?"
You're not gonna find it there.
Why?
Did you hide it somewhere else?
That's not what I meant.
No.
What you meant...
"Was to be judge and jury,"
Hiding evidence that would vindicate my client.
And you know what?
You very nearly succeeded.

Ataman!
Help us!
My cow!
My cow!
Ataman!
Those bandits have taken away my last cow.
"What did you expect, you fool?"
Get freedom without paying for it?
Didn't you scream when you gave birth to children?
And you expect to give birth to a new world without pain?
With no pain at all?
I've got small children.
It was my very last cow.
Your last!
"Remember this, silly woman:"
"Today they took away one cow, and tomorrow... they'll give you back ten!"
"- What do you mean, ten?"
- Just that.
Who had all the cows?
Who?
"I'm behind, but I'm thinking, ""You know,"
"I can lash pretty good, and I can lash fast."
"I'm going to catch up."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Here he comes, Rob."
Here he comes.
Paul finally made it.
Come on.
Let's go.
You need to get those lashings night and tight.
"Great job, dude."
Keep it up.
Keep it up.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" Done."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Done."
All right.
"Rob ""Robin Hood:"" So now I have to get my ammo, get my slingshot, and hit those three targets."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Rob's a champion archer."
That should help him with the slingshots.
Paul:
Okay.
I'm behind.
And I'm trying not to think about that.
"Because I knew if I was going to be able to take this,"
I had to tie my lashings tight.
Then I'm going to get up on the tower.
I really want to win this competition.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, come on, dude."
Paul's almost done.
You got this.
Aw!
Paul:
I got one more to go.
For the middle of nowhere.
You ready?
Come on.
Hey there.
"Hey, we're looking for, um,"
Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you?
"That's ok, we can come back."
"I'm sorry, but you look so familiar."
"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
I hope nothing is wrong here.
- No.
How long have you planned to stay here?
Now I'm planning to settle down.
Jimmy!
Hey!
What's the reason of my friend's worry?
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
"What do I say, Yuvraj?"
I've gone mad today.
Many girls came in my life and I forgot them.
But this one has impressed me.
Wow!
"Excuse me, Jaikishan!"
- Mr. Berry!
Senior sir has come from Delhi.
Hello!
"- Sir, he's Jaikishan!"
I had told you about him.
Oh!
Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.
"In a short time, you became a hero of our company."
I read your suggestions about Rajdoot motorcycle
I liked it.
- Thank you very much.
"So, mister."
"You got promotion, right?"
I never say anything wrong.
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
"Aunt, where's Radha?"
She has gone to visit a motorbike factory... ...with her Jimmy.

Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.
- Yun?
"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?
lf you come to the U.S.
Make sure you stop by Santa Monica beach!
Mr. Bookworm.
I'm not used to this.
Cut! okay!
It's over.

"My filming for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV is a wrap"
"The sunshine, the beach, the sand, everything in general was good"
None
Everything was wonderful.
I think the MV will come out well.
These shoes are too heavy I can't wear them.
"Ah, so heavy."
"Hey, seriously... stop that!"
You look scared for sure right now.
Take one hand off!
- I can't.
- It doesn't look good.
"Look here, kid."
You have to stand up straight.
Don't do that.
This is really dangerous. or you can do this.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
"Ah, my back."
Shall we go?
"Good, really good."
I think I can do it now.
That's a wrap!
Great job.
Great job.
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!
Sleep!
Shyamaprasad Shrivastava!

Hello!
Hello!

So..
Father.
Father.
You're fool.
"That's a nice kurta, Kishen."

We'll deal with you later.
"Bhikhu, let's go."
Mala.

Her love is so pure and I'm full of dirt.
A dirt!
"She thinks I'm Kishan and I'm Jackie, the don."
"In her eyes, I'm a police officer."
But actually I'm a criminal.
I'm her father's enemy.
I've kidnapped her.
"No, Goddess."
Don't test me in this way.
Punish me!
Punish me severely.
Kishan!
Kishan!
- That's not my name.
Didn't you hear me just now?
"Yes, I heard it."
I heard everything.
And I also saw what my density is.
Kishan!
"You love me a lot, right?"
"No, I don't love anyone. - you are lying."
"Your craving, your voice, your heart say that you love me."
Radha!

There it is again!
"Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Twilight:
Huh?
But I...WHAT?!

What could be DOOZlER than THAT?!
Pinkie Pie:
"Dunno, but if this wasn't it... (Twilight grumbles) (Twilight growls)"
Twilight:
"(resigned) Oh, I give up."
Spike:
"Give what up, Twi?"
Twilight:
The fight.
I can't fight it anymore.
"I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense."
"I don't see how it does, but it just does."
Just because I don't understand doesn't mean its not true.

2NE1- Falling in Love.
Ju:
"Even though I like ""Do you love me?"" and I listen to it a lot."
FlL has something different; it's more unforgettable than DYLM.
"So I love it, every time I listen to it I feel like I'm on the beach..."
I don't know ... it cheers me up.
Jana:
"I feel like Falling in love and touch me over here, touch over there."
Ju:
Exactly.
That's the feeling.
So 1st place Infinite- Destiny!
Ju:
"In our MV Reaction, when I saw the video and listen to this song, I..."
Jana:
Fell in love.
Ju:
I did.
"The only that listened from them were ""The Chaser"", that we like very much."
"""Be Mine"" and ""She's Back""."
"So after ""Destiny"" I'm listening to everything, watching variety shows with them."
Jana:
She became a stalker.
Ju:
Yes.
"I'm now 5% Inspirit, because I'm still a V.I.P , Shawol..."
Jana:
Is that for real?
Ju:
I said 5%!
A bit in my heart!
Jana:
Or was it Russ you really wanted?
30 seconds!
Where's Jessica?
"OK, OK."
I admit it.
"I was dishonest, selfish and wrong."
"Now, can I please just have my stories?"
"Jessica, you're on now."
But the stories!
No time to proof them.
I'll just have to trust you.
"Now, go, all right?"
"We're live, remember?"
"5, 4, 3, 2..."
"Hello, I'm Jessica Fakewiel..."
Wakefield... with the *Oracle On-Air News.*

"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Fire!
"Fire!"""
"Kinda defeats the purpose, right?"
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
"I didn't say ""Fire!"", I said ""Fuck!"""
Fuck!
Fuck-fire!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Ass!
You can say anything.
Shit!
Bitch!
Cunt!
Fuck!
Fart!
Fuck!
"Wow, I just shot down a duck by saying ""Fuck!"""
Next is the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker.
This thing is the biggest shit-biscuit I've ever seen.
"You stand on it, and supposedly, you rock back and forth, which controls the D-pad."
The modern-day equivalent would be the Wii Fit.
"The Roll &amp;amp; Rocker is supposed to be compatible with every game for the NES, but I find that it isn't compatible with any of 'em."
"Each game responds differently, but none of them work."
"Adventure Island keeps walking right,"
"Excitebike keeps going down,"
"Skate or Die goes in circles,"
"Kung Fu ducks to the right,"
"Metal Gear does nothing at all,"
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
"What do you mean, it can't?"
Then name me three philosophers.
What a joke!
You wouldn't even know them if I did...
"Jacques Lacan,"
"Gilles Deleuze, Claude Levi- Strauss."
Herbert Marcuse.
Miss Dewdrop.
You're so cool.
Even pretty and smart.
I want to go back to school again!
- It's awkward.
- I like it.
Wait.
Now what?
It's ridiculous.
We've just met.
You don't seem like the man I've been talking with.
Yes.
I'm that man.
Your first kiss in 8th grade.
"First sex with your husband, age 19."
In someone else's car.
After drinking two cups of soju.
What kind of a man remembers only those details?
That's what men are like.
I know that but...
I liked you because you seemed different.
I thought we'd talk a lot.
Again talk.
What talk!
You're driving me crazy.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
"And then, it just happened anyway."
Like it was completely out of my control.
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy?
"Hi, Caroline."
"I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond."
Can you help him?
I'm going to try.
Why?
Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else?
A beer?
"Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes."
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
"Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are."
Angry.
Oh.
Thanks for lunch.
"Yeah, sure."
"Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
"Yeah, that would be great."
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that?
My doctor.
She's a doctor?
Ooh.
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
How would you know that?
Because--
"Because we were gonna get married, that's how."
He ever talk about going back to Greece?
All the time.
It was just talk.
He never meant to go.
Think he could have killed him for the passport?
He's been running for two years.
That could change a man.
But why?
"Why the passport if he had the car and $8,000?"
( sighs ) This whole killing thing is hard to buy.
"From everything I can learn, they were friends."
Not no more.
They had a fight.
"Well, Gus found out"
I went into Johnny's room.
Johnny made me go.
"Oh, sure."
( dials phones )
Is this Gus' handwriting?
I wouldn't know.
Hello.
Who is this?
North Shore Clinic.
"Uh, this is the police."
"Will you check something for me, please?"
I'd like to know if you've given a smallpox vaccination to a Gus Priamos recently.
"Uh, Priamos."

Yes.
He's dancing so well.
I'll put an end to all this.
Shut down the shop and get the scooter.
- Yes.
Come on.
- Kanji.
- Yes.
Look after my shop for a month.
Why?
- I'm going on Haj.
I suggest that you get your shop fixed.. ..rather than going on a Haj.
God save me from devils.
Your shop will come crashing down even if anyone sneezes.
Let's go.
- Coming.
Feed them worth 10 rupees.
- Okay.
"Let's go, let's go."

You're the Emperor?
I'm the Emperor of Zhennan.
And you're his uncle?
He's told me that... he's worried about you being angry at him.
"So please don't beat him, okay?"
"Miss Mu is very honest, and interesting."
I was going to punish him with the cane.
"But since you've pleaded for him, then it's forgotten."
Yu.
Hurry and thank Miss Mu.
Yes.
"Thank you for your plea, Miss Mu."
Time for your family reunion?
Yes.
"Goodbye, your Highness."
"Mother, let me drink to you."
I can't drink.
And you know that.
"Mother, this calls for a celebration,"
"Come on, Miss Mu toast to you too."
"Come on, let's have a drink."
We're a family from now on.
"Baifeng, have a sip."
"""The woman has a red mole on her left wrist."
Water of Ganges.
"- Yes, yes."
"Oh, give me some."
Why is it so bitter?
Because the Ganges is polluted.
Oh!
"- Yes. "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
""" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
Apologise.
They were fasting.
Hello.
- We were fasting.
And you gave us alcohol.
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.
It's made from sugarcane.
"It fills you with energy, and makes you lightheaded."
- Rascal.
Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.
Abusing in the month of 'Shravan' (pious month).
See.
Truth sounds bitter than liquor.
There's a limit to cracking jokes.
"Papa, please."
"What you did yesterday, is a sin in mummy's view."
And mummy's fasting today to repent for it.
I want to know.
How can she repent for my sins by fasting?
"Sushila, it's like your phone's on charging.. ..and my battery's getting charged."
ls it Wi-fi?
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
Ksanka's got to go.
Ksanka.
Ksanka!
Get back into your girl's clothes.
You'll go to Zbruyevka.
Maybe she oughtn't to go alone?
Find out how many there are and how long they'll stay.
"You ferry her there and then back, Yashka."
Go to Aunt Darya's.
"Good luck to you, Joan of Arc!"
Why did he call you that Joan of Arch?
What does it mean?
Something like a psychologist.
He knows all sorts of bourgeois words.
Valerka told me they burned that Joan of Arc.
He probably just made it up.
- Ksanka.
- What?
I like you prettier in girl's clothes.
What things you say!
That's right.
What are you doing?
I won't let you go alone.
I'm going with you.
You want to give me away?
Don't argue.
Go back.
Ksanka!
Ksanka!
"Wait, Ksanka!"
What were Danka's orders?
It's not that.
So?
"I see. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Case on God admitted.
"Paper, paper, paper."
High Court has put it's seal on it.
Through the notice prepared by advocate Hanif Qureshi.. ..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case on God has been accepted.
I think he's mad.
Who is this guy?
"Hey Jigna, what happened?"
"See, his wife ran away."
Who can live with that madman?
I don't even talk to him.
Or the Lord might punish us as well.
What a splendid bike.
"- But, who is he?"
I think he arrived just last night.
Who's playing this classical music?
I've heard that the new guest is really handsome.
Don't I look handsome?
Get inside.
"Hey, Hari Prasad."
"Hey, Chaurasiya."
What's all this?
I was waking up the birds!
What?
Who?
I was waking up the birds!
Practice.
I was practising.
It's a good thing to do in the morning.
I should stay out of danger.
Run!
Who are you?
I am a lieutenant of the police!
"If you fear this sword, then move aside!"
"I mean, I'll attack you!"
Halt!
What's this?
Why are you here?
I was worried you'd be in danger!
That you'd be caught!
You'll be in danger if you're with me.
So go back!
What about you?
The police are everywhere!
What if they see a lady from a noble house involved with thieves?
I don't care.
Then do what you want.
I don't care.
Who hit me?
Damn it.
What do I do with you?
It's better for you to be a hostage than a thief.
- Move aside!
- Stand your ground!
Move aside.
"If she gets hurt, we'll all be in trouble."
Miss Eun Hye...?
- Follow him!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Miss Eun Hye...!
Miss Eun Hye!
Where?
Shigu Town.
So?
"Let him go, and I'll get the snakes out."
"Fine, let him go."
"Stop it, or my head will fall off."
Get the snake out.
Let him go first.
Go.
Hurry.
Now.
"Sikong Xuan, the snake has given birth to little snakes, if you kill me, they will remain in your body, for your whole life."
How about this?
"Let me go, and I'll summon a snake out everyday."
"Lingerh told me to find Xiang Yaocha, what's that?"
A person or a herb?
I have no idea.
"Old man,"
What's Xiang Yaocha?
What?
Xiang Yaocha?
You're looking for Xiang Yaocha?
That's right.
"Sorry, I don't know."
Ask someone else.
Wait.
Hand over your money.
I'll kill you if you make a sound.
"You can take everything you want, except this box."
I must bring this to Xiang Yaocha.
What?
You're a friend of Xiang Yaocha?
"Hairy is the word that's just, I just picture his forearms, and being like, where are you?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I don't mind that.
BETH HOYT:
"I could, I can French braid."
I'd love to try a fish tail braid on his arm.
That would be fashionable.
"OK, you guys."
We are minutes away from open comments.
Anything you've ever wanted to ask Julie or
"Ted, now is your chance."
Put them in the comments.
We'll be right back.
STEPHEN SElDEL:
Some people work at home.
Other people work at their office.
Matt does his business in the streets.
STEPHEN SElDEL:
Steve.
You're hired.
"Yeah, I need a sandwich."
MALE SPEAKER:
(SlNGlNG) McMayhem.
McMayhem.
"What, you didn't know?"
"Naw, he ain't playing."
MATT MCMANUS:
Yeah I'm here now.
"I'm setting up, I'm setting up the office."
I'm going to set up shop right here.
Perfect.
You're just my type.
They aren't like you.
Wasn't that Jae Hee?
"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
What is this?
"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
"Can you pass me a spoon, soul roll brother never would?"
"Lights up, please."
"Come on, now."
"Damn, directorio."
What it do?
You must be on them red devils.
Y'all know what a red devil is?
"I'm not going to tell you, either."
"But I know my uncle used to take them, then fall asleep at the light."
BETH HOYT:
All right.
"Hi, guy guys."
"Man, um, here, we, this is, need these props."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, thank you."
BETH HOYT:
"These aren't full, though."
"So you guys, what we're doing, we've got some [INAUDlBLE]."
I'll give you this one.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Cheers.
BETH HOYT:
Not that it matters if you have.
"OK, we're here with [INAUDlBLE] ""Real Housewives of New York City"" critic Julia Klausner, and rock star Ted Leo."
"Ted, have you ever watched ""Real Housewives?"""
TED LEO:
I have.
BETH HOYT:
"Oh, good."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You went to high--
"You went to high school with Camille Grammer, didn't you?"
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
- We're fine too.
"- I am fine, son."
- You lost weight.
"- Who, me?"
"No, I think it's just you."
I am as I should be.
- You not eating much?
- I am.
Your mommy brought a lot of nice food.
"I made karnı yarık, börek, mantı."
I made deserts.
You should definitely eat them.
Oh God you didn't have to.
"It is nothing, really."
But don't give all out.
Eat them yourself.
"- Thanks, will do."
- And I brought you cookies and stuff from the bakery.
I left them downstairs.
Eat them as well.
"- Okay, don't worry."
- Don't eat them with an empty stomach.
They might burn your tummy.
Don't listen to her.
You can eat them safely.
"Okay, don't argue at least here."
- Everyone alright?
"- They are, thanks to God."
- Güney says hello as well.
- Aleykum selam.
He wanted to come here so much.
But they let only me.
She can carry the whole show.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
*Missing school fund discovered.* *After a recent probe...*
"Now, there's our anchor."
"Hi, Russ."
(boy) Out of the way.
Quit shoving!
Editorial!
"Yes, the Patman does it again."
"What's it feel like to be a loser, Egg-wad?"
There's no justice!
"Yes, I got anchor!"
Yes!
I got the Fashion Forecast.
Taste finally arrives at Sweet Valley High.
(girl) I know.
She's gonna be great.
"(boy) Oh, well..."
*(boy #2)* OK...
"So, Russ, looks like we'll be working some long hours together."
It'll be my pleasure.
"Well, that's a start."
Jessica and Lila got on and I didn't?
There must be some mistake.
Maybe you should talk to Mr. Collins.
"OK, news team, come get your story assignments."
Go on.
I will.
Go get your assignment.
I'll be fine.
"You did an exceptional job, Jessica."
Go!
Father.
"Canglong, are you an animal?"
Lingerh.
Mother.
Shut up.
"If I get angry,"
I'll eat up all your hearts.
Canglong.
We're guests here.
How could you be so rude to Miss Zhong?
Down.
Wake up.
Where are we?
Caught by the Yellow Robe Man and brought here.
Right.
"You've sucked up the Red Python's blood, and you're endowed with ""Red Dragon Soul""."
Climb up and look around.
"Maybe you can break the top, and we can escape."
I'll try.
The cover is very strong.
I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
- I wish Mom would just stay sick.
My son wishes that I would just stay sick.
"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
Do you remember what he looked like?
About 35.
Dark.
Nice-looking.
"Uh, thanks."
Thanks very much.
A boat would be too slow.
Check out the airlines.
Right.
One of them has a booking for Gus Priamos.
Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.
We've got no pictures of Priamos.
You've got pictures of Kimble.
( dramatic theme playing )
I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.
What do you care?
"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."
And he's going to be late.
And you're on your way to Greece.
You're on your way to Greece.
Yeah.
But he thinks it's you.
"Hey, Johnny."
We're here.
"You know what to do, Gus."
You betcha.
( tense theme playing )
Because you are the future of Egypt
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
He will be safe with me
"He is Egypt, that is all I've ever lived for!"
And now he must live for you!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
ls Marc Antony alive?
"I do not know, my Queen"
But you have to flee the city
Octavius' army will be here within the hour!
No!
I will wait for my king
Your Majesty... there are documents that have to be destroyed...
Go!
Go!
Have you seen Caesarian?
Where is he?
Have you seen the child?
Where's the child?
Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!
Where's the boy?
"He's not here, by the blessings of lsis"
Not here?
What do you mean?
"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
That's not it!
Don't you know me?
In that extremely degraded place!
Ah!
I don't know.
I feel leery!
I feel leery!
Hey!
Doesn't my body smell?
Huh?
"Hey, Baek Go Dong!&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Try to smell it."
"Ah, hyung-nim!"
Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim
left for the practice room.
He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Donatacci?
TED LEO:
Yeah.
Donatacci.
That's right.
BETH HOYT:
"OK, you guys."
I've watched plenty myself.
"One thing I've learned, I mean, you guys can back me up on this is that bitches be crazy, right?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
In general.
BETH HOYT:
Yep.
"So we're going to play in general, Bitches Be Crazy."
"OK, I'm going to give you guys a quote from either ""Real"
"Housewives of New York City"" ""Girl, Interrupted,"" the"
Winona Ryder movie about women in an insane asylum.
You have to guess which crazy bitch said what.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
BETH HOYT:
"Julia and Ted, you use your paddle to show us which one you think the quote is from."
"And you get a point for each one you get correct, and you drinks for each one you get wrong."
I'm just going to be drinking throughout.
TED LEO:
OK.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
That makes me more comfortable.
BETH HOYT:
That's what we're looking for.
OK.
Type in a new card for Elizabeth.
"You got it. *the superintendent of schools,*"
*this money* *will now be redirected*
*to Sweet Valley High* *Activities Committee...*
Great.
"You're up next, Bruce."
(mutters) Bruce.
And that's all the news you need to know.
"Till next time, Sweet Valley."
"And now, with his... unique take on Sweet Valley,"
Bruce Patman.
"Thank you, Jess..."
"*I mean, Elizabeth.*"
Where's his card?
It's coming right up.
"*Hello, fellow Gladiators.*"
"*And as if you didn't know,* *I'm Bruce Patman,*"
*and this is* *the Patman perspective...*
(giggling)
I'm really sorry.
This has to be done.
What did Collins say?
I have to talk to the principal.
Can't say you don't deserve it.
"Hey, nice move back there."
You really got me.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?"
I'm impressed.
You're a nightmare.
*But I say there's nothing wrong* *with having money.* (Patty) Winston!
*I love the way money feels.* *I love the way money smells.*
I love what money does for me.
"-No, your ideas are always this unoriginal and half-baked."
-[scoffs]
"Well, you know what?"
I wasn't thinking of going with that idea anyway.
I was thinking that we should just--
"-Haunt people and, while they're distracted, just steal their money?"
-Stop it!
"Yes, let's just do that."
"-Sweet, high five!"
-Whoa!
[groans]
Ow!
"All right, Old Man Blumpkin's house."
"-Yeah, but be easy on the old guy, okay?"
You know he's got that heart condition.
[gun cocks]
-What are you two turds doing in my house?
-Old Man Blumpkin?
-How can you see us?
Only ghosts can see other ghosts.
"-Duh, a--hole."
I just died.
-Ohh.
"-Wait, what did you just say?"
-Ohh.
"-No, the thing before that."
-Only ghosts can see other ghosts?
-But then... that means...
-You don't remember... do you?
"Last week, when you were driving..."
-No.
-There was an accident.
"-(dispatcher) Uh, please say again."
-I said we have an orange with the hiccups.
-(dispatcher) Oh no!
You're screwed!
"[screams, dial tone]"
-Ugh.
"All right, I'm out of ideas."
-[whimpers]
"-Look, everybody."
The important thing right now is to just remain calm.
-[hiccup]
[all screaming]
"-No, no, no!"
Everybody just shut up!
We're not going to freak out.
-That's easy for [hiccup] you to say.
You don't have an exploding [hiccup] hippo in your tummy.
"-Dude, it's not a hippo."
-It's an exploding hippo.
"-Listen to me, Orange."
Do you want to get rid of your hiccups?
-Duh.
"-Then you have to do exactly what I tell you, okay?"
-Okay.
"-Okay, it's really simple."
All you have to do is take a deep breath and hold it for 30 seconds.
-Okay.
[inhales] -(Pear) What?
"No, that never works."
-[groans]
-I always heard you have to stand on your head and cross your eyes.
-Mmm!
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.
- I understood.
And I also want to see one more relative.
"Mr. Jackie, don't drink so much."
For God's sake.
Please.
Mr. Bharat?
You?!
"Come... come, sit, Mr. Bharat!"
Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
You tell me.
He family has abandoned him?
"I've had tried call them, but they denied knowing him."
Moon.
What?
"Hello, Ms.Lee."
Brother is looking for us.
I've got Mr Lee here.
Go ahead and I'll join you later.
See you arroud.
Ms Lee.
Where're you going?
School.
So this is the place.
"What's your old lady, cutie?"
She is out.
Really?
Come in and find out yourself.
Sure I will.
Look at you!
You should be in school!
Look at your nails!
You think you're madonna?
Where's your mom?
"She went play mabjong, I guess."
She has the money to play mabjong but not the money to pay what she owes us?
How much do we owe your bom?
A few thousand dollars are no big deal.
Just the inerest alone will cost you a lifetime to repay.
A few thousand will soon turn into tens of thousands... ...which will then became hundreds of thousands.
Here is 500 bucks.
"My father owed you $5,000."
"- And do you know how many ""Inochkins"" I've got?"
- 263.
Understand?
- I understand.
- Want some fruit punch?
- No.
- Dismissed.
"- Let's go, kids."
- Kids.
"- Hey, swimmer."
Swam one too many?
Too late now.
Here's your ticket.
- Got anyone at home?
- Grandma.
- She in good health?
- Uh-huh.
"- That's all right, then, she'll do."
Will you manage on your own?
I ain't got time to play nanny all day.
The milk will go sour.
"All right, let's say I get there."
Grandma doesn't know anything.
Probably singing some song.
She'll see me and say...
"""Kostya."
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something?"""
- Kostya.
"Did they kick you out of the camp or something? ...and then, of course, ""You'll be the death of me!"""
- You'll be the death of me!
"Yep, here we go."
"""Why did you kill your grandma?"""
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
It was a wonderful experiment until we burned the church down.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Fair enough.
OK.
Let's talk about collaboration.
"If you could work with anyone in the biz, who would it be?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I would love to work with Tina Fey.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Really?
Wow.
"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.
My goal is to fall unconscious six times and be a Robocop!
Ouch!
That really hurts!
A Robocop!
You're Robocop!
"Dad, Dal-rae's killing your son!"
Dal-rae?
"He deserved it, right?"
Of course.
Take her away Young-hoon!
Don't come back here again!
How can he be so filthy!
Audience:
Yes.
AB:
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:
April.
AB:
April what?
Audience:
17th.
I believe that was a Sunday.
"Can you confirm, Chris?"
Chris Anderson:
Yes.
AB:
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
I will talk to him.
My boss called you.
You rejected.
So he himself came here.
Why are you sitting without respect?
I am the person who beat your people.
It was not my mistake.
You called me.
I said I will come.. ..after dropping the boy at home.
They tried to hurt the boy.
I will kill.. ..the person who tries to hurt the boy.
Uncle!
"Look here, I am an elderly person advising you."
Obey my words and forget that girl.
Which girl?
- What was her name?
Shailaja.
Shailu!?
Why should I forget her?
Because my boss is loving her.
"Hey, You will not be in Warangal."
In that case I will stay in Karim Nagar.
"Tell me uncle, he is loving her but does she love him?"
Who needs that?
My boss loves her.
That is enough.
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.
I am loving her.
She loves me.
So she is mine.
I am an young guy asking you.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
Will you answer me?
Come on.
"Now, Cheyney, no more of that."
Wake up.
Stop.
"Come on, get up."
Frank Jordan?
Who the devil's Frank Jordan?
I'm Frank Jordan.
You empty-minded jerk.
What were you doing in the car with his wife and kid?
I'm the gardener.
The boy got hurt in the yard.
I was driving him to the doctor.
Calluses and dirt under the nails.
"Well, that's no millionaire, that's the hired help."
"Congratulations, you got us a real prize, didn't you?"
"Ah, what am I supposed to do?"
The kid was even hugging him.
The gardener.
That's terrific.
"What's he worth, Cheyney?"
"Five dollars, maybe 10?"
"Oh, don't."
Don't.
"Pryor, I wanted."
I wanted to make him sweat out every minute.
What'd you say your name was?
Frank.
"Not a bad looking guy, Frank."
Never mind how he looks.
How long you been with the Pryors?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
SPEAKER 18:
"Dude, we do lock our doors."
"Our house has been broken into a couple times by some people, mainly dudes."
SPEAKER 19:
I've taken self-defense classes.
SPEAKER 16:
"I know how to fight, so I'll kick some ass."

SPEAKER 23:

SPEAKER 24:
Have you ever felt like you're in danger of sexual violence?
SPEAKER 25:
"No, I haven't."
No.
SPEAKER 26:
"I mean, I've never really felt at risk."
SPEAKER 27:
Sexual violence?
"Well, I don't know."
It's not really something that I think about a whole lot.
SPEAKER 25:
It's not really something I think about that much.
SPEAKER 21:
"I mean, when you think of sexual violence, you usually think of a woman walking down a street at night."
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!

Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.

And there's the Empire.
Masood:
Hi.
This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
- Is Güney Bey here?
- No.
- Tell me when he is.
"- Yes, sir."
Has the vendor come?
"You bought some hair conditioner, too?"
"Okay okay, good."
I took my time when those two appointments were canceled.
Maybe I shouldn't come to the shop today if there's no customers.
"I'm home, yes."
You call me if you need me.
"Okay dear, kolay gelsin."
Why don't you take a break.
- Your coffee is getting cold.
"- I'm coming, abla."
There's a lot of ironing to do as well.
"We'll get all done, abla."
Don't worry.
"What is wrong, abla?"
- He's dead.
- Who?
"Which one, the one with the picture?"
Who is he?
Abla?
Someone you know?
"""Son of deceased Ibrahim and Hatice Gencerel..."""
"""... beloved father of Arda and Tuba..."""
"""... husband of Sevgi Gencerel."""
His funeral will be on this afternoon.
A relative?
"Abla, are you okay?"
To the funeral?
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #16:
"Keep it up, keep it up."
There we go.
Teenager #17:
Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
- Let's break up.
"-Why, Sook-hyun?"
-We've made it this far.
Just...
- This card is maxed out.
Find a better woman.
Can you put these back on the shelves?
Sook-hyun!
There's no better woman for me.
Don't do this...
Cut it out and get lost!
I'm sorry

Don't worry.
They said she's fine.
SMS from Lee Jin Woo
Meet me at the Sky Lounge today.
"Hello, Hello."
"Jin-woo, if you're off duty, then act like it."
Forget this and go start a fire in your girlfriend's heart
Okay?

The gap in performance at elementary schools is rising.
"Now, today's weather forecast."
"Due to the high atmospheric pressure from the southwest, the heat wave..."
What are you doing?
BETH HOYT:
I am demonstrating some different ways to sit.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
"Mom, don't die..."
"Mom, please don't!"
Mom...
Don't die!
I'll behave from now on.
Ms. Eom Ju-young?
I'm from a separation agency.
You know Park Hwi-chan?
I was sent by him.
"I was going to quit this work, but since he's my last client, I came especially for him."
Now...
I'll deliver the message from Mr. Park Hwi-chan.
"Hwi-chan doesn't want to separate from you, Ms. Eom."
This is an unusual case.
Hwi-chan wants you to stand up again.
Who?
Park Hwi-chan.
My son.
Yes...
Your son has one more thing to show you.
And that is...
Didn't he draw it well?
He said he couldn't draw you well before... because you are too pretty.
Are you okay?
"Hwi-chan says he'll do what you say, keep his diary, and won't tell lies anymore, so please..."
Tell my son...
Thank you... for drawing me... so well.
I will.
Mom...
Mom...
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Have a seat.
1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
"Reporter Han, search the portals more."
Reporter Song!

"If I don't give orders at the office, nothing works here."
Excuse me.

"I'm sorry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
What's this?
Is the broadcast still not over?
It looks like I have to leave even without saying bye.
"What time is the flight? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Announcement. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Boarding Korean Air TK009,  which was scheduled to leave at 13:50, will be delayed due to sudden problems with the plane."

What is this about Won Kang Hwi?
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
"What's this, dad?"
What's wrong dad?!
What's this letter?
This is an expulsion letter from school
You skip classes?
"Dad, that was when I was in 7th grade"
Oh
And that was a while ago?
You ditched school?
You failure!
Dad it was a very long time ago
No more allowance! and no more Belila (Egyptian food)
I don't like it
Help me Sameh

Anyway， you must pay
How much? $200，000?
No， make it $20，000
Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?
She's coming up
Miss， it's late.
Come some other day
You've put on my underpants
You must be crazy
Now I've got the proof
Take them off now
Okay
These are yours.
Take them back
ln fact， it was my fault
Why not?
That's because he's your younger brother.
You're my daughter.
I'm your real father.
Nonsense.
I don't believe this!
We have different surnames.
My child
"No matter what your surname is, you're indeed my daughter."
"I have a jade pendant here, it's the same as the one you're carrying."
They're the love tokens of your mother and l;
Take a look.
Mother.
Mother.
What's going on?
It's all because of your father.
Do you know that?
Miss Mu is your elder sister.
What are you doing?
Royal Uncle asked us to keep you under watch.
Yellow Robe Man...
Canglong.
Back off.
I'll deal with them on my own.
Move over.
Let me deal with him.
Moonlight Palm.
"If I jump, then there is nothing to worry about."
Catch her.
What are your wicked plans?
Senior.
Where are we taking them to?
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Thank you.
"Take it, man."
Take it.
It's my habit to help poor friends.
"Keep it, man."
"- No, thank you, sir."
Your size is smaller than mine.
As my chest is wider than you.
Neither my poverty nor your friendship can cover it.
Hey... this guy is self-made.
I like it.
Is this your bike?
"- Yes, it's mine."
Which model?

"It's a very good bike, sir."
A latest model of our company.
No 1 bike in India.
Indian bike!
Indian bike is a Indian bike!!
"Shit tank, shit tyre!"
And shit model!
"What nonsense is this, Jimmy?"
"Don't get angry, darling."
He's right.
Indian is Indian and foreign is foreign.
"Now see, this foreign metal."
It's very strong.
You can punch it anywhere.
Nothing will happen to it.
Hit it here or there...
Keep hitting... keep hitting anywhere.

Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.

Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!
- (high-pitched static) (muffled scream)
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."
D:
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.
No!
No!
Manuel!
No!
No!
Manuel!
Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
"So, it starts with level one, holding hands."
"Two, arms around waist."
"Three, good night kiss."
"Four, kiss lasting over three minutes without breath."
"- Five, open mouth kissing."
"- Number six, tongues."
"Oh, my God."
"Seven, upper body fondling outdoors."
Eight...
"Oh, my God."
I've gone all jelloid.
- Who are those fitties?
"- They're well beyond fit, they're lush."
They are sex gods.
- They must be newbies.
"- Ace Gang, it's boy-stalking time."
Ladies?
- They have mushy peas and chips.
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, definitely."
I want them!
You're here.
You're late.
Get changed.
We're going on a family outing.
- Do we have to?
"- What do you mean, do we have to?"
You used to love doing things with the family.
"Georgia, don't start, not tonight."
We're going to the Bonker's Buffet and your granddad's coming as well.
"Oh, look out."
"Oh, no."
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Did you think I was that stupid?
I knew you looked familiar!
I should have known then!
I knew that you knew me!
I'm really stupid.
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
"Was it you, Chief?"
Don't try to trick me again!
I know everything!
"Long time no see, Doe Eyes."
So it was you!
Have you become a bandit for the people?
- I guess you can say that.
- I'm so glad to see you!
You're amazing!
We should rush your marriage to In Hyung.
I'm not interested in it.
You do what you have to.
This marriage was never what I wanted anyway.
Alright then.
Go and rest.
How do I get rid of that little...!
- But you're hurt.
- I'm alright.
It's alright if it hurts.
Miss Eun Hye!
"I heard you were safe, but I still had to come."
- Are you hurt?
- Go back.
I will do everything in my power to catch the man who did this to you!
How?
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
Really?
"There're so many of us, we're not afraid of her sword."
Right...
Eat...
"They want to kill her, what now?"
"If she dies, then no one could save Miss Zhong."
Right.
"I'll send her a message first, then she won't kill me."
Waiter.
For the bill.
"""Shigu Town"""
This is it.
Anyone home?
"There're eight people coming to hassle you,"
I'm here to give you this message.
Anyone home?
You are...
"Don't be so sneaky, get in here!"
I have...
"I know that they're going to hassle you, that's why I rushed here."
But it's too late.
What's your name?
Tuan Yu.
Any last wishes?
You better tell me now.
"There's a young lady called Zhong Ling, she's trapped by the Poisonous Moths Clan... at Wuliang Hill, she sent me here for you."
"Don't waste anymore time, better go."
Get out!
I don't want to kill anyone today.
What are you talking about?
Go.
After her...
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.

His old man is a journo.
What's the fucking difference?
You let one of them get in with us.
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You shut the--
I don't care who he is or what he's done.
You don't do someone on the deck.
"What's fucking wrong with you, eh?"
"He'll bury us all and, what, you just gonna sit down and watch him do it?"
No.
"No, Steve, you're the Major."

This has got to stop.
Hush!
I shwear that girl looks like Her Grace.
Huh?
Is Sulhi in?
"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
Whoa.

BETH HOYT:
Tom might do it no hands style.
I feel like Tom would be like-- or something would happen.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"He would give you a reverse happy ending, remember?"
"He was like, oh, this masseuse, masseurs were like, accusing him of first of all, coining the term reverse happy ending."
"Which doesn't, it didn't exist until he came along with it."
TED LEO:
"I love imagining that in like, a Vinny Barbarino voice, that he'd be like, come on, man."
I'll jerk you off.
That's good.

"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.

"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."

He's gone.

"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I served four years instead of one.
I won't let you bully this boy.
It's not like everyone will experience what you did.
Right?
Don't talk!
Don't talk!
"Okay, stop it guys."
Don't stir up trouble.
"No need to make it a big deal, brother."
We're just joking around.
"It's okay, abi."
It isn't that important.
Don't be in bad terms with anybody because of me.
- You here for how long?
- One and a half year.
- Why?
- Homicide.
"A matter of honor, abi."
I killed the guy I saw with the girl I love.
May God save you.
"- Shall I enter, abi?"
Shall I?
"- Okay, come in."
"Okay goes, keep it up."
Where are you?
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Canım...
Welcome.
We have two hours before the meeting.
Come let's get away for a while.
- Burak was here.
"- What, why did he come?"
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
"You don't know, but I do."
I'd string up his dead body if I had my way.
"He was a bastard, that pa of yours."
"Here, drink."
Danka's a long time in coming.
Don't worry about him.
Valerka!
Valerka!
"Wait, Valerka!"
- Hear that shooting in the village?
- So what?
Could anything have happened to Danka?
"You're no psychologist, Yashka."
"They're shooting wild, without any aim."
Just to keep their spirits up.
"What kept you so long, Danka?"
What's wrong?
I hurt my back.
The Whites are in Zbruyevka.
- Many of them?
- Lots.
- Come for long?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you find out?
I couldn't stay there.
Lyuty recognized me.
- What do we do now?
- Go scouting.
I'll go.
There're 40 houses in Zbruyevka and not a single man or boy left.
"Some have joined the Reds, some the Whites."
If one of us boys went they'd quickly spy us.
I was so freaked out.
"(Finebros) So, do you know what that game was?"
No.
Skinny?
Slim?
"I mean, it said ""Slender"" in the front."
"- ""Slender."""
"- ""Slender."""
"""Slender."""
(Finebros) And how do you know about this game?
- I heard it on YouTube.
- On the Internet.
"Someone was, like, tweeting about it."
"(Finebros) So, have you ever played the game before?"
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
(giggles)
- No.
- No.
"No, and I resisted playing it till this day."
- Yeah.
- It's my third time playing it.
I have played it on my phone once and didn't sleep for two days.
(Finebros) And what is the purpose of the game?
To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.
"Sir, I came for visit."
"Hi Dal-rae, welcome!"
"Hey, what's up?"
This is Ji-hwan's dad.
"I'm MOON Young-hoon, Ji-hwan's classmate."
"Ah, so you're Young-hoon..."
"Sir, bought some soju and squid for you."
How many?
The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?
"No sir, not really."
You're cringing.

- I got stuff to do.
Did you go back to that night club?
The place where you did pole dancing.
No...
I would really like to watch you.
You lost your chance.
What if I insist...
What if I gave you presents?
Wouldn't you dance for me?
Just once?
Doesn't your wife wait for you at home?
Cemre left home.
We are divorcing.
"Besides, all her roads go to north (Kuzey)."
- Where are we going?
- To my house.
Okay...
"Hüseyin Bey, sorry for the trouble."
"I could come and get it, you didn't have to Huseyin Amca."
I was kinda worried about you.
Since I didn't see you at the shop today.
- Hoped you didn't get sick or something.
"- No, no."
Not sick or anything.
I just didn't feel like going to work.
So I took a day off.
Why don't you come in?
Let me offer you a coffee.
"Thank you but, I shouldn't."
Zeynep will be home soon.
She works too much these days.
She gets tired.
"And now, I will alone shut down all his shops.. ..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta."
And this isn't my concern for you.
It's a direct warning.
Yes.
"You're safe here, it's a government property."
But how will you escape them?
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Sir.
The case has been accepted.
I'm worried about Sushila and the children.
"I'll take a cab, you go."
But how can I leave you alone.
"I'm going to the police station, for protection."
Drop her home as well.
Go.
"Be careful, dear."
"Go, go, go."
Are the boys ready?
Remember.
Kanji shouldn't get to see daylight.
That's it.
There he is.
"Catch him, beat him."
Don't let him go.
"Wait, where are you running to?"
He's hiding there.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
I shouldn't have lent the room to...

"- Sir, Pasha murdered two men and escaped."
What?
Pasha!
- Pasha escaped?
Joseph!
"- Yes, man."
Don't worry.
We've come to receive you.
Now you'll reach Mr. Daver in Singapore.
Your fake passport is ready.
"I'd suggest, it's not good to delay Radha's marriage now."
But there should be a nice match for her.
What about Mr. Prem Prakash's son?
He's little close in our relations.
But the boy is really nice.
"Even if we keep refusing the alliances, Jackie... ...will not come out of the jail for 2 years."
And it's difficult for us to let Radha... ...remain unmarried for 2 more years.
Its an absolutely lost case.
Gone.
"Oh, yes."
I forgot.
Your old friend has sent a letter.
From Singapore.
- Singapore?
He's Mr. Jimmy Thapa.
"Oh, Jimmy!"
He was my college friend.
Last year he was stuck with some custom problem... ...and I had helped him solve it.
It's a million-horsepower engine
Mighty Atom
"Listen carefully, la-la-la"
Open your eyes wide

Mighty Atom
Don't miss that elephant.
Gotcha!
My!
It's coming here!
"Hey,this is a real elephant."
Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?
"Wh, what are you!"
I'm Atom.
Stop it!
"You are a robot, right?"
Hey!
Come here.
The Little Elephant Pura
"- Yes, sir. keep my luggage inside."
"Daddy, I am so sorry I am late."
You are always late!
"Have a seat, dear!"
"Mr. Rajesh, meet my daughter seema."
I have already met her in a pleasurable way.
l..
I am still ashamed for that.
You are embarrassing me by saying this.
Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
Great!
Have this.
- Thank you!
Not so much!
Enough!
- Have some more!
You too have some.
My plate is already full.
I will take.
But you are not eating at all.
I am eating it.
"Enough, seema!"
- Please!
Thank you!
You too have some!
"- No. lt""s okay."
"Look, don""t feel shy. otherwise I will think that you are still angry with me."
You are giving me so much food.
I will have to go to the hospital from here.
"lf such a situation arises, then I will be your nurse."
You can surely kill me.
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
They're Granddad's teeth.
Granddad's teeth.
"So, the sex gods are twins."
- C'est magnifique.
- Marvy.
- But they're not identical.
"- Obviously, Jas."
They're two years above us.
Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.
London!
I knew they were cosmopolitan.
Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.
You lot are so sweet.
I got mostly eights for everything.
"- So did I. - Me, too."
"Hey, who gave me a four for my nose?"
And look.
"Yep, and now they'll do speeches."
"""When he was a little boy..."""
"- When I was a little boy... ...he, of course, ""also had a grandma."" - ...I also had a grandma."
"And in his whole life ""he couldn't, and I could."""
"- But in my whole life, I could not manage to disappoint her to death."
But he could!
"And thus, Kostya Inochkin began his clandestine life."
"- Hey, Nelya."
Do you know how to dance Charleston?
- All girls here can.
- Can you show me?
- All right.
- Can you teach me?
"I can teach you something, too."
- Want me to teach you telepathy?
- What now?
"- You know, make people do stuff with your mind."
"- Kosmos, Kosmos!"
Come here!
- Try to make him do stuff.
- Easy.
Like what?
"- I don't know, something."
- Hang on.
- Dolt.
"- I swear, that wasn't me."
He did that on his own.
- There's something in there!
- Smells like a wolf.
Or a badger.
- Have you ever smelled a badger?
- A hundred times!
- Do you have an superstitions like that?
- No.
"- So it's fine, then?"
- Yes.
It's fine.
"I'm here, abi."
Cross the ball!
Pass the ball!
Fuck your mother!
Told you to pass the ball.
Don't swear at my mom!
- Get out!
You're not playing.
- No.
You're opposing me?
Fuck off.
Take that back.
Take that back.
"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.
Master!
Said you gotta do both.
A National is only two weeks away and you're 3 kg over.
Pick up the speed!
Another weight loss?
Don't get me started.
Go get me some water.
Ji-hwan...
"You're losing weight to avoid facing Young-hoon, right?"
Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.
Gave me one cigarette.
"Sir, cigarette."
"Hey, why are you thundering like that?"
Could you not remember me all these days?
"Anyway, now that you came, stay here for some time."
The both of us can play together.
[laughs]
-[groans]
"-Oh, my God."
"Orange, your hiccups!"
-What about them?
-They're gone!
"-Wow, gorilla must've scared them away."
-Yay!
-Yay!
-Yay!
Whoo-hoo!
-Now that's what I call a close-- [hiccup]
"Oh, crap."
-Sounds like a like a Hungry Hungry Hippo-- [laughs]
[laughter]
-(director) Cut.
"All right, guys."
-I'm sorry.
He started laughing and--
-I can't help it.
It sounds so funny when you hiccup.
-[clears throat]
"From the top, from the top, here we go."
-(director) Action!
-It's [hiccup] not...
So let me tell you what cutting edge astronomy looked like not so long ago.
It looked like this.
"First of all, that's just a sketch."
"Somebody stood at a telescope from night after night, incidentally wearing a top hat, sketching what they could see."
"And secondly, they're looking at a single object."
"In this case, it's what was known as a spiral nebula."
An island universe.
If you can't trust your wife that much then go live happily by yourself.
What do you mean who?
"It's my friend, Misook."
Here check for yourself.
Hear that?
Bye!
Oh my god.
It flipped over.
"Uh, What happened?"
How old is your kid?!
- Eight!
- How old?!
First grade?
-You met him through the Internet.?
- He was closer than my husband...
I wasn't sure who my real husband was.
I'd get so confused...
You lived in a total illusion.
"Anyhow, love is an illusion!"
"You liked him so much that he felt burdened, right?"
Or Are you...maybe a perv?
Do you like to hit?
Or like to be hit?
Maybe to be bounded?
"- Um, isn't that the College guy?"
"- Uh, it is..."
Hey!
Hey!
College Student!
Are you just gonna ignore us?
Why would I ignore you?
I'm so tired I can't even see.
"Ah, semi-retired."
"You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
One can never be...
Too careful.
"Oh, um, hey, um."
Sorry.
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna go."
"Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
"Elena, I am..."
I'm sorry.
"Please, it... it's ok."
"Ah, it's not ok, Elena."
"I mean, this is not even my place."
It's... it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family...
It's your family's place.
"The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too."
"We needed you, and..."
And you stayed.
Sp thank you for that.
Maniac.
"I want to see whoever is responsible for the maintenance of this elevator, in my room."
And call the firm and tell them about this scandal.
Güney Bey has a guest.
Simay Canay.
He is mentally challenged.
He's obsessed.
You heard him.
How he threatened me.
He is very determined to get me in trouble.
Güney Bey...
You have a guest waiting at the reception.
- Simay Canay...
- No way.
Tell them to send her away.
How many times I have to tell you not to let that woman in this building?
You still asking?
He doesn't want to see her.
Güney Bey isn't in the company.
His car is here though.
This is what they told me.
I was going to give him something that belongs to him.
"Anyway, as he wishes."
Simay.
Do you have time?
"Mom, I'm home."
Welcome.
The house is smelling wonderful.
Mom?
"What happened, are you okay?"
- Did something happen?
- No.
I'm a guy from Busan.
I'm doing as I please.
"Then someday, won't Ha Ni realize the potential Bong Joon Gu has?"
When are the So Pal Bak noodles coming out?
Oh!
Hi!
Did you get home safely?
Yesterday?
"Ah yes, of course!"
I did get home safely.
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.
"But, it seems like you did worry about me."
"Anyways, it was fun."
It was like we were shooting a movie.
"""Gangsters and Hae Rin"""
I'm glad that you got home safely.
Let's go inside.
Look at this.
"Wonderful perfection, a goddess."
You sure did take a lot of pictures.
"Wow, look at this."
"She looks pretty, right?"
"So, what happened yesterday?"
"You did have a date, right?"
What date?
We just ate and left right after.
"Ah, I should have paid for the food."
"Ah, what is that?!"
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!
You should have confessed.
Confession...
I did plan on doing it.
Why are you doing this?
Damn it!...
Damn it!...Damn it!
Damn ..
"Dalyan, I don't know how my son is."
Maybe he's dying.
I have to look into Mahir's eyes and ask for forgiveness...
Don't deprive me of this!
Don't deprive me of this!
"Thank you, my brother."
Come on.
Now stab me...
Then go to bed.
They will find me alone. as i don't want to bring any trouble to you.
"Hello, Kemal."
Why didn't you tell me that Mahir got shot?
I called you but you weren't there.
And how is he now?
"He's in the hospital, unconscious."
Who did it?
Did they arrest anyone?
No Abi.
No one got arrested.
"Ok, Ok."
Look Kibrit.
How much do you make out of rooster fights?
Is it enough?
I always find a way to make money.
"I should find a new way for you to make money, Kibrit."
You're right.
But all the ways are taken.
It's a heavy traffic.
"Hey, Gypsy, you can't hold anything but a guitar."
Going to take it into battle with you?
His horse will wield the sword for him.
Ajugful of vodka for me!
"Come on, son."
"Here, hold my hands, guys."
"Hold his hands, come on."
I'll not have you breaking my cups!
"Away, you anti-Christ!"
Vodka!
Quick!
Give me another one!
"Come here, Ksanka."
"Good day to you, Uncle Sidor."
- Do the men bother you?
"- Oh, not at all."
Poor orphan.
I've brought you a present.
- You like it?
- It's lovely.
"- Wear it, if you like it."
- Thanks very much.
Go now.
- Anybody been to see her?
- Not a soul.
- Did she go out?
- No.
"If anything happens, I'll skin you alive."
She makes out to be innocent.
But I know she's connected with them.
They'll show up any day now.
"You see anything suspicious, let me know."
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."
- Go on read it.
- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."
"Please, if you wand to get well, my dear."
I am sorry.
I know I upset you so much.
I am sorry.
"- It's okay, canım."
- I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay.
Okay.
Barış did what is expected from him.
"When he felt cornered, he pulled a victim out of his hat."
- How did you know I'd be here?
- Your assistant told me.
"Melda, we need to talk."
Make him drink

Paul， you smell it
Well， no smell?

Landal's hair is a wig
Right

Lisa， what secret has he got?
No， this is all I know
Lisa， I didn't want to tell you
When I was a child.
I saw a bitch die， survived by a puppy
I pitied him and lifted him up
He was so hungry he bit off my teat abruptly
The left one is artificial
And you?
The right one， not the left
Wrong， the left side

"Harun said I had to go, but I am not going."
You... ...only thought of us...
"It is enough, my daughter..."
There is nothing left to do for your father..
We have to wait for the hearing...
"Look, my darling."
There are people who can take care of us here..
Don't think of us.
Think of yourself from now on
Your husband. ..it is not good to leave him alone.
- Go - I won't go..
What are you are going to do?
Narin..
Narin...
Narin???
"You went to Serdar, didn't you Narin??"
I know you went to Serdar!
"You won't sit at home, waiting for me!"
"What is there that you can't find here, I don't know!!!"
Good evening.
- Welcome...
- Thank you
Hello?
"Where are you, Narin?"
It is late.
I should go.
Let me drop you off.
"No, don't trouble yourself."
I can go by myself.
It is late.
It won't do to go by yourself this late.
"Go, my daughter."
"President, the ticket is ready."
Call Kang Hwi immediately!
He is in the practice room now.
President!!
"Did you see, President?"
"That is called Hapki Dance, isn't it good?"
Sit down.
"Ah, yes."
"As I was sleeping yesterday, I suddenly had an inspiration!"
"So, I came early because I wanted to complete the choreography."
I could make it big like this as a choreographer.
What is this?
Go and rest for a few days.
Why suddenly?
Did we get a schedule?
Ah!
Did we get a commercial?
What is all this?!
That is what I want to ask you!
Hey!
What is all this?
Why would I with this greasy guy?
What?
"You don't think that I really did this, do you?"
"President, don't you know me?"
I know.
You would never do something like this.
Exactly.
What is this?
It's that place!
You know?
"I know, but..."
"I am Baek Sung Jo, Baek Sung Jo."
"At a time when she's not even thinking, when she bites her tongue..."
That's when it's easy to get them to fall for you!
When she bites her tongue.
"Hey, Hey!"
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?
This is practice.
Practice?
The timing is important.
Look at this.
If the girl says
"""What is this?"
"What are you doing?!"" then you put your hands like this"
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" and just go in for the kiss."
Hey!
"You have talent, it's very real."
- Really?
"- Wow, so if the girls say ""What are you doing?"""
"Then, slam..."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me"""
Wait!
"Here, the timing is important."
When the girl lifts her head like this...
"Then,"
When she lifts her head...
"""Why?"
"What are you doing?"""
"Slam.  "" Try to forget me if you can."""
That's right.
That's it!
"You're a bad man with no chance, you can't even touch me"

But today I am seeing a fashionable thief!
That too shoes thief!
"Ma""am, talk respectfully!"
"Maybe you don""t know who I am!"
You talk politely!

I can't believe that I made this?
The way it has landed I am completely sure you've made it.
What did you say?
- That's why professor.. ..only you can tell me how I can go back.
But why did you come here?
You mean to say.. ..you came here to make your parents fall in love.
What a rotten idea.
It's a stupid idea.

Tony?
Tl:
"Elegant, sensual, beautiful."
"Can be a bit better technically, but a really good start of the season."
D:
Wow!
How about Ann?
AW:
I don't have much to add.
"It was very beautiful and the song was called ""Natural Woman"" and I thought that you really was one."
D:
So lovely
D:
"The jury agreed, Camilla, and what do you think the policeman over there think?"
CL:
"He thinks that everything I do is fantastic, so he just got another confirmation now."
D:
Do you know what I believe?
I think that the cop thought it was touching.
D:
Thanks to the jury.
Thank you so much Camilla and Kristjan.
J:
"Camilla, this is almost like a dream."
What great praise you got from the jury.
CL:
I was very tearful.
J:
Is that true?
CL:
"It's so much energy that has been used now for many weeks, and finally it went my way."
J:
Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...
Let's do it later.
Let's just talk now.
- About what?
-What painters do you like?
- There.
Have you buried the gold here?
"You will be buried here, sheikh."
Why was the bullet fired?
I think something is fishy!
Remember.. in front of me you had killed my mother.
"I won""t spare you, sheikh!"
"I won""t spare you!"
As per our information lran lnterpol had raided the place. sheikh Padar was killed.
And Tiger singh fled.
"lnformer Yasmin is in lran police""s custody."
Yasmin says that Tiger will surely go to Alaska to meet shebiro.
Hello.
All planes follow Alaska safari N8108 Yankee.
I repeat.
All planes follow Alaska safari N8108 Yankee. over!
"Yasmin, what is this?"
Why was sheikh killed?
"Now it""s your turn."
How dare he!
I will finish him!
Where is the gold?
Gold?
- Gold!
He has the gold.
We will equally share the gold.
Now Tiger is going to come.
Take this.
"Lipstick bomb. open this, apply it and then close it."
Then put it in his pocket.
"He will die after one minute. okay, boss."
Hello!
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.
"Neither I can move about freely, nor can I sing."
And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
Om!
Om!
Om!
Mother!
Mother!
"What happened, mother?"
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
- Shanta!
God!
Take care of my Kishan after my death.
"Don't say that, Shanta."
Today I'll bring all your medicines.
Today...
Are you serious?
(nervously) Wait.
"No, no!"
"No, no, please, please, no!"
No... (speaks indistinctly)
"I don't know how to play, no."
(hyperventilates)
"Oh, my God."
I'm so scared.
"I don't know how it even starts yet and I'm already scared, man."
"This reminds me of ""The Hunger Games."""
"I'm gonna, like, get eaten by one of those dogs."
I don't even know where to go.
(chuckling) Where am I going?
Am I going the right way?
This kind of reminds me of my home.
"I live, like, deep in the forest."
"(singsong) Come out, come out, wherever you are."
I feel like I'm actually in the dark.
This isn't as scary as I thought.
What is that?
No.
"Okay, never mind."
I'm shaking.
(chuckles nervously)
Is that the wind?
Is that the wind that I hear?
I think that's the wind.
I don't want to go in this building.
I really don't.
- (footsteps) - There we go.
There's a page.
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.
Sit over here.
"Stop playing around, dad."
Wait a sec Young-hoon.
Will be with you shortly.
"Thought you were hurt, look well to me."
My sincere apology for being well.
Are these even washed?
Should've never come here!
"Well, Ji-hwan says you will wash them again, for sure and told me to soak them and hang."
And those... socks need to be sewed.
I'll let you pass just for today.
Are these rags or socks?
Shit!
I guess you're a writer.
Yeah.
A novel.
"Oh, I see."
Why do you look at me like that?
Do I look that handsome to you?
"Yes, you're handsome."
Kissing my ass?
So young yet corrupted already!
Um...
Did you want to tell me something?
Have a seat.
Okay.
I consider Dal-rae like a daughter
How long have you been a couple?
It's been about three months.
You two can't be serious then.
Huh?
Are you close to Ji-hwan?

Jack:
"Today is Saturday, the 24th of July."
"For the last three years, I've been away from home to do my degree."
"And as soon as that finished,"
I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.
So I don't really get to see my old man that much.
"But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up."
man:
I just phoned you.
Jack:
"Yeah, I just got it, actually."
I was about to phone you back. man:

All right?
Jack:
"Yeah, not bad. man:"
Mouthful?
Jack:

That tire's fucked.
Jack:
I haven't had time. man:
That tire's fucked.
You'll get done for that.
Again you taunted me!
Duty is duty!
Duty.. what must be your duty in this small town?
"Friend, this is a small town."
But many activities are carried out here!
I will explain to you when l am free.
I will leave now.
"Listen.. don""t forget your friend for the sake of your duty!"
"All the best! - see you! sir, he is chief lnspector of customs."

Pleasure is mine.

"You've won, Cleopatra"
"Really, Jess, you should find a better class of guy, someone like Todd."
"He's dependable, trustworthy, loyal..."
That's not a boyfriend.
That's a Boy Scout.
News show?
"What's the scoop, Mr. Collins?"
The school's installing a new in-class video system.
"As of next week, Oracle goes broadcast."
Cool.
Lame.
What a great opportunity.
I'm signing up now.
Hello.
Can I help you?
You already have.
Russ Franklin.
I'm the video consultant for the news show.
"Oh, you're working on this?"
Mm-hmm.
"Jessica Wakefield,"
Sweet Valley's next news anchor.
Mind if I check out some of your... equipment?
"Film major at Valley College, huh?"
Creative men really turn me on.
Must be a really tough program.
"Yeah, it's... murder."
We have to watch five movies a day.
They actually expect us to pay attention.
Brutal.
This is the nerve center of our operation.
From here I can hook in and put your face in every classroom in the school.
Really?
"- Quick, everyone, hurry!"
Put them on!
- Whose slippers are these?
- Mine!
"- Hey, who's missing?"
- How should I know?
- He got away.
- Lost one.
- Inochkin!
- All together!
- Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
- Inochkin!
And that's me.
That's my name -- Kostya Inochkin.
I ran away with the locals to the island.
I'm a very good swimmer.
- You don't believe me?
"All right, one moment."
I can swim across this river a hundred thousand times over!
"I'll have you know, I do 2:12 on the back."
"If I was a woman, I would be a state champion in women's swimming."
- When I was a little boy...
"I, too, spent summers in camps."
We had it tough back then.
Had to sleep in makeshift shelters...
Cook on open fire.
Had to fetch our own water.
And do our own laundry.
"In other words, none of the comforts of life whatsoever."
And now?
Look around.
Tha-Tha-Tha-- That would be-- That would be great sometime.
- How about tomorrow ?
"- Well, I have ballet practice."
Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards ?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it ?
"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
"Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you."
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.
Fuck me !
There's gonna be an Eastern European chick naked in your house.
And you're not gonna do anything about that ?
Fish contains all the vitamins!
Eat this and your face will glow like gold!
"Mama and saridon""s health is not fine. so I got fish!"
How is that possible!

Take your fish and leave!
"- He won""t leave!"
He will leave!

Gold!

"DDT, you crook!"
You have made a big blunder!
Why are you yelling?
"I didn""t do anything!"
Your husband made a blunder!
Yes!
You idiot!
"Had you not asked for dowry, we wouldn""t have got in this mess!"
You fool!
You took the dowry!
You took it!
"We need gum, fast."
You can't beat a breathalyzer with gum.
You've been drinking all NlGHT.
Now it's a chase!
BASS
He upgraded the hyperdrive and the stereophonic sound system.
"We outran the space cops, and made them eat bass."
"Yes, I could feel it."
What is he called?
R2D2 your highness.
"Thank you, magic trash can."
You told me there's a bar here.
Yeah my bad.
Panaka.
"Yeah, the pizza's here."
Be right there.
I'm afraid I can't kick in.
I'll have to owe you.
"Whatever, man."
Why do you awaken me without skin?
What of our bargain?
You promised me flesh!
Raw nerves exposed to the world!
Every step is a new nightmare!
All I feel is pain!
You!
Why would they do this to me?
You want me to feel the pain?
"Yes, you want me to understand it."
So that I may show others.
Huzzah!
Excelsior!
- Right.
No.
- It's not a game.
What you want is you want a partner to return the ball.
- Do you want a partner ?
- Yeah.
"Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner."
- You do want a partner ?
"- Oh, I want a partner."
- Want a partner.
Good.
Good.
- Of course.
Good.
"So, once Hal becomes king, he has to take on... the responsibilities of leadership and turn his back... on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff."
"You see, Hal is going through a... rite of passage, much like you all are."
So make most of the time you've got left together.
You'll miss it later.

"- So, does your tongue cramp up ?"
- Nah.
"You get kind of dizzy, though."
- Wow.
That's amazing.
She's probably gonna want to do it soon.

Class dismissed.
"Still questing after the Holy Grail, huh, guys ?"
"Hey, uh, where's Finch ?"
"- Oh, he went home to take a shit."
- [ Chuckles ]
Fine.
I feel all right.
( ferry whistle blows )
We're gonna have to get rid of the car.
We can take that ferry.
You'll have to walk a little.
"I can't, Johnny."
Come on.
"I'll help you, Gus."
I can't.
I will only hold you back.
"You gotta go alone, Johnny."
You got to.
I'll stay here.
I'll make it.
I'll send you a postcard.
( tense theme playing )
"I'm not gonna leave you like this, Gus."
Go.
"Go on, Johnny."
Run.
"Go on, run."
SUNDAY DOCUMENTARY
ROSLlNG'S WORLD
"I slept in the kids' room, or rather, the grandkids' room."
That way I won't wake Agneta.
As usual we were...
When I left Stockholm we weren't done with the presentation.
At midnight I downloaded the final version.
It's only four AM and the paper has already come.
There...
"When you hold a lecture, you need to make sure you're up on the news."
"Better than me, better than its dad, better than both of us together."
"Please, let it be a girl..."
Why am I acting this way?
Am I a pervert?
"Good night, Princess."
How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.
I also have...
"I have a worry, too."
But don't...
Don't tell your sister.
Your sister...
Here... flowers...
She wants me to propose like this.
Why'd she hit me?
Not enough money?

2307.5 times one... is just that!
2307.5 times one!
Ah.. is there anyone here? heeeeeelp!
"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.
10.
- 13.
10.
- 11.
"10, that's it."

A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
"Hey, a daughter wants to talk to her dead mother."
- She is just being a good daughter.
- It's her business.
"If this makes everyone uncomfortable, I'll go there by myself."
- You'll walk there yourself.
Good idea.
- Add.
This is too much.
Do you have a heart?
"Hey, if you don't want to go with me, Get out of the truck."
What did you just say?
Read my lips.
I won't go.
I'm not going either.
"Ood, Add, where are you going?"
Come back now.
I won't.
What is this?
I'm not going.
"Since you have picked us up and raised us, you never did this to me."
Who is she?
You've just met her.
She's a liar.
Why are you serious with a whore?
What the...
Don't ever say that again.
I don't want to cause any more troubles.
I'll go.
Hold on.
"Shut up, you two."
Don't ever talk to my woman like that.
I don't like it.
I go to my post abroad tomorrow.
It's for a year.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's meet and talk.
- Let's talk later.
I'm busy.
"-Wait, don't hang up."
- Wait...
-What do you want?
I'm sorry.
Call me later?
Here.
30 dollars.
Have you had lunch?
"If you haven't, would you like to eat together?"
"I'll treat, to thank you for everything."
You look like a young miss.
Isn't that your guy?
Bastard.
He told me he was away on business.
Where are you going?
"You can't be too happy right now, let's go for some fresh air?"
I don't understand guys like him.
Definitely not my type.
What's with the sunglasses?
They don't even suit you.
-Wait here.
I'll be back right away.. - I thought you were buying me lunch.
- Oh...
I didn't recognize you.
Hello.
- Don't pretend to know her!
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
He has a muffler round his neck and wore kurta pyjama.
Its all right.
I will search.
Did you see a person in kurta pyjama and a muffler.
No sir.
See the other side.
You dont worry.
I am asking.
Look that side.
"Sir, please wait sir."
Dad!
Are you here?
"No, I am under the train."
Come on.
"Listen, my father is has boarded the train."
"Wait madam, I am searching."
I am saying that my father is has boarded the train.
I said I am searching.
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.
What?
He is in the train?
Come soon.
"O rain, do not go away after dropping on the eyes."
Stay with me always just like the showers and lightning.
Why did you go away having roused the feeling of love?
If you want to come will I stop you?
Why are you standing here?
He could not catch the train.
What can you do about it?
Come on.
"How is your health, father?"
You took a lot of risk for us till now.
You just go.
How can we leave you like that?
"Yes, we will also come with you."
You go from here.
- Listen to me.
They have entered the forest.
We got a message from Kasi.
He said that he will kill that man and .. .. bring the girl before the hour of marriage.
He said he will not be your brother if he fails.
"Uncle, make me as bridegroom."
He kept the ring I gave to him.
That means father lied to me.
And I believed his words.
I did a big mistake.
Come on.
Move away.
Do you want to die?
What do you want?
- I want a lift.
This bus belongs to a marriage party.
You will not get the lift.
"This is your bus brother, come inside."
Why dont you pick up the cell?
- It is your cell phone.
What?
My phone?
Hello?
Who is it?
I am unable to listen.
"Tayaru, is that you?"
We are coming.
He calls himself God.
I can see him.
He can see you.
"My name's Krishna, your new neighbour."
Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.
- Advice.
Anyone who thinks of me.
Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.
But...l always get there on time.
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
I want to go somewhere quiet.
What about you?
What's wrong?
No.
It's just... a bit uncomfortable.
Is it very discomforting?
"The world seems strange, doesn't it?"
Don't worry.
No one knows.
Let's go some place far.
It's so strange.
I don't think I'll ever come to a place like this again.
My heart is racing like a fish's.
"My heart's beating like a goldfish's, too."
Are we really going to do this?
"We don't even have any protection, do we?"
Condoms?
We come all the way here and don't do it?
Okay.
I'll go get some.
This place is not bad.
"Look at you, getting nervous."
Your face is burning.
I'm not nervous.
Wow!
You're really sensitive.
I am a little.
I like sensitive women.
Hey!
That tickles!
Don't!
I'm gonna start from the toe.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
"No, shame on you..."
For you raised that demon.
Shame on you.
How's your foot?
Is it swollen?
I see you wrapped it.
But heat won't do good if it's sprained.
Let's go see a doctor before it gets worse.
Don't be stubborn.
We can have breakfast too.
And buy you some clothes.
That's enough...
That's all we wanted to say.
It's up to you now.
Isn't she his sister?
Hoşgeldin.
- What's going on?
"- Nothing, come on inside."
It's something that can't be forgotten.
Let everyone know that.
He should never come back to town again.
- Is he talking about Kerim?
- Never mind him.
You heard me Galip Usta?
He better not come back just because his abla is here.
Or he'll have his answer from the town folks.
What's this?
What are you trying to do?
"Meryem Hanım, let's go inside."
"It's Reşat Yaşaran who is making you do this, isn't he?"
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.
"Ever since Sylvester picked up those two letters, ...bad things take place one after the other."
Weird things that no one can explain!
They just happen...
Click!
Just like that.
Sylvester
"Moon, it's your pager."
"I've dehited $3,000 into your account."
"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!
I don't live here!
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?

- Show- off.
I'll just get a job probably.
As if someone would hire you!
"You really sucked at high school, didn't you?"
"If you didn't study in high school, you should at least study at college."
Going after housewives!
And what kind of name is that for a chat room?
"""Welcoming Dumpy Housewives"" Weird taste!"
Miss Dewdrop.
I think I'm just going to go home.
Why?
To go study?
No.
You're disrespecting me and I can't stand it.
Let's eat first.
Fine!
Okay.
But we're only eating.
"Well, of course."
What else can we do with that thing...
Total mental castration...
My thing is fine.
"- Hey, why are you getting in?"
- Huh?
I have to go somewhere.
Take a taxi or walk.
There' no taxi here.
That's your problem.
Close the door!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
I was just kidding.. Get in.
Please help us!
Help us!
I don't want to die!
Stop!
"Young Master, why are you here again?"
"It will make things difficult for us, if it's said that such a thing happened on our ship."
Stop this immediately.
I had no intention of throwing them in either.
I just wanted to see someone's reaction.
What a waste.
You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.
Now it's Yongmun?
What if he recognizes Gil Dong?
This is getting complicated.
Still there's not too many of them to fight.
Go Add.
Don't you feel anything?
You've been quiet.
Scared?
"Come on, Add."
Mom.
I miss you.
I want to see you at the cemetery next time.
"Hey, why did you stop?"
Did you see a ghost?
"No, I'll take Dow to her mom's cemetery."
Huh?
You're going to a cemetery?
We've just escaped from one.
And we're going to a ghost city.
Are you crazy?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Why did you climb up?
"Aren""t you ashamed?"
Why to feel ashamed in doing my duty? show me your baskets!
Hey!
You want to seize our baskets!
The basket contains fishes and not gold!
I know you all very well!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
"What are you doing? constable, what are you doing?"
Are you mad?
Yes!
You have spoiled the fishes!
Now who will buy these fishes?
"Not just these fishes, I will cut open all the fishes in the oceans.. ..to check whether gold is hidden in it or not!"
Why are you after our fishes?
Go and check the fishes in the oceans!
Fine!
I am leaving!
I am leaving!
"Why are you screaming? seema, why are you running away from me?"
My friends have told me so many things about you.. ..that now I am afraid of you.
What did they tell you?
"- I won""t tell you!"
It will kill me!
Tell me!

"lf this continues, then we will have to shut down our business!"
And what about my money?
Yes! - shut up!

I had told you to bring gold and not fish!
"Papa, you can""t eat gold!"
You can eat fish!
"And Pryor, the man I really wanted was you."
That's very flattering.
Maybe.
"But unless you want him to die in your place, you better get that money."
"Well, I'll-- I'll have to think about it."
"Well, don't you take long."
I'll call back and don't you call the police.
You're being watched.
Hello?
Hello?
Did you recognize that voice?
Was that anybody you knew?
"No, I don't think so."
Was that him again?
Yes.
He's got Jordan.
Apparently I was number one on his shopping list but he made a mistake.
"Are those the pictures, Mrs. Pryor?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, this one."
( dramatic theme playing )
You know this guy?
No.
I don't think so.

I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.

You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.

Thank you very much!
I don't want your dirty money.
What do you mean my ditry money?
You think his money is clean?
"Don't worry mon, I'm different now."
You can ask Ms.Lee.
I thought you said you'd go back to school.
Did you do that?
You're the same as your father.
Are you OK?
You may go home after 10 mins...
When will she come back again to further consultation with a doctor?

Show them that even your heart is full of love.
You too can feel pain.
You are a true person.

Near this temple.

- We?
- Who else?
Who took the mirror and Shagalova to Dynin?
- They're not out there just killing for fame.
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.
- Every major city.
These guys are playing God.
"I mean, this whole religious twist?"
Who the hell do they think they are?
"Hell yeah, I believe in capital punishment!"
If they let me I'll pull the switch.
Get 'em all!
Kill 'em all!
"I'm all for it... because the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody"
"No, ...you don't even know!"
- Sign me up man.
- Sign me up.
- Where can I sign up?
- Yes.
- Or are you protecting someone?
No.
Or are you carrying the can since you don't got much time left?
- No.
"- Tell me, who wanted this from you?"
- Who are you protecting?
- I killed Ferhat.
Brother.
"Hey, brother."
- What's your problem?
- What do you want?
We just wanted to wake you up for breakfast.
"Okay, thanks."
You were on duty again last night?
You didn't sleep.
Was it hard last time you were in jail as well?
What is it to you?
Whatever man.
"Hey, what is this?"
Did it again?
You did it again?
You washed my pants with the letter in it?
Why don't you check it before?
What am I gonna do with this now?
"- I am sorry, abi."
- Fuck your apology.
When are you gonna stop being stupid?
You're the one who shouldn't have kept your letter in your pockets.
Fuck you.
Eat your breakfast.
Do it like he does.
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Today...
I'll sell all my flutes on half rates.
Now leave your hopes for me.
And take care of yourself.
Doctor has warned you not to play flute.
Doctor only identifies our disease... ...but not our pain and poverty.
"Shanta, you are my life."
I can't live without you.
Don't say that.
Yet our Kishan has to grow up.
He has to study and be a good citizen.
"Yes, okay, Shanta."
I'll not play flute.
But at least I can sell them.
"C'mon, Kishan, today we'll sell all the flutes."
"Ramu, come here."
Come!
You won't get anything by playing flutes.
Mr. Pasha!
My wife is very sick.
I'm in need of money.
Do you want money?
Take this money.
Take it.
Buy all my flutes and give me the charges.
Flutes?
What will I do with your flutes?
Play some tune!
Your favourite one.
The one that expresses love.
"Yes, I'll play it too."
I'll play all the tunes.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"For breakfast at midnight,"
To fall in love with strangers.
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
Yeah!
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely at the same time,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when,"
"We forget about the deadlines,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if,"
You keep me next to you.
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright,"
"If we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're, twenty-two, twenty-two!"
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"This place is too crowded,"
Too many cool kids.
(Who's Taylor Swift anyway?
Ew).
"Oh-ah, oh-ah."
"It seems like one of those nights,"
"We ditch the whole scene,"
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping.
Yeah!
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
"You are blind, your father is blind !"
What are you doing?
Why are you boxing?
Neelambar!
How come you are here?
I'm in trouble.
- Are you out of it?
How did you get rid of the trouble?
- I stuck it on someone else.
That's the rule.
Everyone transfers his trouble to someone else.
What's happening?
Why are horns blaring?
I think there is a queue for petrol.
- It's a traffic jam.
Tell him!
"Before the traffic gets jammed, let's go to our Neelambar Pitambar store."
Let's go to our store.
Understand in one attempt sometimes atleast.
Where are you going?
"Drive fast, sister."
- I am driving fast.
"This is not a plane, it is a rickshaw."
Where do you want to go?
Left or right?
- Take a right.
Take a left.
Stop.
In the garden.
Over there.
- Where?
I'll tackle him.
"Hey, why are you going away like that?"
What will you lose if you stay with me for some more time?
Oh God!
Did you get wet again?
Take this and dry yourself.
Pandarta?!
The train has no scheduled stop here.
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.
Oh!
My ring fell down.
This is a valuable ring.
You should not lose it.
Keep it.
This is the ring your father gave the first time.
Keep it.
Bananas!
Apples!
Salutations sir.
Why did the train stop?
The water is going over the tracks.
It may take about two hours to recede.
Please come and sit in my room until then.
Idiotic rain!
"Hey, ring up uncle and find out how father is."
At the same time ask him to send some vehicles.
We cannot stay here a long time.
Who is he?
"- He is Badri, son of Dasanna."
"He has so many people around him, is he such a big shot?"

Heavy clouds and showers are expected tonight.
How was it?
Was it okay?
Too slow.
It'll be night and raining by the time you finish.
"And smile, won't you?"
"Good, good."
Su-eun!
Let's do it again.
I can't hear you.
"Once more, please?"
I'm your only sister!
"So you're clumsy, aren't you?"
"You're a lousy artist, but your face is well-drawn."
I didn't know we had such a cutie in our park.
Oh?
This...
How did you know it was mine?
"Is there any other artist around here, dummy?"
It's all smudged.
Tell me it's a very important painting for you...
You could've just thrown it out.
But thanks anyway.
Damn!
You punk!
"I was going to be generous since you're cute, but..."
"Well, I'll let you off this time Today is your lucky day."
He is tall handsome guy.
Is it not enough?
I am not able to understand you.
"Mother, is it proper to teach her all this things?"
You shut up.
The society has changed.
You are an old woman by birth.
Do you think he will meet you again?
My friend rain will take care of that.
It will unite us.
None of the cards are useful.
When you dont have luck how can you win?
Show.
- What?
- Show.
My score is 60.
What about you?
50.
- What about you?
- Ten.
What is this?
Are you trying to cheat us?
"Do you know, here people will bash you if you try to cheat."
Is it new for me?
Just joking.
Distribute once again.
I will have the show and pay you.
Are you trying to fool us?
Give the money.
I dont have any.
I have given all of them to you only.
Dont try to scare me.
I am at home.
Welcome.
Thank you.
"Mustafa, this girl is very beautiful, too."
But...
There is pain in her eyes.
Have you burned this girl?
She burned you?
"No, I don't believe that..."
"These eyes have learned to get burned,  they don't know how to burn."
"These looks are not the ones that burn,  they are the ones that get burned."
Narin?!
I'm here...
"Narin, where are you?"
"This is my fate, Yasar..."
To look at Mustafa from a distance.
"I won't be able to be beside him until I die, but..."
I will always look at my husband from a distance...
Like this...
I will always look at my husband.
You haven't been eating...
They said so...
You should eat...
Think of your child...
Narin...
Where have you been?
"Where have you been, Narin?"
"I have been in the hell that you put me, Mustafa... (Singing in Kurdish)"
You are a rose
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
You are a rose
Do you know what lemons called in Warangal?
What are they called?
- They are called Lemons.
That is what is called extra speech.
Pour 2 litres.
- Ok.
"My boy, where is the club for playing cards?"
Search!
There is nothing you cannot find by searching.
I did not like your face.
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.
Is it sixty-eight?
I have sixty.
Keep the change.
Ah!
He gave 8 rupees less and asking me to keep the change?!
Ah!
What a son in law!
He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.
Leave the matter.
All these days she supported him.
Now you are doing that?
He left us at home with out any care and.. .. now we dont know in which club or .. ..under which tree he is playing cards.
I am here!
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
"Gil Dong, the soldiers are coming!"
"Run, quickly!"
I told you not to look for me!
There's no time!
"I'll try to divert the soldiers, so you run that way!"
You!
Are you going to die in my stead?
Why would I die?
Do you know how fast I am? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm faster than you and faster than arrows!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
So run away!
How can you be faster than arrows? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I don't hear anything now.
Do you think they're far from here?
I can't see.
Move your hand...!
Who are you?
Do you know me?
Hey!
Hey!
Chungyi ran away!
I know.
She's safe.
But we have a problem.
Why are you running away?
Hey!
That's... that's Doe Eyes!
We can't be seen by her.
We have to go!
Where did he go?
Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Are you in here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Why did you just leave like that?
Who are you? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why did you help me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- How much?
10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.
Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
- So?
I didn't realise whether it was a cow or a bull.
Why?
Was the bull wearing pants that you couldn't find out?
You fool.
Go and get betel leaf for me.
I am in the mood for betel leaf today.
"Father, money?"
I gave you 10 rupees in the morning.
I.. lent it.. to friend?
On what interest rate?
- One..
One percent.
None.
If you don't get the money in 24 hours.. ..then I will recover the money by selling you off?
"But father, who will purchase me?"
Quiet.
Get out.
You fool.
Who are you?
10 rupees.
And 50 paise interest.
But how can I take this?
I can't accept this?
- Keep it.
Everything I own belongs to you as well as me.
"No, no, no, no, no.."
"You shouldn't touch my feet, da.."
Kishen.
I suggest you accompany me to my restaurant.
I will treat you to a cup of tea.
Or let's go to my place.
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
Why can't we do that?
Speak up
Can't we not hear it?
No， she must tell me why
My mammy said a man getting intimate with a girl before marriage may desert her some day
Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily
What now?
Go down for the wedding night
Okay
Go now
"Sister, now the 1st thing is to take a bath"
Hurry up
Why are you wearing a hat?
Higher
Open up， Mimi， the groom's here
Take care

"Go home, it's going to rain."
You'll get drenched.
It's an earthquake.
Swamiji Rain?
Rain?
- Rain?
My hand's paining.
I won't be able to write my exam tomorrow.
I'll slap you.
I'll make you hold the pen in your mouth and write your paper.
You're scolding him.
But what about you?
- What did I do?
What?
The festivities were left incomplete.
You've to admit that there's God.
You spread the rumour.. ..and immediately there was an earthquake.
- Remember.
- What earthquake?
Even the utensils didn't budge.
Papa.
I think they took your announcement too seriously.
This news just came in from parts of the country.. ..that the idol of Sri Krishna's eating butter.
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.
"Priest, offer the Lord some buttermilk."
"People are offering cheese, cottage-cheese.. ..butter, buttermilk to the idol of Krishna."
"- Oh, God!"
The rumour has spread so far.
"Please, eat it."
This is low-cholesterol cheese.
I will not be scared?
Nothing is left with me.
I dont have watch or chain.
What will you do?
Bash me?
Do it.
Continue the game.
"Who are you, sir?"
He is Badris man.
Why are you giving me the money?
- Play.
"You please play, sir."
I dont know how to play?
You play.
We can settle terms later.
There is a bar nearby.
Come there after you finished the game.
When does it rain?
When black clouds appear.
When does the black clouds appear?
Just before the rain comes.
You idiot!
I can tell you when the petrol tanker will come.. ..but how could you expect me to know when it will rain.
"Not only me, nobody can tell you that."
I can tell.
- Tell what?
What is the program on TV at 7 p.m.?
A serial named Jeevanarogalu.
After that?
- We will get headache.
After that?
- News will come.
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!
I'll let go when I count to 3 and you hook him out 1， 2， 3
Get hold of him
Wait.
Why are you still staying here?
I want to get your first time
lf I can't break your virginity before midnight
I'll never get reincarnated
Where's Robert?
I'm Robert.
Robert is me
Lisa， please help me so I may get reincarnated
Never
Let me help you if sister won't do it
Don't! lf you touch me I may be sent down to hell
What?
Sorry， I can't help you
I'll find someone else then.
Bye
Never.
Get hold of him
Get hold of him
Get hold of him.
Don't let him get away
Follow him
Landal， are you all right?
It's all because of you
Had you yielded to me， he wouldn't have got you involved
I....
Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
"- Good job, Christine."
"- Oh, thanks. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Monti?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It just shows the inexperience.
- Helene?
- Helene is a disaster.
Helene was shocking.
"According to them, it was, like, way undercooked."
You're not the worst.
She is.
And Tali.
I mean...
Disaster.
I don't know what Tali was up to.
- No.
- Dave?
"The sand, you know, big, big technical error."
"I didn't wash the mushrooms, and I think I started too late."
"Any freakin' dish but risotto, man."
"Like, seriously."
Ryan and Tali are the two people that I want to see go home.
They're just total idiots.
"And, if they don't stay on their toes,"
I'm gonna be the one to take 'em out.
Clearly we have to take him out.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
I'm gonna have to throw someone under the bus.
"Once one of 'em's gone, the other one's..."
"Remember, you're the best."
- How do you feel?
- Good.
"All right, guys. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon) Back to your stations, please."
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."
"- Your parents aren't here, are they?"
- No.
My hours are between 4:30 and 5:30 before they get back from work.
Any musical requests?
The right tune creates the right vibe.
Coldplay?
50 Cent?
Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."
We're going to do a standard one first.
"Wow, you're a natural."
- Really?
- Not too firm or toothy.
- That's very common with beginners.
- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.

Man:

Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
"In his things we found fishing lines, hooks and lures!"
What do you think he was going to do with all that?
I think we've all had quite enough.
I have therefore decided to expel Inochkin.
I'm done.
"""No exit without permission."""
- Kostya!
Kostya!
- Come back to visit!
- Come back to visit!
- Comrade Dynin?
- That's my name.
- Comrade Dynin.
"- What ""comrade Dynin?"""
- It's not fair.
I think...
- You think too much.
- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!
- You're all flustered about this Inochkin.
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted...
I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
"I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So...
Was it worth it?
How do you feel?
Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today...
We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
"Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will,"
I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
"Alright, woohoo!"
"Go, Rarity!"
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
"Beautiful, beautiful dresses!"
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
"You're not a laughingstock, Rarity..."
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Just to feel better about yourselves
Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank

"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
I saw.. and along with that inflation.
It affects each and everyone.
"Don""t cry."
Because of this..
"Because of this, l never got married."
I never got married. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
You are asleep.
And the enemy is alert.
Wake up. otherwise you will be in trouble.
Hey!
That country will be robbed.
"That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep."
Where the guards go to sleep.

"Don""t talk nonsense!"
Someone's coming!
So this is where you've been?
Shall I paint you a portrait?
It's for free.
Can't you take that off?
Wait!
"Okay, I'll paint you like that."
"But next time you'll take it off, right?"
Take it off?
This punk...
He's got a weird taste...
You punk... what are you smirking about?
- Aren't you hot?
-Wouldn't you be?
- I'm roasting in here.
"- If I were you, I'd take it off."
I'm dying of curiosity.
Are you a man by any chance?
There are plenty of guys with long hair.
And lots of guys have pretty legs.
Right... men don't wear bras
"All right, stop it."
You little cutie... don't be so shy.
I know...
Your face is really ugly!
I'm joking.
You're so cute.
This is what I like about my job.
Jin-woo...
"If you don't show up, we're through."
We apologizes to customers that the fire alarm has begun.
Please evacuate to the...
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.

Thank you.
Come and drink soup some other day
Outrageous!
I'll win her over for sure
Landal， what are you doing the whole night?
Go and see a doctor tomorrow
What're you doing?
I told you to my underpants but you're watching the landscape
Appear before me when I count up to three 1， 2， 3
Sister wants you to go down to have dinner
Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
I have turned into a horse.
Know what she gave me for breakfast today?
Egg shampoo.
You are laughing?
Thank your stars she served you egg shampoo.
She gave me a white handkerchief in my milk as cream.
Take this file.
Go through it.
- Is this the file of your murder case?
What did you say?
"I meant, whose murder case file is this?"
A man named Manish will strike a deal in diamonds worth millions. . . in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Then let him strike the deal first.
- Why?
Because law says that until someone commits a crime. . . you cannot nab him.
"As soon as he strikes the deal, you will catch him red handed."
Both saw the time.
Both jumped in.
Something fishy.
Even I will jump in.
I won't spare you !
I won't spare you !
Where are you going?
"- Girls, what are you doing?"
"I am on duty, let me go."
Where are you hiding?

Government is releasing Jackie six months early... ...because of his good conduct.
"Inspector Varma, if government will allow me... ...to commit one murder, I'd kill Jackie first."
That snake can bit us anytime.
Damodar!
Keep an eye on him.
"Yes, I'm eyeing him, uncle."
I'm eyeing him.
But now I'll keep strict watch.
Strict!
Who?
Jackie?

I'm dying for fresh tuna
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
She never went out once with us in over a year
She's a Hikikomori
- She doesn't shut herself at home - Someday she will
"- We're having tuna, right?"
"- No, sausages"
You can't mess with tuna like that!
Come on!
I want tuna!
The best!
"I'll buy tuna, then!"
"A big can, that is"
Roll it around
"Happy birthday, Sweetie I sent a gift"
What Mom?
- A husband - What?
I signed you up at a marriage agency to meet men
You didn't have to do that
How's work?
When will you become a magician?
It's just a part-time job
How's everything there?
Good
Great air and nice people
It's so beautiful here
"Second man, out of shot:"
"Look at his face, this filth."
[One man laughs.]
Another man:
They shot us with live ammunition
Cameraman:
One bullet in his leg and one in his stomach.
Another man:
"For God to bless you, put him in the morgue."
Man out of shot:
Pick him up with me.
Several voices:
"Slowly, carefully."
"A soul, a soul."
One man:
"This is a human, in the end this is a soul..."
Another man:
"Arrange his arms properly, arrange his arms."
Cameraman:
Was he shot yesterday?
Or today?
It looks like it was from yesterday.
Another man:
Where are his ID cards and stuff?
Cameraman:
"I don't know, search his pockets...the guys must have taken them."
Another man:
"He's not Libyan, I don't think he's Libyan."
Cameraman:
"He's stiffened, you can't arrange his body properly."
"It must be from yesterday, not today."

"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.
He can't change without a blanket or fan
He can hid inside the thick mattress
Move it away
Let's watch inside.
You do it
Do it
Yes， do it
I can't with so many eyes looking at us
Ok， let's push up the bed 1， 2， 3
Act fast， but not too hard， or we can't hold it
It works
Darling， can such a wedding night be recorded in the Book of Guinness?
Landal How come?
What happened?
She's kicking me
I didn't
No?
This bed?
Why's everything missing?
Why?
I beg you， or I can't get reincarnated
You're crafty， you've changed into a bedsheet
Take it out and burn it
Don't!
Tsung， bring gasoline
Let's go out first
Keep and eye on him
Don't burn me
Don't let him go
Come on， sprinkle it on him
Keep away， let me
You're taking away my girlfriend?
"Then, we're all going out"
I have stuff to do at home I'm sorry
No exceptions this time
That was strong
I have to do the laundry and feed my dog
"That can all wait, can't it?"
My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal
"Then, let it go crazy"
I'll be there in spirit Sorry
"No, you'll be there in person!"
"If it isn't your parents' funeral, be there"
"- She'll never come - This time, she will"
- Bet $100?
- Sure
That's fascist
Fascist?
Me?
I just wanna take the whole crew out!
That doesn't make any sense What's with you?
I don't want to go
You have to
- No - Why?
Not everyone likes to drink
Then don't!
Drink Coke instead!
How can I drink Coke with beer in front of me?
Looking good
"Okay, fine"
I'll go
But I act out when I'm drunk
"Me, too"
I can drink 7 bottles of Soju
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?

"Tell me, friends, who do we call the most worthy?"

- Who gather grass for rabbits.
- Very good.
"And so, the most worthy ones will be allowed... ...to join the circle of champions wearing masquerade costumes."
- Is showing magic tricks a talent?
- A talent.
"- Okay, I can show the ""flying queen"" card trick."

Only no cards.

It's all good.
"Eat, eat."

My son was supposed to be cleaning his room yesterday.
We activate the protocol she signed before the marriage.
"Yes, exactly..."
All her obligations will be put in effect.
"If she wants to divorce, she has to pay me all the compensation written in the contract."
Let's see if she can divorce me now.
He will be even more hostile towards you now.
"He should thank God, that he still breathes."
Or I know what I would do to him.

Did you really love him?
Then why did you doubt him?
I did not doubt him.
It was he who told a lie.
"Ok, he told a lie."
But why?
Because he wanted you and could not leave you.
Everyone does not get true love.
You are fortunate to get that.
Why do you wish to know?
No reason
"I fear for his safety, that is all"
"I'm sworn to protect him as well as yourself, Your Majesty"

For your loyalty
There were supposed to be only six legions!

What now?
Where are you going?
Home
No prior engagements today?
No
You still have four legions loyal to you
Four legions
Have you given up hope
Perhaps I have
Caesar once stopped a whole army with only two legions
I'm not Caesar!
"I am not a god, I am not a king"
I'm a man
I'm just a man who reached for too big a prize!
Where is he now?
Octavius has taken Pelusium
That quickly
Give these to Rufio
Have him deliver them to Octavius
But these are the emblems of your office!
Send them to him with this letter
I am offering my abdication if he'll spare Caesarian... and let him sit on the throne of Egypt
"But why, Your Majesty?"
Has it really come to this?
There is no other recourse
We must buy time
Go now!
Down
Out of my way!
Stop it!
What?
What?
Why did you stop...
"Welcome, welcome Aphrodite!"
Welcome to Bacchus's beach!
Octavius has reached Ashkelon
Ashkelon is weeks away from Alexandria
He's sailing into a trap!
Pull back!
Octavius!
Boarders!
"Your Majesty, you must go below"
Drive them back!
Fight for your Queen!
Force them back!
Where is Antony?
We must find him!
"His flagship sank, Your Majesty"
He might still be alive..
"Forgive me, but he can't survive that"
"Octavius will be searching for you, my Queen"
I can't leave him here I must do something!
You must save yourself while you can!
For Egypt!
Antony!
"Take out the purple sails, have them ready to hoist before Alexandria"
Our victory sails?
"You heard me, now do it!"
"As you wish, Your Highness"
Exactly as I wish
Place the garlands on the bow
On the masts as well
And have the men ready to sing a victory chant... before we sail into Alexandria
I shall not allow my people to see their Queen in defeat
"lsis, my mother don't turn from me now"
Don't turn from Egypt
No!
No!

"Guys, isn't this what you wanted?"
Wanted?
You didn't see what he did to us
"Like I told you before, we have to cope with it till the condition stabilises"
And when is that?
He sold everything and withdrew the money
That's Alzheimer's
The patient acts in confusion and then stabilises
Hopefully he'll stabilise and tell you where the money is
Did he even have Alzheimer's in the first place?
"What about the medication we use to give him, Mr.Karim?"
Did you forget?
Screw all this
My department also has the same opinion.
"You doubted him right, Damodar."
This is Jimmy's report.
I've brought it from intelligence department.
He's a smuggler.
He's connected with a smuggling gang from Singapore.
This is his file.
"The moment we get some evidence, we'll arrest him."
That's a lie.
Fine!
"I'm lying, Damodar is lying."
Even the ClD officers are lying.
Only my friend Shreekant is right.
But uncle.
How You better don't interrupt.
Just keep quiet.
If the son-in-law will be a smuggler... ...your house will be filled with smuggled goods.
We'll become a millionaire.
Our daughter will be happy.
Our family will get prestige.
- Mr. Bharat!
- Yes.
Did you understand?

You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?

You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision

It's here.
There's column two.
"So this, again, you see what its"
components are.
"Its components are minus one,"
two.
Good.
That's this guy.
Now I have to take a combination.
What combination shall I take?
"Why not the right combination, what"
the hell?
Okay.
So the combination I'm going
to take is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.
So the right combination is to take
x as one of those and two of these.
It's because we already know that
"that's the right x and y, so why not take the correct"
combination here and see it happen?
"Okay, so how do I picture this"
linear combination?
So I start with this vector that's

Life and work.
"Turner was born in Cromford, Derbyshire in England, then moved to Derby with his family. His father Thomas Turner was a tailer and favoured art works, so he adviced his son to learn art and music. Turner made progress mainly by himself, and became a professional painter and art teacher."
"Turner lived in Derbyshire all his life. In 1865 he married Eliza Lakin (1837 - 1900), and worked as a part-time farmer raising four children at Walnut farm in Barrow upon Trent."
"After Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter."

Europa (moon)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
"Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

Beriberi
Beriberi (also called vitamin B1 deficiency) is a disease of the nervous system. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their diet.
"Thiamine helps the body turn food into energy. People need thiamine for good brain function and a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. It also helps the nervous system work properly."
"Without enough thiamine, a person’s body cannot create all the energy the person needs. As a result, people with beriberi have severe lethargy and feel exhausted. Beriberi can also cause muscles to get weaker. These symptoms can make it hard for a person to do simple things."
Some people with beriberi have heart problems or even die. Beriberi can also cause problems with the gastrointestinal system.
"Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly white rice."
There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the cardiovascular system. Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. There is also a rare type of genetic beriberi.
"Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi."

Esteban Bullrich
"In 1904, Lorentz showed that electrical and magnetic fields can be modified into each other through the Lorentz transformations."
"In 1905, Einstein published his article introducing special relativity, ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"", in ""Annalen der Physik"". In this article, he presented the postulates of relativity, derived the Lorentz transformations from them, and (unaware of Lorentz's 1904 article) also showed how the Lorentz Transformations affect electric and magnetic fields."
"Later in 1905, Einstein published another article presenting ""E"" = ""mc""2."
"In 1908, Max Planck endorsed Einstein's theory and named it ""relativity"". In that same year, Hermann Minkowski gave a famous speech on ""Space and Time"" in which he showed that relativity is self-consistent and further developed the theory. These events forced the physics community to take relativity seriously. Relativity came to be more and more accepted after that."
"In 1912, Einstein and Lorentz were nominated for the Nobel prize in physics due to their pioneering work on relativity. Unfortunately, relativity was so controversial then, and remained controversial for such a long time that a Nobel prize was never awarded for it."

Icosane
"Icosane, also commonly spelled eicosane, is an alkane or a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula H20C42. It has 366,319 structural isomers. Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, ""n""-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature."
Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.
Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.

and he was fourteen years old.
"And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers"
"and before that we had all Dachshunds,"
"and I think my husband wants another Dachshund,"
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown
"and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog."
"Yeah,"
"it, it, it was heavy when we were there though."
Yeah.
"I didn't see any boats there, though."
"Not, not, not too many, no."
"But, uh, no,"
I just got back from a weekend.
"We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing."
"It was pretty nice,"
"but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff."
Yeah?
"That's a lot of fun,"
"but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,"
they're kind of into it.
"Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats."
"Oh, yeah,"
"I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here."
Yeah.
All right.
"So, where about in Texas is that?"
Is that centrally located
"or,"
"It's, uh, well,"
you ever heard of Lufkin?
"Uh, no,"
"what, what major city is nearby?"
Houston.
"Okay,"
and that's south or north of there or something?
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"There is, course, the the Grand Canyon"
"and, uh, the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way."
Yes.
"And, course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone"
"and, uh, the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too."
I imagine.
"Yeah,"
I would imagine they are.
"Course, I, I guess I'm partial to big tree country."
Yeah.
I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now
"I think it's called a job,"
I don't know
"Uh, not a whole lot of forestry down there, is there?"
No
not around here.
Oh.
Not around here
Place is forested with with those concrete trees.
"Uh-huh,"
"lot, lot of concrete and glass, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, I guess that's God's place, too."
"Anyway, Uh, what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping?"
Yeah.
"Uh, probably the, the last one that I went to California"
"I took, uh, three weeks."
Three weeks.
And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks.
"Yeah,"
"the whole family, then, was in on this?"
Uh-huh.
"It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, what, six months pregnant."
Uh-huh.
"So I don't know,"
it worked pretty well.
"It was one of those, uh, those, dome type pop up tents."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Nice and quick and easy to put up.
Yeah.
Packs away nice and small
"and, about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto."
"Well, that's true,"
that's true.
It was a lot of fun.
"I guess the last real, uh, camping trip I took was, has been a couple years ago."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Uh, I went to California up to the Sequoias."
"Wow,"
that's got to be beautiful territory.
"Yeah,"
"it's gorgeous,"
I love the big trees.
"Just, just the drive up through, uh, up the coast line and then cut over in, into the, into the parks, it's gorgeous, though."
Yeah.
"What, like, Sequoia National Park?"
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had been there before when I lived in California,"
"but that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe"
Yeah.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,"
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills"
and they're bouncing checks all over the place
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
"uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks."
"Well, we have,"
"we used to, when I was younger"
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
"I'm, uh, kind of a sailor."
Yeah.
"I'm up in Minneapolis now,"
but I was in Florida
"so, uh, yeah,"
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
"Yeah,"
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
"I had a little sail,"
"Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here"
No
"Just motorboat's all we,"
What part of Texas you from?
"Uh, Nacogdoches."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
"Uh, probably four or five days."
Uh-huh.
"Well, that is great."
"Well, I hope the weather stays real good for them. And, and, uh, that you have a good visit and everything."
"Well, thank you"
Thanks.
And I hope your garden does good.
Yeah.
And the same to you.
"And, so. Okay."
"Well, it was really nice talking to you."
A pleasure.
"And, uh, good luck in your, this venture."
"It is, uh, like I said,"
it has been real interesting.
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I have been enjoying it
I am sure I will.
"In, in fact, if I had not been preparing for this, the out of town visitors, I probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days."
"Yeah,"
I forget to.
"The day goes by,"
and I forget to make a call usually.
"Well, I am glad you have broken the ice with me because now, I will, I will start doing it"
"Great,"
great.
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, thanks, Jean."
Uh. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
"is, uh, that a sport you like to participate in?"
Oh my goodness.
"And with our budget cuts, I'm sure  that's not going to not going to change anytime soon."
Yeah.
"Well that's the only way they're. Yeah, well, that's the only way they're going to be able to do it."
And parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that.
Oh my goodness.
"So, in some ways I think the, the day schools do serve those purposes."
Yeah.
That's true.
"Well even the preschools, you know they get so much of that in preschool"
"and then when they hit kindergarten, you know, it's like wham  Culture shock."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's just,"
Put the colors away
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Get the computers out
Which is too bad.
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
hard.
Uh-huh.
It's so difficult for them.
"Um, did you have your children, did you say in home, in, in, private care,"
was that in your home or in someone else's home?
Until they were two.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
both times they were at our house.
Uh-huh.
So you were able to have somebody come there.
"Are, are you a T I-er?"
"No,"
"no,"
I work there as a temporary.
"Oh, really."
"But, are you at T I?"
Oh yeah.
So you have to do the random drug testing.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about,"
I'm so much for it.
I don't really have much to comment about it.
There've been some interesting subject that they've called about.
"How many times have you called,"
or have you been participating in this?
"Oh, about ten or eleven calls."
"Oh, you got ten,"
"well you, you've passed me up."
Right.
This is about six times.
Oh.
"As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too."
Yeah.
It doesn't bother me.
I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything.
"No,"
I think it's good.
"In fact, I don't know what the statistics were,"
but I think that they were surprised to find it so low.
"I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I."
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
"Yes,"
I am familiar with that.
"I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it."
"And we bought it from someone who was in it,"
"but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm not sure what happened,"
"but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years."
"Oh, no."
"I, I, I found a lot of things,"
"but,"
"I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia."
"Oh, my,"
yeah.
"Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois."
"Oh, do they have one?"
"Yes,"
they do.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
"Well, I learned something already"
Yeah.
"Well, let's see,"
"the three questions are what, uh,"
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
"Oh, yeah,"
"well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college"
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
"yeah,"
"I see what you're saying,"
"there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,  rather than"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Did you go with kids though?
"and how it fits with the character , right."
Did you go with kids?
Excuse me?
Did you take kids along?
"No,"
"we went, uh, without the kids,"
"it's was a night out, away from the children."
"Oh, I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them. especially to come home"
Oh.
"and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day,"
I'm sure.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"that, that's true."
"I, I was thinking about that too,"
"I saw that, um,"
"that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was uh, uh, the one about the, um, the turtles,"
"Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."
Right
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"I saw that with my cousin, just to see what, you know, what the kids are into"
"And your cousin's a kid,"
"and that is,"
"yeah,"
he's a little
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
"If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care."
"I, I, give me cyanide."
"I mean, is it )),"
"Yeah,"
right.
I'll take anything you know.
Uh-huh.
"I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me."
"Ri-,"
Exactly.
Go ahead.
"And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,"
Exactly.
"let them, do it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's what I think they're saying too.
Have you had any snow up your way?
"No,"
"we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas"
"and, uh we had a lot before Christmas."
Um.
The ski resorts were really
"and, uh,"
"but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,"
"so,"
"but no, uh, no snow."
Um.
"The snows all melted off uh,"
"Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend"
"and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way."
"Uh-huh,"
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I guess you are.
Uh-huh.
That we dress in the jeans
"and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But there's not much,"
middle of the road.
It's nice that there's not a requirement for it.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Sometimes I think there should be.
Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines.
"Oh, yeah,"
right
"Yeah,"
I guess you see those once in a while.
"And you know the, they have the no shorts deal,"
"and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being."
Sure.
"But, uh, You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code."
Yeah.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress code, something about spaghetti straps,"
I'm not even sure what they are.
Supposedly and backless things
"Oh, backless,"
all right.
"but, I've seen those, too,"
"but,"
"Okay,"
"so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation,"
"but, I think we, we did it"
"Uh, yeah."
"Okay,"
"and, and your name was Lisa."
Lisa.
Great.
Are you the Expressway sites?
"I am,"
"yes,"
and I work in the north building.
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, well, thank you."
Thank you.
"All right,"
good day.
"Uh-huh,"
bye-bye.
"Uh, advice on son or daughter going to college."
Right.
"Uh, that's advice that I will need in time future for my children, rather than one that I have, uh, personal experience with"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to, to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet, meet those needs."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"uh, let's see,"
"when I, when I went away to school, I'm trying to think my criteria."
"I guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed college"
"That was a, a strict requirement for me."
and that was almost twenty years ago
Uh-huh.
"It isn't,"
"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh,"
"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too"
"uh, uh, just last year"
"and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case"
"and it seemed it really, trivial."
It involved two bicycles.
We didn't do the sentencing.
The judge did.
Huh.
So
How interesting.
"we, we rendered a verdict"
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh
And that was here in Wisconsin.
"So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,"
"I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California."
"Hi,"
"this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota."
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
"Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it."
Yep.
"Uh, I'm ready whenever you are."
Okay
"So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there?"
"Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous."
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
I'm Jennifer.
And where are you from?
Pennsylvania.
"Oh, nice,"
"I'm from Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"so,"
"Oh, that's neat."
"Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we,"
"Uh, television shows?"
Yeah
"Sure,"
that sounds good.
Okay
"I, I don't watch too many,"
but we can try it.
Okay.
Are you ready to start?
Sure am.
"Okay,"
just a minute
"Okay,"
I guess we're recording now.
"Yeah,"
okay.
What are your favorite television shows?
"Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here."
"Oh, really?"
"And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,"
"but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,"
"Oh, I love that show."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"
the different kinds
Yeah.
"because I've only ridden in the one,"
"What, what kind was it?"
that's it.
"Uh, shoot"
I can't even think of the name of it now.
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,"
"we have two kids,"
and we went to Disney World
Uh-huh.
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,"
"and I went to see my mother,"
"and then went on down to Disney World,"
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon."
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
yeah
"I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,"
so.
"Right,"
"right,"
"I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them."
"I found about five, uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters."
Yeah.
"Oh gosh,"
"so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes, when, you know, these are perfect,"
Uh-huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off"
so you can't use it anyway.
"Right,"
"and he had a bunch of computer stuff,"
"and, you know, I bought it all."
It was two hundred bucks for everything he had.
You got a buy.
"Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know."
Sure.
"You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable."
"Melted, or Just wet"
"or,"
"Well, yeah"
", or wet"
Okay.
"But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,"
"Okay,"
"Cindy, you there?"
Yeah.
"Oh, the wood chuck song"
And I still can to this date.
"And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song"
Yeah.
"Yep,"
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
"Oh, bless your heart."
"Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all."
"Oh, yeah,"
any time I got bored
"Oh, okay,"
"but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?"
No.
No.
"And Jaws,"
but I think everybody can.
Okay.
"I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky"
"because I,"
"if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,"
"but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,"
Yeah.
so
Yeah.
"I played uh, concertos and other stuff"
"but,"
"I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,"
"so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,"
"but anyway,"
Yeah.
"but I enjoy it, though."
"I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit"
Yeah.
"and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think."
"They call late,"
"now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or"
"Oh, they do already."
"See, that's"
I would be so mad
"Well,"
"and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too."
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
"Don't answer your phone, Hello."
"The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello."
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
"I don't know,"
"I think like things that, that"
"I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically."
"Oh, yeah."
That drives me up a wall.
Are you and your roommate a similar size.
"No,"
"see, we're not,"
"and, uh."
And she still goes through your clothes?
"Yeah,"
"she'll take all my shirts and stuff,"
"American Express does that, by the way."
"Oh, they do?"
"Yeah,"
"I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them."
"Well, sure it is."
"And that is an invasion of privacy,"
you're right.
That's right.
"Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere"
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever."
"Exactly,"
"magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing"
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
"But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,"
"you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,"
"so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling."
"Yeah,"
that's right.
"So, I don't know."
"What, what do you, where are you from?"
"Oh, I'm from Texas."
"Oh, okay,"
"well so,"
"yeah,"
"we live in the Dallas area, Richardson."
"Oh, we're in Plano."
Okay
"Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out of state,"
It's not getting any better.
"Yeah,"
I can't even hear what you're
"Oh, okay."
"Oh jeez,"
it's gone.
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,"
"but every time I have this phone is a little weird,"
I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
"Well, I don't know,"
there was
"well, whatever it was, there was a second there"
"I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"
"but, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I was beating on the phone going,"
Can you hear me.
"Yeah,"
I guess I was having a hard time there too.
"I thought it sounded,"
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work."
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
"yeah,"
"I mean, that's a heck of a"
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,"
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil."
"Yeah,"
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes."
Uh-huh.
She likes to really get into her pumpkins
"and see how many she can grow. corn, potatoes,"
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them."
Oh.
Boy.
Yeah
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
"Yeah,"
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog"
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter.
He said it was a good jolt.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques."
Um.
I don't think they're always necessary.
"If you put enough patience into,"
"Yeah,"
just be consistent and diligent with it
Uh-huh.
"and, um,"
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?"
Yeah
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months."
Somebody just told me that
Yeah.
because of the leukemia?
"Yeah,"
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up."
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
Wow.
"So,"
I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
Really.
"I mean, we're all grown,"
"all her kids are grown,"
and we have our own families
Uh-huh.
"and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?"
"Yeah,"
get out of my cabinets.
"Like, what are you doing?"
Don't you have your own house to dig through?
That's great.
"Yeah,"
"so, I guess, privacy is really,"
"and at the work place, I suppose,"
"oh, well, actually yes."
"I can say definitely, privacy at the work place."
Uh-huh.
I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
See.
Yeah.
"because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,"
"and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way."
"You could tell,"
"you know you put your stuff where it's,"
Yeah.
"That would drive, that would, that"
"It would drive, it drove me batty for a while."
Really.
"Yeah,"
"well, I worked a second shift"
Our local schools have adult education in the evening
Oh.
"uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance."
I'm an artist.
"Oh, okay."
And I'm very handy
"and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually."
That's great.
"What, what type of art do you focus on?"
I have a Master's degree
"and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,"
but I'm really interested in the crafts.
Huh.
I make stain glass.
I've done some silver jewelry making
"and I kind of,"
"once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else"
Yeah.
"Kind of jack of all trades, master of none."
"Yeah,"
"well no,"
"actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,"
"you didn't buy it,"
you made it.
That's great!
"And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone"
so let's do something else.
Right.
"You want to, uh, explore a new field"
"or, or,"
"Well, yeah,"
"I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet"
Yeah.
"and then, you know, if you didn't have a car that had one, then your insurance would go up enormously,"
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"uh, I've got to go"
"my son's in a performance tonight,"
"I have to leave, in a couple of minutes."
"Oh that's okay,"
"Uh, I think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time."
Okay.
"It was good talking to you,"
"Well, you, you too."
Okay.
Good night.
All right
bye bye.
"Okay,"
"Dee, are you familiar with the Latin American policies?"
"Yeah,"
"to a point,"
it's not my best subject.
"Really,"
yeah
"it's not mine either,"
"but, uh, I know, I know our policy,"
"like in Nicaragua, I am familiar with that because we have, uh, some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border"
and they are missionaries there
"and they, they live there"
"and they have to travel by boat forty-five minutes to get to their car and stuff,"
"and uh, I know that they helped a lot of those Sandanistas refugees coming across the border"
and they housed them and stuff.
"They have been down there about three years now,"
"we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,"
"so if you,"
Really?
Yeah
For smashed cans?
"Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot."
"Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?"
Sure.
"I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed"
Okay.
Okay?
"Oh, okay,"
"well, I guess, I guess,"
"Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time"
Yeah
"Okay,"
"well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can."
"Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?"
"Uh, no,"
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that.
Yeah.
Exactly
"and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,"
"so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed."
"Oh, okay."
Type of thing.
"Okay,"
"no,"
they don't charge us that extra nickel.
"That's sort of nice, though"
"It, it just makes your skin more leathery."
and I think that is why.
"It, uh, it,"
Exactly.
yeah.
"So,"
"I think it burns off the,"
"I don't know the, the, the theory, the scientific principle."
"But it burns something off, the natural oils or something like that."
Uh-huh.
"Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it."
They say it destroys a lot of that.
Yes.
And you lose a lot of that.
"So, uh,"
"Yes,"
"uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory."
"Yeah,"
"but, uh, but we have really had nice,"
"the weather,"
I can't complain.
We have really had really good weather of late.
Good.
"And when it has rained, it it's been a good soaking rain"
"and, uh, it has just been a really nice Spring."
"Well, that is great."
"It has been, it has been very nice here too."
And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain.
Oh.
"Oh, that is great."
How long will they be there?
Uh-huh.
"yeah,"
"he's,"
"anyway, and that was just excessively violent."
I was worried
"Yeah,"
isn't it amazing.
"it's like golly,"
"if kids start imitating that they'll knock each others blocks off,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it was all bloodless
Uh-huh.
and the good guys can get hit all day long
Uh-huh.
and they have to shake it off
Yeah.
"they don't, they don't, you know, get, uh, epileptics, that sort of thing from getting hit on their head"
Right.
"you know, it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,"
"partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book on the other hand it makes it seem like,"
Uh-huh.
"I read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies, don't have very realistic upsets of the violence."
"The violence can seem very realistic,"
but the aftermath is usually not there.
Right.
"So you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions"
Uh-huh.
"they thrash around,"
"they scream, you know, uh,"
"it's just a very, very bad thing,"
"and they never present that,"

"""Ruth Shorts"" was Thomas Shorts's first boat. She was named for his mother. ""Ruth Shorts"" was a rowboat that could make a roundtrip from Penticton to Okanagan Landing in nine days. ""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

"Tawfiq was born in Cairo, Egypt on 31 August 1943. In 1965 he graduated from the University of Cairo, Faculty of Literature and received a Bachelor diploma. After 13 years, in 1978, he received the Master diploma in Arabic literature. He takes an active part in the cultural life of Egypt, and belongs to different Literature associations, including the Writers Association of Egypt since 1966, The Writer's Workshop of Cairo since 1967 and the Association of New Literature of Cairo since 1971."
Tawfiq noted who had a significant influence on his future works:
"""After my teacher, miss Suheir al-Qalmawi, has read my verses, I became her favorite student. That made me very glad because al-Qalmawi was the first person who discovered me like a poet. She compared me with known American writer Edgar Allan Poe. I have heard about this author but never read any of his texts. That's why just next day I found a book with Poe's verses and read there his poem ""The Raven"". I didn't understand some moments, but soon I found my teacher, professor Muhammad Mandur, who translated this poem into Arabic. He, and the other professor, Yusef Khalif, helped me on my way to become a poet in future""."
"Tawfiq noted the influence of the Writers Association of Egypt on his future literary preferences, stating"
"""I will never forget, that through Writers Association of Egypt, authors of my generation had opportunity to become acquainted with such famous writers and poets as Salah Abdel Sabour, Farouk Khorshid, Abdelgafar Makawi, Izuddin Ismail, Husein Nisar, Abdel Qader al-Qytt, Abdel Rahman al-Sharqawi, Ahmad Kemal Zaki, Ahmad Husein as-Saui, Muhammad Abdel Wahid, Malek Abdel Aziz and others ..."""
"In 1990 Tawfiq's ""Sinbad and the New Voyage"" won the award for best poem in the Foundation of Abdulaziz Saud al-Babtain's Prize for Poetic Creativity in Cairo."

"Her commitment to her family, to social action, to the theatre and to teaching meant that she led a full and active life with what seemed an inexhaustible reserve of energy. In fact the day before she died, when her sight and physical strength had almost failed, she wrote a letter setting out clearly and concisely all details for the next function of the Peace Group of which she was the President."

The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."

"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

"Royals may be best known for a bad punt he kicked in the 1993 NFL season AFC wildcard game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs on January 8, 1994. Near the end of the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading Kansas City by seven points, Royals failed to direct a punt towards a sideline, and instead, punted the ball forward directly towards the line of scrimmage. The punt was blocked and recovered by Kansas City. With 1:43 remaining in the fourth quarter and on 4th down, Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana threw a touchdown pass to receiver Tim Barnett. The ensuing PAT tied the game which then went into sudden death overtime.

"Shepperd's Dell is a small canyon in the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon, located at"
which is less than one-third mile (500 m) southeast of Rooster Rock State Park.
"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game."
"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."
"To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high-capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64."
Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."
"The distinction with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do not conform to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers."

"Brent W. Jeffs is an author, advocate, and member of the influential Jeffs family in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church)."
"Jeffs wrote the memoir ""Lost Boy"" along with author Maia Szalavitz, which was released on May 19, 2009. The book is a depiction of life within the FLDS Church and his ostracism from the organization at a young age. The title of the book comes from the term ""the lost boys"", which refers to the many young men expelled from the FLDS Church. Jeffs is a grandson to FLDS ""prophet"" Rulon Jeffs, nephew to imprisoned FLDS ""prophet"" Warren Jeffs and Lyle Jeffs, and his mother is the daughter of another non-FLDS ""prophet"" as well."
"Jeffs was born to Ward Jeffs, son of Rulon Jeffs. Ward had three wives, two of whom were sisters. Between these marriages, Brent had nineteen siblings. Ward eventually left the church, leaving Brent in the FLDS community per Brent's request. Eventually, Brent left the compound and moved into a small apartment with four of his older brothers, where they experimented with alcohol, drug use and partying."
"In 2004 Jeffs named Warren Jeffs as the perpetrator in a civil lawsuit seeking damages for sexual abuse he had suffered as a boy. ""Lost Boy"" depicts much of the sexual abuse that was inflicted upon him beginning at ages 5 or 6. The memoir also includes abuse from Warren's brothers and other family members."
"Jeffs has appeared on the NPR radio show, ""Fresh Air"", hosted by interviewer Teri Gross, the television show ""Polygamy: What Love Is This?"", ""Hannity"" and ""Dr. Phil"", with each appearance having to do with the FLDS and polygamy. In each appearance Jeffs discusses the dangers of the FLDS lifestyle and abuse from Warren Jeffs and other influential FLDS Church leaders."
"Since releasing his memoir, Jeffs has married and had a daughter. They live in Salt Lake City, Utah."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."
"In 1959 BTM merged with former rival Powers-Samas to become International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT). ICT later became part of ICL (International Computers Limited), which was later taken over by Fujitsu."

Denizen is an action computer game published by Players Software in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum.
"""Denizen"" is a science-fiction action flip-screen maze game, with a top-down perspective. The player controls a marine, with the aim of detonating twenty explosive bolts on each of three levels. The marine is armed with a rifle and is initially supplied with 99 bullets. The player can only move orthogonally, in half-tile steps. Each screen may contain one or more enemies, who move toward the marine in a straight line until they reach an obstacle. The enemies attack the player merely by contact, draining the character's health in a manner similar to ""Gauntlet"". Each enemy requires two bullets to destroy."
"Health is regenerated by returning to the marine's start point on each level. If he is out of ammunition, this also supplies him with a single bullet. Items that can be collected include single-use keycards to open locked doors, ammunition, and a torch which allows better vision in dark areas."
"""Denizen"" received poor reviews, with criticism being levelled at the slow character movement. The weapon firing mechanism was a particular complaint; ""The self-loading 'Quick Kill' rifle... is anything but quick"", ""[The rifle] acts in the manner of an aerosol gun, two slow puffs and off goes yer fly"". The gameplay itself was described as a ""dull maze plod"" with unresponsive and repetitive action."

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

"Lincoln was born on 5 May 1892 in Denver, Colorado."
"As a teenager working at the Colorado Museum of Natural History in 1909, Lincoln learned to prepare specimens from Alexander Wetmore (who was then a student working at the museum) and L. J. Hershey, the museum's Curator of Ornithology. Lincoln's interest in birds continued to develop, and he eventually went on to succeed Hershey as curator in 1913, a post which he held until 1920. He took time out in 1918–1919 to serve as pigeon expert in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The professional relationship with Wetmore would continue: the two scientists took field trips together in Washington and Hispaniola and co-wrote eight publications."
"In 1920, Lincoln joined the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (at the time, a unit of the United States Department of Agriculture, and now part of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ) and was given the task of organizing and expanding the bird banding program nationwide. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 had established federal responsibility for migratory birds; the result was that the North American Bird Banding Program took the place of earlier smaller-scale efforts by individuals and the short-lived American Bird Banding Association. During the period of his tenure, 1920–1946, Lincoln was highly influential: he improved methods for trapping and banding, developed record-keeping procedures, recruited banders, fostered international cooperation, and promoted banding as a tool for research and wildlife management. He proposed a means to estimate the continent-wide population size of a bird species, using reports from hunters and counting ""returns"" (birds killed that are wearing bands); this metric became known as the Lincoln index. He developed the flyway concept, a key idea in the management and regulation of hunting of migratory birds."
Lincoln joined the American Ornithologists' Union in 1910 and was elected a Fellow of the organization in 1934.
"Lincoln died on 16 September 1960 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
"Lincoln received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in 1956; in 1957, the Department of the Interior recognized him with its Distinguished Service Award."

"Axelrod's rainbowfish (""Chilatherina axelrodi"") is a species of rainbowfish in the subfamily Melanotaeniinae. It is found in Papua New Guinea in the Yungkiri stream in the north western part of that nation. Typically its preferred habitat is a narrow stream with gentle moving, cloudy water surrounded by lush rainforest."
"The males of Axelrod's rainbowfish are bluish-grey to greenish-brown in colour on the dorsal part of their body and silvery-grey to whitish on the ventral part. There are around 10 short bars along the centre of flanks, spaced roughly two scales apart and these merge to form a more or less solid blackish stripe along the caudal peduncle. The lower part of the body has about 6-10 faint dusky bars with those on side of abdomen more obvious than the others. On the back and upper flanks there are a number of bluish stripes while the lower part of the body is marked with faint yellow stripes which border each longitudinal scale row. The dorsal, anal and pelvic fins are yellowish while the remaining fins are translucent. The females are less colourful than the malesd and are a silvery colour with no markings. The males are larger and have deeper bodies than the females. The males can gorw to a maximum standard length of while the females are normally less than . There are 6-8 spines in the dorsal fins and 113 soft rays, there is a single spine in the anal fin with 19-24 soft rays"
Axelrod's rainbowfish is only known to occur in the Yungkiri Stream in the Bewani Mountains of Sandaun Province in north western Papua New Guinea.
"Axelrod's rainbowfish live in a small, narrow rainforest streams where they have been recorded around aquatic vegetation and among submerged logs and branches in slightly turbid water. The spawning season runs from October to January, each female laying between 50 and 150 eggs in batches over several days."
"Axelrod's rainbowfish was described in 1979 by Gerald R. Allen, Allen named the species after Herbert R. Axelrod (1927-2017), a publisher of books about pets, who gave financial aid to Allen's 1979 expedition to New Guinea."

"In geometry, the truncated great icosahedron (or great truncated icosahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is given a Schläfli symbol t{3,5/2} or t{3,5/2} as a truncated great icosahedron."
"Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a ""truncated great icosahedron"" centered at the origin are all the even permutations of"

This polyhedron is the truncation of the great icosahedron:
"The truncated ""great stellated dodecahedron"" is a degenerate polyhedron, with 20 triangular faces from the truncated vertices, and 12 (hidden) pentagonal faces as truncations of the original pentagram faces, the latter forming a great dodecahedron inscribed within and sharing the edges of the icosahedron."

"Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 110th Street station."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"In 2002, it was announced that 110th Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations."
"This station has two side platforms and three tracks, the center one being an unused express track. The southbound local track is technically known as BB1 and the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for chaining purposes along the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street. Although it cannot be accessed at Cathedral Parkway–110th Street, the center track is designated as M. These designations are rarely, if ever, used in ordinary conversation."
"This is the closest station to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, located one block east."

"Bunge Church () is a medieval church in Bunge on the Swedish island of Gotland. The church seen today was largely built during the 14th century and is in a High Gothic style typical for churches on Gotland. Inside, the church is richly decorated with medieval frescos, including depictions of medieval knights whose significance remain contested. Bunge Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden)."
"Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows."
"The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with frescos depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The frescos and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an ""Ordensburg"" (albeit on a small scale)."
The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
"The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building."
"The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with frescos executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion. A single remaining painted glass window remains, a baptismal font from the 13th century and an oddity: a mite box in stone, which is signed by the stonemason in runes, ""Lafrans made this stone""."

Essay Topic:
"“Zi Mo (子莫) holds on to the middle… Holding on to the middle is closer to being right, but to do this without the proper measure is not different from holding to one extreme.”"
1. Pòtí:
"Mencius’ contemporary Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviation of heterodox teachings, but did not realize that he himself fell into deviation."
2. Chéngtí:
"The fact is, the middle is defined as “not deviant,” and the correct application of the middle is the proper measure. Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviant ways of Yang Zi (楊子) and Mo Zi (墨子), but did not know the proper measure, so this was but another deviation. This was the standard Mencius used to repudiate his error and to establish our way."
3. Qǐjiǎng:
"To elaborate, for our Way is the principal one, but the manifestations are many; egoism and indiscriminate love certainly deviate from the Way. And our way uses the one principle to join together the many, but those who hold on to egoism or indiscriminate love are certainly holding on to an extreme which leads nowhere. Thus there was Zi Mo who understood the errors of Yang Zi and Mo Zi, and thereupon mediated between the two in order to grasp the middle course."
4. Qǐgǔ:
"Zi Mo would probably say, I cannot bear to be like Yang Zi, who cut off all ties with others in a niggardly fashion; I simply stop short of loving indiscriminately."
I have not time to be like Mo Zi who joyfully sacrifices himself for others: I simply stop short of being an egoist.
"Because one rejects egoism, one may be thought to be escaping from the error of Yang Zi and heading towards benevolence."
"Because one rejects indiscriminate love, one may be thought to be escaping for the error of Mo Zi and heading towards righteousness."

= = = Samuel Richardson (Baptist) = = =
"Samuel Richardson (fl. 1646) was an English layman and religious controversialist of the 1640s and 1650s, of Baptist views."
"From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping."
"Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of ""Lord Protector"", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate."
"Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect."
"Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: ""We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough"", Richardson notes."
"Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God’s work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by “faith” simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of “interest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ”."
"Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification:"
"“[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ…yet these are no means of our salvation.”"
"Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism."
Richardson wrote:
"To Richardson have also been ascribed tentatively ""An exact and full Relation of all the Proceedings between the Cavaliers and the Northamptonshire Forces at Banbury"", January 1643–4, signed R. S.; ""The King's March with the Scots, and a List of the 3 Lords, … that submit to the Parliament upon the surrender of Newark"", London, May 1646; and ""Oxford agreed to be surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax"", London, June 1646."

= = = Siege of Ctesiphon (629) = = =
"The Siege of Ctesiphon took place on 27 April 629 between the forces of Shahrbaraz and Ardashir III. Shahrbaraz managed to capture Ctesiphon with a small force, revealing to all the weakness of the Sasanian Empire."
"In 602, the last Byzantine-Sasanian war began; it was the most devastating of the series of wars fought between the two empires. In 618, Khosrau II sent Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt; one year later the Sasanians managed to capture Alexandria, the capital of Byzantine Egypt. After the fall of Alexandria, the Sasanians gradually extended their rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands."
"Egypt would remain in Sasanian hands for 10 years, run by general Shahrbaraz from Alexandria. As the new Roman emperor, Heraclius, reversed the tide and defeated Khosrau II, Shahrbaraz was ordered to evacuate the province, but refused. In the end, Heraclius, trying both to recover Egypt and to sow disunion amongst the Iranians, offered to help Shahrbaraz seize the Sasanian throne for himself. An agreement was reached, and in the spring of 629, the Sasanian troops began leaving Egypt."
"Luckily for Shahrbaraz, a civil war began in 628 that divided the resources of the Sasanian Empire, and a devastating plague in the western provinces killed half of the population along with Kavadh II, weakening the empire. Shahrbaraz marched towards Ctesiphon with 6,000 men, besieged it and then captured it, betraying the Sasanian nobles and killing many of them, including two notable ones named Ardabīl and Mah-Adhur Gushnasp."
"After capturing Ctesiphon, Shahrbaraz killed Ardashir III and took the throne for himself. However, his reign did not last long, because he was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days, and two daughters of Khosrau II reigned in succession."

"Der Philosophische Arzt is a medical publication published in the late 18th century by Melchior Adam Weikard, a prominent German physician and philosopher to the Russian Empress, Catherine II."
"The first edition of ""Der Philosophische Arzt"" was first published in 1775, but perhaps as early as 1770. It was initially published anonymously as was the second edition, though it was widely believed that Weikard was the author. The reason for doing so is unclear but was probably due to anticipated critical reactions to its publication from several sources. A principal one was the Prince-Bishop of Fulda, to whom Weikard served as physician and in a Catholic region where Weikard worked as a spa doctor being supported by the state. According to Otto Schmitt's biography of Weikard published in 1970, the reaction of organized religion to the publication of his textbook was widespread condemnation. This was likely due to his attacks in the textbook on various religious practices for curing medical illnesses. According to Schmidt, the attacks against Weikard continued throughout his career but his patron, Prince Heinrich von Bibra, maintained an amicable relationship with him and supported him financially late in his career despite many people who criticized the Prince for doing so."

"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968."
"Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor."
"The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s."

= = = Syöksy-class motor torpedo boat = = =
"The ""Syöksy""-class motor torpedo boats () was a series of four British Thornycroft type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1928 by the John Thornycroft & Co. shipyard in Woolton, UK. The vessels saw service in World War II. The Thornycroft type released its torpedoes by dropping them from rails in the aft. The ship then had to steer away from the torpedoes path, a manoeuvre that could be quite tricky in the close waters of the Gulf of Finland."
"In 1942, the vessels received individual identification symbols on their superstructures. ""Nuoli"" had the ace of hearts, ""Vinha"" the ace of clubs, ""Syöksy"" the ace of diamonds, and ""Raju"" the ace of spades."
"On 6 July 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" sortied to intercept a convoy of three sailing ships headed for Hanko. In heavy seas the torpedoes did not function reliably and the boats could not hit their targets. Instead ""Syöksy"" dashed past the lead ship and dropped its depth charges in front of it which exploded and sank the sailing ship. Both Finnish motor torpedo boats escaped unharmed before escorting Soviet ships could respond."
"On the night of 19 and 20 July 1941 Finnish motor torpedo boats were patrolling of the coast of Estonia when a Soviet destroyer opened fire on them. ""Vinha"" was damaged and unable to move but Finns were able to tow it to safety while ""Syöksy"" made repeated torpedo runs towards the destroyer drawing its fire and distracting it."
"On 1 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" and ""Vinha"" were patrolling south of the Beryozovye Islands when they came across a pair of Soviet freighters. ""Syöksy"" torpedoed and sank the lead merchant (SS ""Meero"", 1,866 tons)."
"On 22 September 1941 ""Syöksy"" sank the Soviet minehunter ""T-41"" (""Kirov"") east of Gogland while it was patrolling near the island with ""Vinha""."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Nuoli"" participated in the sinking of a Soviet minehunter, though it was a torpedo from ""Sisu"" that sank the target."
"""Syöksy"", ""Vinha"" and , as well as a minelaying KM boat participated in the attack on the harbour of Lavansaari on 18 November 1942. ""Syöksy"" managed to torpedo the (1,760 tons), which sank."
= = = Microsoft Network Monitor = = =
"Microsoft Network Monitor is a deprecated packet analyzer. It enables capturing, viewing, and analyzing network data and deciphering network protocols. It can be used to troubleshoot network problems and applications on the network. Microsoft Network Monitor 1.0 (codenamed ""Bloodhound"") was originally designed and developed by Raymond Patch, a transport protocol and network adapter device driver engineer on the Microsoft LAN Manager development team."
Network Monitor was replaced by Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA was discontinued in 2019).
"The LAN Manager development team had one shared hardware-based analyzer at the time. Netmon was conceived when the hardware analyzer was taken during a test to reproduce a networking bug, and the first Windows prototype was coded over the Christmas holiday. The first 4 bytes of the Netmon capture file format were used to validate the file. The values were 'RTSS' for Ray, Tom, Steve, and Steve - the first four members of the team. The code was originally written for OS/2 and had no user interface; a symbol was placed in the device driver where the packet buffers were kept so received data could be dumped in hex from within the kernel debugger."
"Netmon caused a bit of a stir for Microsoft IT since networks and e-mail were not encrypted at the time. Only a few software engineers had access to hardware analyzers due to their cost, but with Netmon many engineers around the company had access to network traffic for free. At the request of Microsoft IT, two simple identification features were added - a non-cryptographic password and an identification protocol named the Bloodhound-Oriented Network Entity (BONE) (created and named by Raymond Patch as a play on the codename ""Bloodhound"")."

"described below prior to final passage."" The announcement listed several reasons that the President supported the bill: elimination of the direct payments system; consolidation and streamlining of conservation assistance; and the inclusion of funding for bioenergy programs. The statement criticized the bill for not adopting all of the Administration's previous proposals for achieving crop insurance and commodity program savings and objected to any cuts at all to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)."
"Senator Debbie Stabenow argued in favor of the bill because it both reduced the deficit and supported ""16 million people who depend on agriculture for their jobs""."
The bill was opposed by groups focusing on hunger due to its reduction in spending on food stamps. It was also criticized by groups such as the Heritage Foundation for including a system of crop insurance that were less about helping farmers in the event of a true disaster and more of an income support system.
Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized the bill for containing a catfish inspection program that he believes duplicates one that is already conducted by the Food and Drug Administration.

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.

One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine."
"The straight-line linkage confines the point ""P"" – the midpoint on the link ""L"" – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (""L"", ""L"", ""L"", and ""L"" are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point ""P"" deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are"
"Point P is in the middle of ""L"". This relationship assures that the link ""L"" lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel."
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:
"It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,"
"and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point ""P""."
"The motion of the linkage can be constrained to an input angle that may be changed through velocities, forces, etc. The input angles can be either link ""L"" with the horizontal or link ""L"" with the horizontal. Regardless of the input angle, it is possible to compute the motion of two end-points for link ""L"" that we will name A and B, and the middle point P."

"General Sir Arthur James Lyon Fremantle (11 November 1835 – 25 September 1901) was a British Army officer and a notable British witness to the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. Whilst holding the rank of ""Captain and Lieutenant Colonel"" he spent three months (from 2 April until 16 July 1863) in North America, travelling through parts of the Confederate States of America and the Union. Contrary to popular belief, Colonel Fremantle was not an official representative of the United Kingdom; instead, he was something of a tourist."
"Fremantle was born into a distinguished military family; his father, Lieutenant-General John Fremantle, had commanded a battalion of the Coldstream Guards, and had served during the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, as well as acting as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke during the abortive British invasion of Buenos Aires in 1807. Arthur's middle name, Lyon, came from his mother, Agnes Lyon. He was called ""Arthur"" after the Duke of Wellington, who had been the first witness at his parents' wedding in 1829."
"After his graduation from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Arthur Fremantle was commissioned into the British Army in 1852, serving firstly as an ensign in the 70th Foot, before being transferred to the 52nd Foot almost immediately thereafter. The following year, Fremantle became ensign and lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards, and continued to receive promotions until, in 1860, at the age of 25, he held the rank of captain of his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army."
"The same year, Fremantle was appointed to the position of assistant military secretary at Gibraltar under Governor William John Codrington. In January 1862, the Confederate commerce raider CSS ""Sumter"", pursued by the Union Navy, arrived in port. The ship's commander, Raphael Semmes, sought to have his ship repaired and refitted, although ultimately the ""Sumter"" was sold and its crew transferred to the newly constructed CSS ""Alabama"". Sometime in early 1862, the young British captain met the flamboyant Confederate captain, and was inspired by Semmes' tales of blockade running and combat on the high seas."
"Like many other officers of his generation, including Lieutenant Colonel Garnet Wolseley, Fremantle had a considerable interest in the American Civil War. Unlike most of the others, however, he decided to take a tour of the South, and applied for a leave of absence in 1863. By his own admission, his initial sympathies lay with the Union, due to his natural distaste for slavery. But as stated in his own book, in the Preface:"
"On 2 March 1863, Captain and Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle left England on board the mail steamer ""Atrato""."

= = = Affine gauge theory = = =
"Affine gauge theory is classical gauge theory where gauge fields are affine connections on the tangent bundle over a smooth manifold formula_1. For instance, these are gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media when formula_2, the generalization of metric-affine gravitation theory when formula_1 is a world manifold and, in particular, gauge theory of the fifth force."
"Being a vector bundle, the tangent bundle formula_4 of an formula_5-dimensional manifold formula_1 admits a natural structure of an affine bundle formula_7, called the ""affine tangent bundle"", possessing bundle atlases with affine transition functions. It is associated to a principal bundle formula_8 of affine frames in tangent space over formula_1, whose structure group is a general affine group formula_10."
"The tangent bundle formula_4 is associated to a principal linear frame bundle formula_12, whose structure group is a general linear group formula_13. This is a subgroup of formula_10 so that the latter is a semidirect product of formula_13 and a group formula_16 of translations."
There is the canonical imbedding of formula_12 to formula_8 onto a reduced principal subbundle which corresponds to the canonical structure of a vector bundle formula_4 as the affine one.
Given linear bundle coordinates
"on the tangent bundle formula_4, the affine tangent bundle can be provided with affine bundle coordinates"
"and, in particular, with the linear coordinates (1)."
"Stuart married Kerri McKeehan, sister of TobyMac, in 1995. The two later divorced."
Stuart has visited Haiti consistently to help with missionary efforts. He started the Hands and Feet Project in 2004 along with Audio Adrenaline.
"On January 12, 2010, Mark, his parents (Drex and Jo), and his wife Aegis were working at the Hands and Feet Project in Jacmel, Haiti when the earthquake struck Port-au-Prince. None at the Project were injured by the quake, and Mark was able to get the word out about the plight of the residents of Jacmel via multiple Skype interviews with media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC and BBC, among others. He assisted with relief efforts in Jacmel until he returned to the U.S. on January 22, when he continued to assist by raising funds through continued coordination of relief efforts and organization of benefit concerts."
= = = Great cubicuboctahedron = = =
"In geometry, the great cubicuboctahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U."
"It shares the vertex arrangement with the convex truncated cube and two other nonconvex uniform polyhedra. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron (having the triangular faces and 6 square faces in common), and with the great rhombihexahedron (having the octagrammic faces in common)."
The great hexacronic icositetrahedron (or great lanceal disdodecahedron) is the dual of the great cubicuboctahedron.
= = = Dodecadodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the dodecadodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is the rectification of the great dodecahedron (and that of its dual, the small stellated dodecahedron). It was discovered independently by , and ."
"The edges of this model form 10 central hexagons, and projected onto a sphere, represent 10 great circles. These 10, along with the great circles from projections of two other polyhedra, form the 31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron used in construction of geodesic domes."
"It has four Wythoff constructions between four Schwarz triangle families: 2 | 5 5/2, 2 | 5 5/3, 2 | 5/2 5/4, 2 | 5/3 5/4, but represent identical results. Similarly it can be given four extended Schläfli symbols: r{5/2,5}, r{5/3,5}, r{5/2,5/4}, and r{5/3,5/4} or as Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams: , , , and ."
A shape with the same exterior appearance as the dodecadodecahedron can be constructed by folding up these nets:
"12 pentagrams and 20 rhombic clusters are necessary. However, this construction replaces the crossing pentagonal faces of the dodecadodecahedron with non-crossing sets of rhombi, so it does not produce the same internal structure."
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the small dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagrammic faces in common), and with the great dodecahemicosahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common)."
This polyhedron can be considered a rectified great dodecahedron. It is center of a truncation sequence between a small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron:
"The truncated small stellated dodecahedron looks like a dodecahedron on the surface, but it has 24 faces: 12 pentagons from the truncated vertices and 12 overlapping as (truncated pentagrams). The truncation of the dodecadodecahedron itself is not uniform and attempting to make it uniform results in a degenerate polyhedron (that looks like a small rhombidodecahedron with {10/2} polygons filling up the dodecahedral set of holes), but it has a uniform quasitruncation, the truncated dodecadodecahedron."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-4 pentagonal tiling, by distorting the pentagrams back into regular pentagons. As such, it is topologically a regular polyhedron of index two:"
The colours in the above image correspond to the red pentagrams and yellow pentagons of the dodecadodecahedron at the top of this article.

The medial rhombic triacontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the dodecadodecahedron. It has 30 intersecting rhombic faces.
It can also be called the small stellated triacontahedron.
"The ""medial rhombic triacontahedron"" is a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron, which is the dual of the icosidodecahedron, the convex hull of the dodecadodecahedron (dual to the original medial rhombic triacontahedron)."
"It is topologically equivalent to a quotient space of the hyperbolic order-5 square tiling, by distorting the rhombi into squares. As such, it is topologically a regular polyhedron of index two:"
"Note that the order-5 square tiling is dual to the order-4 pentagonal tiling, and a quotient space of the order-4 pentagonal tiling is topologically equivalent to the dual of the medial rhombic triacontahedron, the dodecadodecahedron."

= = = Ribbon category = = =
"In mathematics, a ribbon category, also called a tortile category, is a particular type of braided monoidal category."
"A monoidal category formula_1 is, loosely speaking, a category equipped with a notion resembling the tensor product (of vector spaces, say). That is, for any two objects formula_2, there is an object formula_3. The assignment formula_4 is supposed to be functorial and needs to require a number of further properties such as a unit object 1 and an associativity isomorphism. Such a category is called braided if there are isomorphisms"
"A braided monoidal category is called a ribbon category if the category is left rigid and has a family of ""twists"". The former means that for each object formula_6 there is another object (called the left dual), formula_7, with maps"
such that the compositions
"equals the identity of formula_7, and similarly with formula_6. The twists are maps"
such that
"To be a ribbon category, the duals have to be compatible with the braiding and the twists in a certain way."
"An example is the category of projective modules over a commutative ring. In this category, the monoidal structure is the tensor product, the dual object is the dual in the sense of (linear) algebra, which is again projective. The twists in this case are the identity maps. A more sophisticated example of a ribbon category are finite-dimensional representations of a quantum group."
The name ribbon category is motivated by a graphical depiction of morphisms.
A strongly ribbon category is a ribbon category C equipped with a dagger structure such that the functor †: C → C coherently preserves the ribbon structure.
