But do you think they'll load the thing on the joints?
Or
We'll probably have to split it  I would think.
Oh excuse me !
But it shouldn't be too much should it?
No.
"We eve , we can dig them up and fix them, really, there's real problem getting anybody in."
So why have the three trees gotta come down?
What three trees are they?
Well those that are right next to the  the ones growing up  between the two bedrooms.
Ah!
"Oh that, that one"
The big one.
the big one?
The big one on the back.
Yeah.
"Oh tha , we need that anyway."
Tha that one's actually  another .
Oh brilliant!
Then we got one round the corner in the patio area.
Oh no!
Not that big one?
Yeah.
Oh!
"But it's right up against the house, it's gotta come down."
tt.
I bet next door are gonna get bitchy aren't they?
Well  possibly.
Then we'll erm
Why's it gotta come down?
Does it have to?
And you say they're nothing to do with Mark
No.
?
It's unbelievable isn't it?
Isn't it Yeah.
Unless it's Smith in Cypriot or something .
Don't know.
Don't think she's Cypriot.
None of them sound Cypriot but
So what's his wife teach then?
English.
We have him for history and her for English.
And her for English?
Yo!
Yeah.
Mm.
"She's the one we did our Geoffrey Chaucer project, project with."
I always feel guilty passing Mike's house.
"We really should sort of take him to football, don't you?"
But
they are.
I don't think he's I don't think he's interested as you is he really?
"No, nowhere near."
But  he's probably not there.
"He's probably at a party or something like that, or"
Yeah.
"I don't think he's got any lack of things to do, has he?"
Really?
No.
He never seems to have any homework to do though.
"all those Christmas trees in that lorry, look."
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't know why?
Unless it's Euro or international  and then it's in metres.
"What are you refer , what are you referring to that one, that, what does that"
That's for loading containers?
That's what you ship in .
Yeah that's for international you see.
Oh right.
It's a different one.
I didn't realize I was
No.
international.
No.
It's not the same.
That's what containers do don't they?
They seal containers and export it to different er  ratio.
"But the cubic idea is the same, but it's six point six  cu , kilos per cubic foot."
So a metre would be  about three  it's a cubic metre.
We'll work on that one.
"Gotta be nine ,"
Nine.
nine
Nine.
cubic metres in a
metres
yard.
"About the same sa , in ten."
Mm.
It's about the same.
What I can't understand is
Not a ton.
"is why we mix, why we mix the measures."
Okay.
First.
Can I see the other one?
That you won't let me see!
No!
Why not!
I said not!
Great!
"So if I wrote a letter  and wouldn't let you see it, how would you feel?"
I wouldn't feel anything cos I'm not really bothered!
What if it's about you as well?
Well if you write something about me  you write something about me!
"And if I don't let you see it, I'm dead?"
Yeah.
You're clever!
"Very, very clever!"
Well you think you are!
"Well, if you think, you think!"
Do you know that's ?
Is it?
Well  I've not too bothered  if you found everything.
No.
Who?
As long as you got on well.
Really get into rather than I wouldn't take all that much notice of it.
Would you?
No.
"It's funny, in a bit, in a way."
Yeah.
Yo yo it was sort of like  he got  he got hit on the  got run over
Knocked down.
Oh!
Three hundred and eighty for third
Our Connie's were five hundred and seventy.
Now it's gone up to five hundred and seventy because that accident.
"I mean, when you look at it, it's for a third party fire and theft."
"Christ, that's gonna be a thousand pounds on a full comprehensive, just about."
I know.
I'm still
Are ya.
"Well, I I I'll promise not to fondle."
need to tell her.
"Connie  get in touch with me again, I told her that."
I don't know.
Tell the truth innit.
Aye.
How it goes.
He wouldn't be be able to keep that promise if he'd tried.
He won't promise.
Who
"No, I don't."
I be  You get to walk by yourself
See that piece in free press about
No.
It's a big piece.
Give ya mummy that that free press.
What.
Give mummy that free press
That paper.
one.
Yeah
Er  for me eyes.
It's only one like you had for
He does make a lot of dust.
That just proves what you already know.
"Right dad, I'll show you something else."
No.
I was going to do more
"But I wa I want to show you something, that's all."
Go on then.
"Nine, fifty six  square root."
Er
Who taught you that?
"Well, I lis no one."
It's Mrs  said to Mark
Just a minute.
"he, he, he was getting the  controls wrong."
He pressed square root instead of equals .
Yes.
And so you've discovered
Eh!
"the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine, seven nine, five, eight nine."
But do you know what square root means?
What?
Well the square root of a number
Yes.
is the number which if multiplied by itself
Yes.
gives you back the number you started with.
"Take, for , the easiest one is  four."
The square root of four is two.
Try it on your machine.
Right.
What do I press?
"Four  four, square root  and it gives you two."
Because two times two  gives you four.
You'll have a lot of a headache by the time I've finished.
Now would I?
I don't play music loud.
There you go.
Thank you.
I couldn't have done that myself.
I'm only helping.
If you don't want any help just
"Alright, okay, fair enough, alright?"
Thank you.
You can say it as loud as you like Jo.
"I know, I don't want to say it as loud as I like."
"Go on, you shout it."
open the door.
There we are  there's no-one in there.
It wasn't exactly a joke was it now Andy?
It didn't make anybody laugh  because it was funny
You both laughed when I  shut the door.
No it's just cos you're a twat
Yes it's   vagina.
We know.
See the tufts of hair spring out  and the clitoris bulge.
Shut up.
No I know but
It should be quite
What are you looking at him like that for?
What?
That  to you dunnit?
What?
No.
listen to it.
"Yeah, it's dynamic."
It looks better for going around most of the edges and going over the grass.
The back bed looks particularly good.
The one
It does.
by the
Yes.
Well I mean it was a lot
it was a lot of edging to do.
I mean it was just the back  though.
Now if you'll excuse me a moment.
I'll just watch the last few laps.
How many laps are there to go?
That .
Look.
Dad!
Yes love.
Come here.
"No I'm, just got sitting down again."
Yo go on you can tell me this joke and then you can finish.
But it isn't a joke.
Alright.
Well tell me whatever it is.
"No it's er, mum, shall I finish this?"
Mm mm.
All my carrots I'm eating.
"I would rather you ate your vegetables, yes, rather than the chicken please."
But mum  I
Yes?
I won't go hungry.
Well I hope you won't.
"It's down, down to those two cos of the Grand Prix on."
Those two do like watching it don't they?
Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
"Yeah, I just press this one."
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
"Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six."
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
"What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be."
"Don't, don't press the button."
Six.
Er er
"What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?"
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
"I don six, six."
It's three.
No.
we'll only be briefing the interview staff
That's right.
and accounts staff.
Yeah.
So we're only talking about half a dozen
Well  I think it's slightly more.
Well eight or ten or something isn't it?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks .
"Yeah you're talking about a dozen people, something like that aren't you?"
I mean for that er
Well if necessary we can bring them into here.
Yeah.
Half a dozen and half a dozen
Yeah.
"That's, I can't see that being a problem, that should be okay ."
Have you briefed  before?
Yeah.
Well Mike comes out.
Mike shows his face doesn't he?
Well he did for the Wigan one.
I did it for the erm Ormskirk one
Yeah.
That was okay wasn't it?
We did that in two shifts didn't we?
Two days.
Yeah.
Two mornings.
We had a hell of a lot of staff though didn't we?
"That was a, we did that in the conference room downstairs."
Mm.
They won again!
Oh Swindon slipped again.
"They should have won that, against Grimsby."
"That is so unlucky, Ian."
Will they be home by now?
"Eight o'clock, they're hoping to get home."
Er yeah I bet
Four nil .
Still.
Poor kids.
Oh I feel sorry for them.
Yeah.
You get used to it if you support Palace but
Shut it!
"I was just gonna say, what games have we lost?"
"We are getting used to it, I mean there was a coup , a sea , last season we had"
Five one you lost not long ago!
"Yeah but I mean  last season we hardly, Paulie and I hardly ever used to come home having lost."
Now we're starting to get used to it.
Now you  lot.
"What have we lost at home, Paulie, this season?"
Come on.
A lot.
Arsenal.
Yes.
Man United.
Is that all?
Oh and you lost
No hang on.
That's the two we've seen.
Have we lost any others?
"Oh well we can't complain then, only two."
"Sh , what she said to me"
you could probably save me reading wouldn't it?
"Yeah the doing er, say four, in this area but I   There were three."
Some down in the Midlands.
I think that's the same isn't it ?
And we selected all intelligent looking ones.
Yeah but
Bar one!
showed him.
So they made a mistake filling it in?
"Anyway, she"
So we've still got the
Anyway he said so he couldn't do it!
Well I'd only just brought it in the kitchen actually.
"Oh, I thought I'd give you a chance to put on your"
I don't care!
your posh accent.
"Ray, had it ."
wasn't just for me  I'd like to know him.
"You can,."
Careful!
"Totally, all the complications"
"and of course, they've been absolutely abnormal."
You still going on?
"Okay, it's on."
"No, not really ."
Wherever a   description of youth.
Well  where have you been today?
What is it?
What have you been doing?
Oh is it going?
It's good!
Good boy.
Look at this house.
Luxembourg there.
Oh that's nice isn't it?
Yeah.
Is that in the same village?
Yeah.
You can go the coach route can't you?
We wondered round the streets just taking photos.
You can go the coach route can't you?
"Yeah well  we was, we was gonna go down the west coast  go and see Rome and then down from there."
Yeah.
But the weather was terrible.
"I was driving through what, eighteen inches of water."
Yeah  when you go through Switzerland.
Yeah.
It seems to be following you.
Yeah well Switzerland weren't too bad cos the road surfaces are pretty good.
Yeah.
But in Italy there's no drainage.
Ooh.
"but on, on a motorway  brand new motorway, no lines"
Yeah.
"no white lines, nothing."
No?
about eighteen inches of water.
Right?
Cor!
And the cars are just  straight on.
"You know,"
Went round taking  photos of old and the new.
See this is the new stuff that's going up.
Three times three.
I don't know the answer!
Well look  three  three  and three.
So how many have you got?
Ten.
No!
Plonker !
You've got nine.
I'm just going
Anyway
to check.
"So, there you are."
"It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half."
Which isn't quite right.
"Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time."
That gets very difficult.
Right.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
"Right, I'll show you."
Ten  square root  is
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Right.
Eh eh.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You don't really need that information do you?
Well dad!
"So what, what, what sort of information do you need?"
Tt.
Counting information.
"Er er, like that."
You know how to do a seven.
Oh here's the tram bit.
"Let's fli turn up the sound  then we can    No you've done that backwards, it's seventeen not seventy one."
Here we go look.
Oh look Dave this is great!
Going  back to the old trams.
But how can they go through the towns?
"Well trams Dave  they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre."
Right.
Oh dear!
Don't watch this .
"The Olympics, not that far away."
Right.
Let's see.
Seven minus two is
Good.
Ah ah!
That's wrong.
Right.
I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on
I can.
Da David!
You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.
Remember how you do it.
Add the four to the three
I have.
and what do you get?
Eighteen!
No you don't.
"Well do it, do it the way on your fingers."
You've got thirteen plus four.
Any time?
some x-rays.
"Aye, any time after er I guess half past nine in the morning."
Right.
Just give it to the lassie and she'll put you through straight away.
Mhm.
Get your x-rays done and they'll send the results over to us in a week .
To just to out-patients that I go to
Aye.
Aye.
You know the first when you go in.
Ah just as you go in it's just er
First one on the right
"Right, aye."

And they'll check that out for you and we'll see what's happening but it's just in case there's any arthritis or anything like that that's
Aye.
"causing it, er or some dry rot setting in."
nice.
"Get it, get it organized, make it"
Okey-dokey.
organized dry rot.
Right thanks very much Dr .
Right?
Okay.
"Right but get your mum started on that, get her,"
"Get her up and going,."

"Right,"
"Many thinks, cheerio."

"Is that it, I don't want the veggies, grapes, pears, iceberg, toms, cress, I think that's the lot ."
Do you want a bag?.
"Well it wouldn't come amiss, though"
.
I'd hate to drop the tomatoes half way across the road.
I've already dropped .
You want to drop the tomatoes.
Oh it's fun .

Splat.
Part of the fun.
I always leave .
"Yeah, two eight one, that's about right."

No you're not supposed to put that on top of the grapes.
"Look dear, don't give him ."
You take the bag I'll take the money .
"No, I'll take the money, you take ."

Yes!
"They accost me in the street every time I walk  every time I walk down for money, they're"
Do you e
terrible!
Do you ever give them any money?
Of course I don't give them any money!
"Bearing in mind that you're rich enough to live in Surrey, and some people can't even afford a roof over their head don't you think you have a moral obligation towards these people?"
It's not my problem!
Yeah.
If they're stupid enough to be homeless!
Okay!

There doesn't seem to be a regional accent in this area does there?
"If you start going further towards Worcester, Worcestershire."
Into Worcester
The black country.
That area.

"Well, into Hailsowen"
Wales.
Mhm.
"places like that, then you would get an accent."

Yeah.
"You know, mutton dressed as lamb."

be here?
Oh we'll wonder shall we !
Oh well  come round and tell us!
Graphs.
important thing about graphs.
Erm.
Are they ?
"If there was an exam question which said sketch a graph of, where would the marks be found?"
What would you get marks for?
The axes.
"Okay, X and Y."
The  points
Which parti particular points?
Points given for  like co-ordinates.
"Erm let's , if they say sketch a graph,"
Right.
I they wouldn't give you any points.
Erm  directions.
Or shape of the line.
"Okay, general shape."
What would be the interesting parts of the shape?
Where it crosses through the X and Y axes.
"Okay, X and Y axes, anything else that might be an interesting point?"
Erm
.
Just checking
it was on at a reasonable volume.
Erm  end   or  anything else that might be interesting .
Mm.
Where it cross the X and Y erm
What's  where are the interesting points on that?
Er er er   there  .
"Okay and these are, these are fairly interesting as well."
Just .
"What's happening in the, near the, the limits?"
No
Thank you ma.
I'd nearly forgotten that.
I thought how on earth did I get myself
You plonker .
stuck in that one.
No ages ago you said you saw it.
We've been to the site haven't we?
Eh?
site.
The site is where the zoo is.
Oh I'm taking the phone up to phone my sister.
I'll stop the tape and
"clock, with the children."
We were Christmas shopping can you imagine
Six hours!
Awful.
So I said what have you got it all then?she's bought your present but she can't post it.
She said it's heavy
What is it?
so you might be getting something else.
It's quite a nice book.
So I
So she's gonna buy Simon either chocolates  dairy miniatures
Yeah.
or  a supply of chocolate miniatures.
Or a supply of caps for his gun.
Can you pull the curtain please Paul.
What a big supply?
Do you reckon that's quite a good idea?
Yeah.
A supply of caps for his gun.
I'd better get me timesheet out of
It's signed.
Oh it's signed.
Oh that's alright.
We don't want  bothering us do we?
Er where were we?
Mm?
Where were we?
We were drawing up plans.
It looks as though we're gonna be doing some extra survey work.
Mm.
Ah that's what I was saying  what
"Yeah, now"
detail on roundabouts.
right.
How much staff did we use?
"Can, can you   The erm  the Ormskirk"
"Oh, that's a pity."
track of methodology but
push to get Steve   today.
Well I left a message with his  saying
Were any of these four arm rou it's a five arm roundabout isn't it?
Were any of these four arm roundabouts?
Yes
We did that one didn't we?
We need to do these
Yeah that was  roundabout.
That was a six arm.
And we did  that one.
Yeah that was a
That's five arms isn't it?
five.
Supper.
Mhm.
Well  you can sit there and I'll read this list out to you.
And I will cringe.
For mummy's birthday  mummy would like  one  a gold locket  with a strong chain.
"Two, an eternity ring."
"Three, a hundred pounds worth of premium bonds."
Four
an epilator.
Do you know what one of them is?
Not an escalator?
"Oh, for taking the hairs off your legs?"
That's it.
Not a razor.
I've got a razor upstairs.
"Number five, a weekend away at a health farm."
"Oh  forget it, you can scrub that out straight away."
Number six  a large bright dried flower arrangement.
"Number seven, a large colourful brooch."
Not gold.
"Number eight, fountain pen."
Not a cartridge pen and not a set.
Just a fountain pen on its own.
Number nine is gold earrings.
"Stud type not drop type, studs."
Number ten's perfumes talcs and books.
Number eleven is an ornament from the jewellers.
"Number twelve, nightdress and negligee set."
"Number thirteen, no chocolates please."
And that's it.
Okay.
Pin that up on the board.
"It's gonna be about plus three, three plus."
Mm.
X squared.
So it'll be something like  X minus three X squared.
Mm.
if that's three.
Just touches.
Counts as two coincident roots.
Two which are the same.
So X equal three or X equal three.
Yeah.
sort that one out.
Erm don't forget these endpoints.
"If you have something like  Y equals X squared plus six   What would that look like, going as X goes from minus infinity through zero to plus infinity?"
What would be the interesting points on that?
Erm that'd be six.
"Y would be six,."
Mhm.
nought is six.
Erm
What about when X is about sort of point one.
Nought point one.
"What's Y equal to, roughly?"
Approximately.
"Just over six, six point"
s
two.
Six and a bit.
"Erm that's when it's minus nought point one four, or plus nought point one I went through the minus point first."
"It's still about six, six, six and a bit."
What about when X is sort of around infinity?
What does it approximate to?
November the ninth.
for the architects.
Like Hertfordshire architects
Yeah.
for example.
Do something basically have a
Yes
mailshot or ring them up or.
They're a pretty depressed lot at the moment

"Oh, this road."
Why?
Dunno some go off that way
"I mean, let, some people go up go off where?"
Where is it leading to?
Don't know.
I don't really know.
"What's all this, why does Meltis always have that stand of eighty, eighty years?"
But we don't even measure yet .
"I, I've yet, I've got a, a major job on my hands to reeducate people and bring in systems for much more accurate measurement of our work."
It's a very difficult job to measure is M and E.
Mm.
Well a lot of them are just
because
lump sums aren't they?
Well I mean a lot of it can't be measured you know?
Mm.
Mm.
"Hundreds of miles of, of cables"
Cables
on a site
Trunking
for example.
Yeah.
You know we we are not geared
S s
up to measure yet properly.
And we need to be.
Right.
So I'm saying we're wa way off what the procedures are currently saying.
A and all I'm saying is that and I rest my case
Mm.
is that
If we came to be audited
"procedures should be  what is happening, not what our aspirations are."
No.
I'm sorry.
Particularly when they're long way .
No.
"But, but when you're measuring something"
Is Derrick about?
Oh Derrick and Jo went up to London today
"I don't know something to do with erm sports I suppose well, or some entertainment I suppose"
Yum yum it's like
I suppose
"yesterday and it's worse, worse today than when I done it yesterday"
Got a  sports thing yet?
"No, where's, where's that then?"
"Go and pump, pump some weights today"
"You can go and do that can't you?,"
No
don't you?
"How can I do it, I've got to get in the building first"
Old Shaun name's on the old run machine today
yeah
That won't last will it?
"Mm, no"
"Sheila a housekeeper, Colin a"
"Neil unemployed, bird a pain in the butt , what sex is he anyway?"
What?
Is it male or female?
Female
Female
country
no
Do you want one?
"No thank you, have your shorts on then?"
I suppose sometimes they tape and there's nothing on there at all
Good oh
the tapes
What's that then?
got to erase forty five minutes before anyone says anything I suppose
"a back, a back rest"
"Made a big pile like, patch like that you know"
Yeah
"and another big one, ooh it was lovely"
"She'd been in a car accident, she was there, er broken pelvis"
Oh dear
"No, she was"
"Oh I, I"
"send me one, she made herself"
Yeah
"I, yes, oh"
She said would you like to me to get you
Are we going now?
chucking out time
chucking out time
"and that, I said I couldn't sit down and do that I said, I"
Ooh she won't be in here that long
"No,"
"you'll be, you'll be at home before the"
on your feet
I don't think I'll be that long
No
No
it just depends when it stops weeping you see
Oh
My doctor said
"Oh you know,"
"well I'm, I'm quite happy, never going out, never see the outside world except I go in the ambulance"
"Yeah, oh yeah you're happy"
Oh very happy
very good
"I don't worry about er, you know, what's going on outside"
fewer localities now.
This will be shorter.
I think we can easily put erm pits for daily life or how to be environmental.
And then
Oh a few tips.
Oh
With respect I really think it ought to be recycling and nothing else.
Mm.
"Well I just find these, I mean we had quite a few  now"
Cos recycling sort of comes into the tips for daily life as well though doesn't it.
It's part of it.
Like protecting  people don't just save bottles they save their glass jars
seem to be patronizing people when really you just want to give information.
as well.
People don't always think of.
Yeah.
"Re-using things, re-using things is almost the same  as recycling isn't it?"
Re-use?
Yes.
Yeah!
I suppose it's I mean
Well it is really isn't it?
re-using is better than recycling.
Yeah.
Erm.
So.
Erm I take
So it
"Reduce or re-use, recycling?"
Has anybody got a con
punchlines are much better than sort of er  .
Because people'll read those.
It hasn't actually happened.
Yes.
"You're, you're implementing a procedure here that doesn't exist, is what Jim's saying."
You're implementing a procedure
Within B E S.
which says you're gonna do this
Right?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No.
It doesn't say that.
This procedure should say you do this.
That's what we're doing at the moment.
Right.
he's quite right in saying
book is an instruction.
Yeah.
And Jim's
"quite right in saying, it does not happen."
But it's not the first time that a procedure's
Finished.
come out early.
So you've implemented a procedure for wh which you haven't set up you haven't even looked at the resource information
but can be briefed
We are introducing a procedure.
Yes.
And in order to c come in and say
like that?
No.
why don't you do this?
"And I could say well I, I've never done this."
"I can't do this, and Q S is not geared up to do it."
Eh?
Er one pound twenty
Bloody hell
I just get it settled then I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
I've been trying that for me stomach since I've came back
So you're saying
sorry
"no, I've had er,"
"I had to go to the doctors, carrying on, outside everything"
it's only there pal
I miss
You drop off when you're in
it might rain tomorrow don't it?
I said it looks like rain tomorrow
Not bad
"You got fluoride in this, in this to clean you teeth?"
"I,"
I think it's worse
"I would have thought the three, the first three, the first would of been three, right, but still, you know we want"
ironed out the creases
"Oh yes, right"
"when, when you were next in, being a regular"
"you're, say, a nominal"
What is it exactly then?
What's this one then?
That's eight
"stronger, can do a"
I'm not into strong ale
"Well it's not strong, strong"
"Yeah, yeah"
I find strong ale very heavy
Yeah
er we in fact have a tender
Mm
frequent  the main discussion er was in fact erm internally with our director
right
information or what have you
right
and also to our site teams  cover successfully the job and explain to them how the teams were built up
"right, okay"
the main thing I suppose.
"This was dropped on me out of the blue, I must admit this course"
"Was it , okay?"
Right
erm would be more confidence in presentation
Okay  How to deal with
How to project and verbally
How to give how to give an image of confidence
yes
Okay
"Verbally not written, written"
"Yes sure, yeah"
written
"yes yes absolutely, oh yes this this course is entirely about verbal presentation"
yep
great thanks.
Jeff
erm my name is  and I work for  my objective of this really is to reappraise my presentation skills.
I did this course erm about ten years ago
right
so this is very much a refresher course
okay so you're you're wanting some some feedback
yes
er right  Was that with  with Jeremy?
Yeah.
Measure  the works
re
"In, in, in, in the past"
words.
the resident engineer has been doing the measure and also agreeing the valuations.
Well I don't think
Now
what Hughie's saying is that that will be done
Th that responsibility
mutually
valuations because we've got this
Mm.
Perhaps you do.
"which, which"
Personally I don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement.
"I think, I think it should all be, you know, basically it should be done from"
The offices.
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole.
It's all part of the measuring anyway.
You're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
In accordance with the  and the er the
what do you call it?
Yeah well.
The
Preamble.
preamble.
"Can I take it then, that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator discusses with the team quantity surveyor at the"
Who does what.
Yes.
Who does what because
Yes.
Get it chopped up.
It's a great laugh!
Mm.
But we want one of those halogen jobs.
What are they called?
Hobs.
They are nice!
Mhm.
Not a bad price either.
What the halogen hobs?
Mm.
Oh you're joking!
About five hundred.
Not bad!
"You can't burn stuff on them either, can you?"
"On the halogen ones, no."
It's a
Exactly!
So that's a definite bonus!
"Well it wasn't, although they'd actually be going around burning ourselves anyway!"
"I do, you know those frying pans that you bought, the frying pans and saucepans?"
"An , you know the metal bit that's by the handle  that's a really poor safety device!"
Poor?
On the saucepans there's a metal rim  sort of piece at the end of the handle
Is there?
that that touches the actual saucepan
Yes.
when you pick that up you put your thumb on it!
I
And I burnt myself so many times on that!
Don't pick it up so close to the handle then!
Yeah but it's
"turn that handle, see you later then"
"No I want a pound, lends us a pound Jo"
No
Yeah
No
Yeah
I haven't got a pound on me
Show us  can you lend us a pound?
No
Please
No
Please
"I haven't got any money Neil, I just told you"
Ah?
it's not my fault
It's not mine either
Just give me your change then
I haven't got any change
"Well, how, your coppers, you must have a pound tucked away somewhere mum, mum"
"Have a game of something Neil, then you won't have to go into town will you?"
Not staying here with you  just because you're bored I ain't
I'm not bored
Eh?
Shut up parrot

Oh wowee
I didn't have to help you
"No you didn't, but you did"
er how often has it not
"You won't get any money, go away"
I only want one pound
Why?
What on liquidated damages?
Next.
Shut up .
"S safe, okay."
"Procedure K zero stop one, safety related admin."
"I'm making the point that man management procedures erm, sorry, safety instructions and information and safety information will not be issued via management procedures."
"Management procedures w will relate, will only contain procedures relating to the admin of safety matters."
Yes.
Good.
Excellent
Go back to the clerical section
"You, you'll, you were instrumental about"
I've been fighting this b
that my friend.
I've been fighting this battle for four years and we've eventually got there.
Mm.
Good.
Good.
Next.
It was
Erm maintenance and use of portable electrical apparatus K nineteen stop one.
The safety one.
Er it talks about erm
Safety admin one.
Safety admin one.
"The functions clerical section, section maintaining registers."
Business and planning manager will ensure a contract's in place for routine inspection.
"Business, and business manager will ensure that inspection reports are forwarded to the function heads after inspections."
And there's talking about labelling of defective equipment and what have you.
Good.
And I've been ordered to .
Right.
"he cried , striking his hand upon the wall so that the house rang again ."
"`` Well , and that 's true , too , '' said Alan ; `` and my friend from the Lowlands here '' -LRB- nodding at me -RRB- `` gave me a good word upon that head , if I would only have listened to him . ''"
"`` But see here , '' said James , returning to his former manner , `` if they lay me by the heels , Alan , it 's then that you 'll be needing the money ."
"For with all that I have said and that you have said , it will look very black against the two of us ; do ye mark that ?"
"Well , follow me out , and ye 'll , I 'll see that I 'll have to get a paper out against ye mysel ' ; have to offer a reward for ye ; ay , will I !"
"It 's a sore thing to do between such near friends ; but if I get the dirdum * of this dreadful accident , I 'll have to fend for myself , man ."
Do ye see that ? ''
* Blame .
"He spoke with a pleading earnestness , taking Alan by the breast of the coat ."
"`` Ay '' said Alan , `` I see that . ''"
"`` And ye 'll have to be clear of the country , Alan -- ay , and clear of Scotland -- you and your friend from the Lowlands , too ."
For I 'll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands .
"Ye see that , Alan -- say that ye see that ! ''"
I thought Alan flushed a bit .
"`` This is unco hard on me that brought him here , James , '' said he , throwing his head back ."
`` It 's like making me a traitor ! ''
"`` Now , Alan , man ! ''"
cried James .
`` Look things in the face !
He 'll be papered anyway ; Mungo Campbell 'll be sure to paper him ; what matters if I paper him too ?
"And then , Alan , I am a man that has a family . ''"
"And then , after a little pause on both sides , `` And , Alan , it 'll be a jury of Campbells , '' said he ."
"`` There 's one thing , '' said Alan , musingly , `` that naebody kens his name . ''"
"`` Nor yet they shallnae , Alan !"
"There 's my hand on that , '' cried James , for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage ."
"`` But just the habit he was in , and what he looked like , and his age , and the like ?"
I couldnae well do less . ''
"`` I wonder at your father 's son , '' cried Alan , sternly ."
`` Would ye sell the lad with a gift ?
Would ye change his clothes and then betray him ? ''
"`` No , no , Alan , '' said James ."
"`` No , no : the habit he took off -- the habit Mungo saw him in . ''"
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
"cried Alan , and he stood for a moment , wringing his mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity ."
"`` It 's the bare truth , '' he said , and drew his sword ."
"But before I could touch his blade with mine , he had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground ."
"`` Na , na , '' he kept saying , `` na , na -- I cannae , I cannae . ''"
"At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me ; and I found myself only sick , and sorry , and blank , and wondering at myself ."
"I would have given the world to take back what I had said ; but a word once spoken , who can recapture it ?"
"I minded me of all Alan 's kindness and courage in the past , how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days ; and then recalled my own insults , and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend ."
"At the same time , the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble , and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness ."
I thought I must have swooned where I stood .
This it was that gave me a thought .
"No apology could blot out what I had said ; it was needless to think of one , none could cover the offence ; but where an apology was vain , a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my side ."
I put my pride away from me .
`` Alan ! ''
"I said ; `` if ye cannae help me , I must just die here . ''"
"He started up sitting , and looked at me ."
"`` It 's true , '' said I. `` I 'm by with it ."
"O , let me get into the bield of a house -- I 'll can die there easier . ''"
"I had no need to pretend ; whether I chose or not , I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart of stone ."
`` Can ye walk ? ''
asked Alan .
"`` No , '' said I , `` not without help ."
This last hour my legs have been fainting under me ; I 've a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron ; I cannae breathe right .
"If I die , ye 'll can forgive me , Alan ?"
"In my heart , I liked ye fine -- even when I was the angriest . ''"
"`` Wheesht , wheesht ! ''"
cried Alan .
`` Dinna say that !
"David man , ye ken -- '' He shut his mouth upon a sob ."
"`` Let me get my arm about ye , '' he continued ; `` that 's the way !"
Now lean upon me hard .
Gude kens where there 's a house !
"We 're in Balwhidder , too ; there should be no want of houses , no , nor friends ' houses here ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
"`` The boy who broke the rule last Friday , at afternoon recess , will come to the desk , '' said Mr. Acton in his most impressive manner ."
"If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof it would hardly have caused a greater surprise than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle , with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him ."
"`` Now , Minot , let us have this over as soon as possible , for I do not like it any better than you do , and I am sure there is some mistake ."
I 'm told you went to the shop on Friday .
Is it true ? ''
"asked Mr. Acton very gently , for he liked Jack and seldom had to correct him in any way ."
"`` Yes , sir ; '' and Jack looked up as if proud to show that he was not afraid to tell the truth as far as he could ."
`` To buy something ? ''
"`` No , sir . ''"
`` To meet someone ? ''
"`` Yes , sir . ''"
`` Was it Jerry Shannon ? ''
"No answer , but Jack 's fists doubled up of themselves as he shot another fiery glance at Joe , whose face burned as if it scorched him ."
`` I am told it was ; also that you were seen to go into the saloon with him .
Did you ? ''
"and Mr. Acton looked so sure that it was a mistake that it cost Jack a great effort to say , slowly , -- `` Yes , sir . ''"
"Quite a thrill pervaded the school at this confession , for Jerry was one of the wild fellows the boys all shunned , and to have any dealings with him was considered a very disgraceful thing ."
`` Did you play ? ''
"`` No , sir ."
I ca n't . ''
`` Drink beer ? ''
"`` I belong to the Lodge ; '' and Jack stood as erect as any little soldier who ever marched under a temperance banner , and fought for the cause none are too young nor too old to help along ."
`` I was sure of that .
"Then what took you there , my boy ? ''"
"The question was so kindly put that Jack forgot himself an instant , and blurted out , -- `` I only went to pay him some money , sir . ''"
"`` Ah , how much ? ''"
"`` Two seventy-five , '' muttered Jack , as red as a cherry at not being able to keep a secret better ."
`` Too much for a lad like you to owe such a fellow as Jerry .
How came it ? ''
And Mr. Acton looked disturbed .
"Jack opened his lips to speak , but shut them again , and stood looking down with a little quiver about the mouth that showed how much it cost him to be silent ."
`` Does any one beside Jerry know of this ? ''
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies . '
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration , and he thought it was because he had run away , but it was really because he knew fairies ."
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful .
"She poured out questions about them , to his surprise , for they were rather a nuisance to him , getting in his way and so on , and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding ."
"Still , he liked them on the whole , and he told her about the beginning of fairies ."
"` You see , Wendy , when the first baby laughed for the first time , its laugh broke into a thousand pieces , and they all went skipping about , and that was the beginning of fairies . '"
"Tedious talk this , but being a stay-at-home she liked it ."
"` And so , ' he went on good-naturedly , ` there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl . '"
` Ought to be ?
Is n't there ? '
` No .
"You see children know such a lot now , they soon do n't believe in fairies , and every time a child says , ' I do n't believe in fairies , ' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead ."
"Really , he thought they had now talked enough about fairies , and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet . '"
"I ca n't think where she has gone to , ' he said , rising , and he called Tink by name ."
Wendy 's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill .
"` Peter , ' she cried , clutching him , ` you do n't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room ! '"
"` She was here just now , ' he said a little impatiently ."
"` You do n't hear her , do you ? '"
and they both listened .
"` The only sound I hear , ' said Wendy , ` is like a tinkle of bells . '"
"` Well , that 's Tink , that 's the fairy language ."
I think I hear her too . '
"The sound came from the chest of drawers , and Peter made a merry face ."
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter , and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh ."
He had his first laugh still .
"` Wendy , ' he whispered gleefully , ' I do believe I shut her up in the drawer ! '"
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer , and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury ."
"` You should n't say such things , ' Peter retorted ."
"` Of course I 'm very sorry , but how could I know you were in the drawer ? '"
Wendy was not listening to him . '
"O Peter , ' she cried , ` if she would only stand still and let me see her ! '"
"` They hardly ever stand still , ' he said , but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock . '"
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook .
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles .
"Lincoln opened it , or rather he had his hand on the hasp of twisted withes which secured it , when he was suddenly arrested by the apparition of a girl , who flashed around the curve of young birch beyond and stood before him with panting breath and quivering lips ."
"`` I beg your pardon , '' said John Lincoln courteously , dropping the gate and lifting his hat ."
`` I am looking for the house of Mr. James Conway -- ` The Evergreens . '
Can you direct me to it ? ''
"`` That is Mr. James Conway 's house , '' said the girl , with the tragic air and tone of one driven to desperation and an impatient gesture of her hand toward the yellow nightmare above them ."
"`` I do n't think he can be the one I mean , '' said Lincoln perplexedly ."
"`` The man I am thinking of has a niece , Miss Richmond . ''"
"`` There is no other James Conway in Plainfield , '' said the girl ."
`` This is his place -- nobody calls it ` The Evergreens ' but myself .
I am Sidney Richmond . ''
"For a moment they looked at each other across the gate , sheer amazement and bewilderment holding John Lincoln mute ."
"Sidney , burning with shame , saw that this stranger was exceedingly good to look upon -- tall , clean-limbed , broad-shouldered , with clear-cut bronzed features and a chin and eyes that would have done honour to any man ."
"John Lincoln , among all his confused sensations , was aware that this slim , agitated young creature before him was the loveliest thing he ever had seen , so lithe was her figure , so glossy and dark and silken her bare , wind-ruffled hair , so big and brown and appealing her eyes , so delicately oval her flushed cheeks ."
"He felt that she was frightened and in trouble , and he wanted to comfort and reassure her ."
But how could she be Sidney Richmond ?
"`` I do n't understand , '' he said perplexedly ."
`` Oh ! ''
Sidney threw out her hands in a burst of passionate protest .
"`` No , and you never will understand -- I ca n't make you understand . ''"
"`` I do n't understand , '' said John Lincoln again ."
`` Can you be Sidney Richmond -- the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years ? ''
`` I am . ''
"`` Then , those letters -- '' `` Were all lies , '' said Sidney bluntly and desperately ."
`` There was nothing true in them -- nothing at all .
This is my home .
We are poor .
Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination . ''
`` Then why did you write them ? ''
he asked blankly .
`` Why did you deceive me ? ''
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
Could anything be more exciting or more useful ?
"So he put it in his pocket , and ran quickly away out of the mountain by a little door which had been left open ."
When he got home his parents asked him what he had been doing and where he had got the fine clothes he wore .
"` Oh , I earned them myself , ' answered he ."
"` You never earned them in this short time , ' said his father ."
` Be off with you ; I wo n't keep you here .
I will have no thieves in my house ! '
"` Well I only came to help you , ' replied the boy sulkily ."
"` Now I 'll be off , as you wish ; but to-morrow morning when you rise you will see a great dog at the door ."
"Do not drive it away , but take it to the castle and sell it to the duke , and they will give you ten dollars for it ; only you must bring the strap you lead it with , back to the house . '"
Sure enough the next day the dog was standing at the door waiting to be let in .
"The old man was rather afraid of getting into trouble , but his wife urged him to sell the dog as the boy had bidden him , so he took it up to the castle and sold it to the duke for ten dollars ."
"But he did not forget to take off the strap with which he had led the animal , and to carry it home ."
When he got there old Kirsten met him at the door .
"` Well , Peder , and have you sold the dog ? '"
asked she .
"` Yes , Kirsten ; and I have brought back ten dollars , as the boy told us , ' answered Peder ."
` Ay !
but that 's fine ! '
said his wife .
"` Now you see what one gets by doing as one is bid ; if it had not been for me you would have driven the dog away again , and we should have lost the money ."
"After all , I always know what is best . '"
` Nonsense ! '
said her husband ; ` women always think they know best .
I should have sold the dog just the same whatever you had told me .
"Put the money away in a safe place , and do n't talk so much . '"
"The next day Hans came again ; but though everything had turned out as he had foretold , he found that his father was still not quite satisfied ."
` Be off with you ! '
"said he , ` you 'll get us into trouble . ' '"
"I have n't helped you enough yet , ' replied the boy ."
"` To-morrow there will come a great fat cow , as big as the house ."
Take it to the king 's palace and you 'll get as much as a thousand dollars for it .
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
"If you 'd sassed her back , I 'd have thought she deserved it and would n't have blamed you a mite , but I would n't have bothered coming to talk to you either ."
"Well , well well !"
"Poor child , do n't cry ."
You just pick up and go home .
I 'll make it all right with Tom .
"You 're pretty near played out yourself , I can see that ."
"But a summer in Fir Cottage , with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery , will soon make another girl of you ."
Do n't you dare to thank me .
It 's a privilege to be able to do something for Mary Carvell 's girls .
I just loved Mary . ''
"The upshot of the whole matter was that Marcella and Patty went , two days later , to Dalesboro , where Miss Draper gave them a hearty welcome to Fir Cottage -- a quaint , delightful little house circled by big Scotch firs and overgrown with vines ."
Never were such delightful weeks as those that followed .
Patty came rapidly back to health and strength .
"As for Marcella , Miss Draper 's prophecy was also fulfilled ; she soon looked and felt like another girl ."
"The dismal years of drudgery behind her were forgotten like a dream , and she lived wholly in the beautiful present , in the walks and drives , the flowers and grass slopes , and in the pleasant household duties which she shared with Miss Draper ."
"`` I love housework , '' she exclaimed one September day ."
`` I do n't like the thought of going back to the store a bit . ''
"`` Well , you 're not going back , '' calmly said Miss Draper , who had a habit of arranging other people 's business for them that might have been disconcerting had it not been for her keen insight and hearty good sense ."
`` You 're going to stay here with me -- you and Patty .
"I do n't propose to die of lonesomeness losing you , and I need somebody to help me about the house ."
I 've thought it all out .
"You are to call me Aunt Josephine , and Patty is to go to school ."
"I had this scheme in mind from the first , but I thought I 'd wait to see how we got along living in the same house , and how you liked it here , before I spoke out ."
"No , you need n't thank me this time either ."
I 'm doing this every bit as much for my sake as yours .
"Well , that 's all settled ."
"Patty wo n't object , bless her rosy cheeks ! ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"said Marcella , with eyes shining through her tears ."
"`` I 'm so happy , dear Miss Draper -- I mean Aunt Josephine ."
I 'll love to stay here -- and I will thank you . ''
`` Fudge ! ''
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
`` He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day .
"She did not look very happy , but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances . ''"
"`` Anyhow , '' thought Rilla , `` I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys ."
How Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid 's part in it ! ''
But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station .
"The dawn was white as a pearl , clear as a diamond ."
Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted .
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at Ingleside .
Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his .
Rilla choked suddenly .
It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flat-featured .
It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
"All that mattered was that rapt , sacrificial look in her eyes -- that ever-burning , sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front ."
"Rilla walked away , realising that she must not spy on such a moment ."
"She went down to the end of the platform where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting , looking at each other ."
Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly : `` Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land ?
Is it a pose ?
Or a fixed idea ? ''
"Whereat Dog Monday , laconically : `` I have a tryst to keep . ''"
When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda .
"`` Well , he 's gone , '' said Miranda , `` and he may never come back -- but I 'm his wife , and I 'm going to be worthy of him ."
I 'm going home . ''
`` Do n't you think you had better come with me now ? ''
asked Rilla doubtfully .
Nobody knew yet how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter .
`` No .
"If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father , '' said Miranda daringly ."
`` A soldier 's wife ca n't be a coward .
"Come on , Wilfy ."
I 'll go straight home and meet the worst . ''
"There was nothing very dreadful to face , however ."
"Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda -- also , that there was such a thing as a separation allowance ."
And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in !
"`` When poor Fred became convinced that I could n't promise him , he behaved beautifully -- though that rather made things worse ."
"If he had been nasty about it I would n't have felt so heartbroken and remorseful -- though why I should feel remorseful I do n't know , for I never encouraged Fred to think I cared a bit about him ."
Yet feel remorseful I did -- and do .
"If Fred Arnold never comes back from overseas , this will haunt me all my life ."
"`` Then Fred said if he could n't take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship , and would I kiss him just once in good-bye before he went -- perhaps for ever ?"
"`` I do n't know how I could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful , interesting things ."
They are horrible .
"I could n't even give poor heartbroken Fred one little kiss , because of my promise to Ken ."
It seemed so brutal .
"I had to tell Fred that of course he would have my friendship , but that I could n't kiss him because I had promised somebody else I would n't ."
"`` He said , ` It is -- is it -- Ken Ford ? '"
`` I nodded .
It seemed dreadful to have to tell it -- it was such a sacred little secret just between me and Ken .
`` When Fred went away I came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter .
I told her .
"She listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said , ` Can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby ? '"
"But she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic , oh , just so race-of-Josephy -- that I felt indescribably comforted ."
Mothers are the dearest things . ''
"` But oh , mother , ' I sobbed , ` he wanted me to kiss him good-bye -- and I could n't -- and that hurt me worse than all the rest . ' ''"
"` Well , why did n't you kiss him ? '"
asked mother coolly .
"` Considering the circumstances , I think you might have . ' ''"
"` But I could n't , mother -- I promised Ken when he went away that I would n't kiss anybody else until he came back . '"
`` This was another high explosive for poor mother .
"She exclaimed , with the queerest little catch in her voice , ` Rilla , are you engaged to Kenneth Ford ? ' ''"
"` I -- do n't -- know , ' I sobbed . ''"
` You -- do n't -- know ? '
repeated mother .
"`` Then I had to tell her the whole story , too ; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant anything serious ."
I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through .
`` Mother sat a little while in silence .
"Emily , who had said nothing , now spoke harshly ."
"`` Lynde is right , Mr. Douglas ."
You have no right to risk your life for a stranger .
"My advice is to go to the village for help , and Lynde and I will make a fire and watch here ."
That is all that can be expected of you or us . ''
Alan paid no heed to Emily .
Very tenderly he loosened Lynde 's hold on his arm and looked into her quivering face .
"`` You know it is my duty , Lynde , '' he said gently ."
"`` If anything can be done for that poor man , I am the only one who can do it ."
"I will come back safe , please God ."
"Be brave , dear . ''"
"Lynde , with a little moan of resignation , turned away ."
Old Emily looked on with a face of grim disapproval as Alan waded out into the surf that boiled and swirled around him in a mad whirl of foam .
"The shower of sleet had again slackened , and the wreck half a mile away , with its solitary figure , was dearly visible ."
"Alan beckoned to the man to jump overboard and swim ashore , enforcing his appeal by gestures that commanded haste before the next shower should come ."
For a few moments it seemed as if the seaman did not understand or lacked the courage or power to obey .
The next minute he had dropped from the rigging on the crest of a mighty wave and was being borne onward to the shore .
"Speedily the backwater was reached and the man , sucked down by the swirl of the wave , threw up his arms and disappeared ."
"Alan dashed in , groping , swimming ; it seemed an eternity before his hand clutched the drowning man and wrenched him from the undertow ."
"And , with the seaman in his arms , he staggered back through the foam and dropped his burden on the sand at Lynde 's feet ."
"Alan was reeling from exhaustion and chilled to the marrow , but he thought only of the man he had rescued ."
"The latter was unconscious and , as Alan bent over him , he heard Lynde give a choking little cry ."
"`` He is living still , '' said Alan ."
`` We must get him up to the house as soon as possible .
How shall we manage it ? ''
"`` Lynde and I can go and bring the Captain 's mattress down , '' said Emily ."
Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could .
`` Then you and I can carry him up to the house . ''
"`` That will be best , '' said Alan ."
`` Go quickly . ''
He did not look at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face .
She cast one glance at the prostrate man and followed Emily .
"Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !"
"He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! ''"
"`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . ''"
"` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver ."
"`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
"I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''"
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
"I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel ."
"Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard ."
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
"They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets ."
"Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts ."
But that 's not the course I lay .
"I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion ."
"I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest ."
"Time enough too , says you ."
"Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea ."
And how did I begin ?
"Before the mast , like you ! ''"
"`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ?"
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
"`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? ''"
asked Silver derisively .
"`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion ."
"`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor ."
But my old missis has it all by now .
"And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me ."
"I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . ''"
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
asked the other .
"`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it ."
"But I have a way with me , I have ."
"Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house ."
This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . ''
"They took up the old archer , and carried him between them into his house , where he had dwelt alone ."
"And there they laid him on the floor , out of regard for the mattress , and sought , as best they might , to straighten and compose his limbs ."
Appleyard 's house was clean and bare .
"There was a bed , with a blue cover , a cupboard , a great chest , a pair of joint-stools , a hinged table in the chimney corner , and hung upon the wall the old soldier 's armoury of bows and defensive armour ."
Hatch began to look about him curiously .
"`` Nick had money , '' he said ."
`` He may have had three score pounds put by .
I would I could light upo n't !
"When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him ."
"See , now , this chest ."
I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein .
"He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer ."
Now may God rest his spirit !
"Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he 's on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . ''"
"`` Come , Hatch , '' said Dick , `` respect his stone-blind eyes ."
Would ye rob the man before his body ?
"Nay , he would walk ! ''"
"Hatch made several signs of the cross ; but by this time his natural complexion had returned , and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose ."
"It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded , and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall , portly , ruddy , black-eyed man of near fifty , in a surplice and black robe ."
"`` Appleyard '' -- the newcomer was saying , as he entered ; but he stopped dead ."
`` Ave Maria ! ''
he cried .
`` Saints be our shield !
What cheer is this ? ''
"`` Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , '' answered Hatch , with perfect cheerfulness ."
"`` Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates ."
Ay !
"there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . ''"
"Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool , and sat down upon it , sick and white ."
`` This is a judgment !
"`` Oh , I did n't mean to deceive you !"
I never thought of such a thing .
"When you asked me to write to you I wanted to , but I did n't know what to write about to a stranger ."
"I just could n't write you about my life here , not because it was hard , but it was so ugly and empty ."
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live -- the life I did live in imagination .
"And when once I had begun , I had to keep it up ."
"I found it so fascinating , too !"
Those letters made that other life seem real to me .
I never expected to meet you .
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me .
"Oh , please go away and forgive me if you can !"
I know I can never make you understand how it came about . ''
Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her .
It was worse than she had even thought it would be .
"He was so handsome , so manly , so earnest-eyed !"
"Oh , what a friend to lose !"
John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her .
"There was a great tenderness in his face , mingled with a little kindly , friendly amusement ."
"`` Please do n't distress yourself so , Sidney , '' he said , unconsciously using her Christian name ."
`` I think I do understand .
I 'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for .
"After all , those letters were true -- or , rather , there was truth in them ."
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life . ''
"Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him , a little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe ."
This young man was certainly good at understanding .
`` You -- you 'll forgive me then ? ''
she stammered .
"`` Yes , if there is anything to forgive ."
"And for my own part , I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were ."
"If I had come here and found you what I expected , living in such a home as I expected , I never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters have been the things most eagerly looked forward to ."
"I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you , and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning , and that would have been all ."
"`` But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl , much like my sisters at home , except that she is a great deal cleverer ."
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
was the answer .
"`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! ''"
"After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer ."
"`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically ."
"And not long after , without another word , he passed away ."
"In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco ."
"He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle ."
"Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours ."
This seemed mightily to relieve him .
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
"But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body ."
"`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand ."
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
"It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . ''"
Then he pulled me aside .
"`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? ''"
"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later ."
"`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said ."
"`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . ''"
`` How do you mean ? ''
I asked .
"`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load ."
"That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain ."
"`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do ."
"But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . ''"
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
"Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood ."
`` Oho ! ''
said the captain .
`` Blaze away !
"You 've little enough powder already , my lads . ''"
"At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage ."
We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall .
"For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House ."
There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I came by you and Matcham .
"I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together ."
"Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself ."
"But see , '' he added , `` this poor shrew begins a little to revive ."
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
"The knight , from under his long dress , produced a stout bottle , and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient , who returned gradually to consciousness , and began to roll dim eyes from one to another ."
"`` What cheer , Jack ! ''"
said Dick .
"`` It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel !"
See ! ''
"`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' said the knight ."
`` This will give you manhood .
"Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall ."
"For , Dick , '' he continued , laying forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls ."
"Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down ."
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lads will pick me their way home .
"Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six ."
"Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''"
"And so saying , the knight filled himself a horn of canary , and pledged his ward in dumb show ."
"`` Selden , '' Dick faltered -- `` Selden '' -- And he paused again ."
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
"he cried , in a changed voice ."
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
"The knight heard in silence ; but as he listened , his countenance became convulsed with rage and grief ."
"`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook ."
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
Not you !
"As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand ."
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
"I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another ."
"Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream ."
"The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon ."
"Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye ."
"He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring ."
`` John ! ''
"said the sailor , stretching out his hand ."
`` Hands off ! ''
"cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast ."
"`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other ."
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
"But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? ''"
`` That ? ''
"returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass ."
`` That ?
"Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . ''"
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero .
`` Alan ! ''
he cried .
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman !
"And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more ."
"If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty ."
"You 've killed Alan , have you ?"
"Kill me too , if you can ."
But I defies you . ''
"And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach ."
But he was not destined to go far .
He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King .
"`` I saw her only for a moment , '' he said coldly , `` but she impressed me as being a beautiful woman . ''"
"`` They tell queer stories about her -- but maybe they 're not all true , '' said Isabel , unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice ."
At that moment Alan 's secret contempt for her crystallized into pronounced aversion .
He made no reply and they went the rest of the way in silence .
"At her gate Isabel said , `` You have n't been over to see us very lately , Mr. Douglas . ''"
"`` My congregation is a large one and I can not visit all my people as often as I might wish , '' Alan answered , all the more coldly for the personal note in her tone ."
"`` A minister 's time is not his own , you know . ''"
`` Shall you be going to see the Olivers ? ''
asked Isabel bluntly .
`` I have not considered that question .
"Good-night , Miss King . ''"
On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question .
Should he make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of Four Winds ?
"It surprised him to find how much he wanted to , but he finally concluded that he would not ."
They were not adherents of his church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone .
"When he got home , although it was late , he went to his study and began work on a new text -- for Elder Trewin 's seemed utterly out of the question ."
Even with the new one he did not get on very well .
At last in exasperation he leaned back in his chair .
Why ca n't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people ?
"Here , let me put these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them ."
That girl had a beautiful face but a cold one .
Would I like to see it lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free ?
"Yes , frankly , I would ."
She looked upon me with indifference .
Would I like to see her welcome me as a friend ?
"I have a conviction that I would , although no doubt everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable friend for me ."
"Do I believe that she is wild , unwomanly , heathenish , as Mrs. Danby says ?"
"No , I do not , most emphatically ."
"I believe she is a lady in the truest sense of that much abused word , though she is doubtless unconventional ."
"Having said all this , I do not see what more there is to be said ."
And -- I -- am -- going -- to -- write -- this -- sermon .
I must not even come here any more .
You understand that ? ''
`` Yes . ''
There was an unconscious revelation in the girl 's mournful eyes as she turned them on Alan .
It thrilled him to the core of his being .
She loved him .
"If it were not for that empty marriage form , he could win her , but the knowledge was only an added mocking torment ."
Alan had not known a man could endure such misery and live .
A score of wild questions rushed to his lips but he crushed them back for Lynde 's sake and held out his hand .
"`` Good-bye , dear , '' he said almost steadily , daring to say no more lest he should say too much ."
"`` Good-bye , '' Lynde answered faintly ."
When he had gone she flung herself down on the moss by the spring and lay there in an utter abandonment of misery and desolation .
Pain and indignation struggled for mastery in Alan 's stormy soul as he walked homeward .
So this was Captain Anthony 's doings !
He had sacrificed his daughter to some crime of his dubious past .
Alan never dreamed of blaming Lynde for having kept her marriage a secret ; he put the blame where it belonged -- on the Captain 's shoulders .
Captain Anthony had never warned him by so much as a hint that Lynde was not free to be won .
It had all probably seemed a good joke to him .
Alan thought the furtive amusement he had so often detected in the Captain 's eyes was explained now .
He found Elder Trewin in his study when he got home .
The good Elder 's face was stern and anxious ; he had called on a distasteful errand -- to tell the young minister of the scandal his intimacy with the Four Winds people was making in the congregation and remonstrate with him concerning it .
"Alan listened absently , with none of the resentment he would have felt at the interference a day previously ."
A man does not mind a pin-prick when a limb is being wrenched away .
"`` I can promise you that my objectionable calls at Four Winds will cease , '' he said sarcastically , when the Elder had finished ."
"Elder Trewin got himself away , feeling snubbed but relieved ."
"`` Took it purty quiet , '' he reflected ."
`` Do n't believe there was much in the yarns after all .
Isabel King started them and probably she exaggerated a lot .
I suppose he 's had some notion like as not of bringing the Captain over to the church .
"But that 's foolish , for he 'd never manage it , and meanwhile was giving occasion for gossip ."
It 's just as well to stop it .
"He 's a good pastor and he works hard -- too hard , mebbe ."
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
"My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later ."
"My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor ."
We had no relatives .
"I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father ."
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
"I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum ."
"I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit ."
"I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her ."
But I have found her at last .
"You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''"
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
"You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her ."
"And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day ."
There is no doubt in the world .
"Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''"
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha 's eyes were shining like stars .
"She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother 's shoulder ."
"By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings ."
"`` I have n't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max ."
"`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake ."
"Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''"
"Well they had an amazing time then , of course ."
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
"Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places ."
"It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley did n't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust ."
"However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery ."
"In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day ."
They then quarrelled ; the cause of the quarrel was insignificant ; with anyone else than Eugene a reconciliation would soon have been effected .
But Eugene never was friendly with your father from that time .
I think he was jealous of old Grandfather 's affection ; thought the old man loved your father best .
"And then , as I have said , he was very eccentric and stubborn ."
"Well , your father went away to college and graduated , and then -- we were married ."
Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying me .
He wanted him to marry somebody else .
He told him he would disinherit him if he married me .
I did not know this until we were married .
But Grandfather Page kept his word .
"He sent for a lawyer and had a new will made , leaving everything to Eugene ."
"I think , nay , I am sure , that he would have relented in time , but he died the very next week ; they found him dead in his bed one morning , so Eugene got everything ; and that is all there is of the story , Dorinda . ''"
`` And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since ? ''
"`` Yes , ever since ."
"So you see , Dorinda dear , that I can not ask any favours of Uncle Eugene . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , '' said Dorinda understandingly ."
"We kept thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home , dining off potatoes on Thanksgiving !"
But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied .
When Kate and I were washing the dishes she came out quite beamingly .
"`` Well , my dears , I must admit that you made a very good job of the dinner , indeed ."
The turkey was done to perfection .
"As for the mince pies -- well , of course Miranda Mary made them , but she must have had extra good luck with them , for they were excellent and heated to just the right degree ."
"You did n't give anything to the McGinnis dog , I hope ? ''"
"`` No , we did n't give him anything , '' said Kate ."
Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis .
When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out of the house and went home .
Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we had n't robbed them of their dinner .
But we had to tell them the whole story before we even took off our hats .
"`` There is a special Providence for children and idiots , '' said Laura gently ."
We did n't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or both .
There are some things better left in obscurity .
I 'd have probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously .
`` What my mother hopes .
"John , what are -- '' But Hook had found his voice again ."
`` Tie her up ! ''
he shouted .
It was Smee who tied her to the mast .
"`` See here , honey , '' he whispered , `` I 'll save you if you promise to be my mother . ''"
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise .
"`` I would almost rather have no children at all , '' she said disdainfully -LSB- scornfully -RSB- ."
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast ; the eyes of all were on the plank : that last little walk they were about to take .
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully , for the capacity to think had gone from them ; they could stare and shiver only ."
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed , and took a step toward Wendy ."
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one .
"But he never reached her , he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her ."
He heard something else instead .
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile .
"They all heard it -- pirates , boys , Wendy ; and immediately every head was blown in one direction ; not to the water whence the sound proceeded , but toward Hook ."
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone , and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators ."
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him .
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint .
He fell in a little heap .
"The sound came steadily nearer ; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought , `` The crocodile is about to board the ship ! ''"
Even the iron claw hung inactive ; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted .
"Left so fearfully alone , any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell : but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working , and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go ."
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him , and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke ."
`` Hide me ! ''
he cried hoarsely .
"They gathered round him , all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard ."
They had no thought of fighting it .
It was Fate .
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship 's side to see the crocodile climbing it .
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights ; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid .
It was Peter .
"If you can not attend to your business , I shall go to the floor walker and ask him to direct me to somebody who can ."
The laziness and disobligingness of the girls in this store is really getting beyond endurance . ''
A passionate answer was on the point of Marcella 's tongue .
All her bitterness and suffering and resentment flashed into her face and eyes .
"For one moment she was determined to speak out , to repay Mrs. Liddell 's insolence in kind ."
A retort was ready to her hand .
"Everyone knew that Mrs. Liddell , before her marriage to a wealthy man , had been a working girl ."
"What could be easier than to say contemptuously : `` You should be a judge of a clerk 's courtesy and ability , madam ."
You were a shop girl yourself once ? ''
"But if she said it , what would follow ?"
Prompt and instant dismissal .
And Patty ?
The thought of the little sister quelled the storm in Marcella 's soul .
For Patty 's sake she must control her temper -- and she did .
"With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly : `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Liddell ."
I did not mean to be inattentive .
"Let me show you some of our new lingerie waists , I think you will like them . ''"
But Mrs. Liddell did not like the new lingerie waists which Marcella brought to her in her trembling hands .
For another half hour she examined and found fault and sneered .
"Then she swept away with the scornful remark that she did n't see a thing there that was fit to wear , and she would go to Markwell Bros. and see if they had anything worth looking at ."
"When she had gone , Marcella leaned against the counter , pale and exhausted ."
She must have a breathing spell .
"Oh , how her head ached !"
How hot and stifling and horrible everything was !
She longed for the country herself .
"Oh , if she and Patty could only go away to some place where there were green clover meadows and cool breezes and great hills where the air was sweet and pure !"
During all this time a middle-aged woman had been sitting on a stool beside the bargain counter .
"When a clerk asked her if she wished to be waited on , she said , `` No , I 'm just waiting here for a friend who promised to meet me . ''"
She was tall and gaunt and grey haired .
"She had square jaws and cold grey eyes and an aggressive nose , but there was something attractive in her plain face , a mingling of common sense and kindliness ."
She watched Marcella and Mrs. Liddell closely and lost nothing of all that was said and done on both sides .
Now and then she smiled grimly and nodded .
"`` I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter , '' exclaimed Murray rapturously , not meaning a syllable of it , but devoutly believing he did ."
Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray heard music that was not of the birds .
"It was a girl 's voice singing beyond the maples to his left -- a clear sweet voice , blithely trilling out the old-fashioned song , `` Five O'Clock in the Morning . ''"
`` Mrs. Palmer 's niece ! ''
Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples .
He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt reasonably well acquainted with her .
"Moreover , Mrs. Palmer had assured him that Mollie was a very pretty girl ."
Now a pretty girl milking cows at sunrise in the meadows sounded well .
Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece 's beauty .
Murray said so to himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey less than ten yards away from him .
Murray 's artistic instinct responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction .
"He could see only her profile , but that was perfect , and the colouring of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something to adore ."
"Her hair , ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the morning wind , was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her bare head , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were as white as marble ."
"Presently she began to sing again , and this time Murray joined in ."
She half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the maples .
"Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly , but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about her lips ."
"That , and the revelation of her full face , decided him ."
He sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of lush clover blossoms .
"`` Good morning , '' he said coolly ."
"He had forgotten her other name , and it did not matter ; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities ."
`` Is n't it rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone ?
May I help you ? ''
Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder .
She had glorious grey eyes .
Her face was serene and undisturbed .
`` Can you milk ? ''
she asked .
"`` Unlikely as it may seem , I can , '' said Murray ."
"`` I have never confessed it to Mrs. Emory , because I was afraid she would inveigle me into milking her fourteen cows ."
But I do n't mind helping you .
I learned to milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm .
May I have that extra pail ? ''
"I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position ."
I should very much like to move about .
"If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '"
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
"I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !"
They have all run away ! ' '
"I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man ."
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
"` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '"
"` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog ."
"` Why , you have only just been made ."
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
"He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter ."
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
"I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant ."
"That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend ."
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
"barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep ."
The weather really did change .
"Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing ."
"But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight ."
"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms ."
"The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white ."
"The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet ."
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
"They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees ."
Never to feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about his work in the valley fields !
Never to stoop with a glad thrill over the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to her !
Jeffrey groaned aloud .
"No , he could not go up to see her that night ; he must wait -- he must strengthen himself ."
Then his heart rebuked him .
This was selfishness ; this was putting his own feelings before hers -- a thing he had sworn never to do .
Perhaps she needed him -- perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer her such poor service as might be in his power .
"He turned and went down through the orchard lane , taking the old field-path across the valley and up the hill , which he had traversed so often and so joyfully in boyhood ."
"It was dark now , and a few stars were shining in the silvery sky ."
The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under them .
Sometimes he felt that he must turn back -- that his pain was going to master him ; then he forced himself to go on .
"The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the dull light , with its leafless vines clinging to it ."
There were no lights in it .
It looked like a home left soulless .
Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked .
"He had expected the maid to open it , put Sara herself came ."
"`` Why , Jeff , '' she said , with pleasure in her tones ."
`` I am so glad to see you .
I have been wondering why you had not come before . ''
"`` I did not think you would want to see me yet , '' he said hurriedly ."
`` I have thought about you every hour -- but I feared to intrude . '' ''
"You could n't intrude , '' she said gently ."
"`` Yes , I have wanted to see you , Jeff ."
Come into the library . ''
He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare calls .
Sara lighted the lamp on the table .
"As the light shot up she stood clearly revealed in it -- a tall , slender woman in a trailing gown of grey ."
"Even a stranger , not knowing her age , would have guessed it to be what it was , yet it would have been hard to say what gave the impression of maturity ."
"Her face was quite unlined -- a little pale , perhaps , with more finely cut outlines than those of youth ."
"Her eyes were clear and bright ; her abundant brown hair waved back from her face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned child of six , under the pines ."
Perhaps it was the fine patience and serenity in her face that told her tale of years .
Youth can never acquire it .
he said .
`` Dinner ? ''
"`` Ay , sot , '' replied the cook , `` dinner it is , and a dry dinner , too , with neither ale nor bread ."
"But there is little pleasure in the greenwood now ; time was when a good fellow could live here like a mitred abbot , set aside the rain and the white frosts ; he had his heart 's desire both of ale and wine ."
"But now are men 's spirits dead ; and this John Amend-All , save us and guard us !"
but a stuffed booby to scare crows withal . ''
"`` Nay , '' returned the other , `` y ' are too set on meat and drinking , Lawless ."
Bide ye a bit ; the good time cometh . ''
"`` Look ye , '' returned the cook , `` I have even waited for this good time sith that I was so high ."
"I have been a grey friar ; I have been a king 's archer ; I have been a shipman , and sailed the salt seas ; and I have been in greenwood before this , forsooth !"
and shot the king 's deer .
What cometh of it ?
Naught !
I were better to have bided in the cloister .
John Abbot availeth more than John Amend-All .
By ' r Lady !
here they come . ''
"One after another , tall , likely fellows began to stroll into the lawn ."
"Each as he came produced a knife and a horn cup , helped himself from the caldron , and sat down upon the grass to eat ."
"They were very variously equipped and armed ; some in rusty smocks , and with nothing but a knife and an old bow ; others in the height of forest gallantry , all in Lincoln green , both hood and jerkin , with dainty peacock arrows in their belts , a horn upon a baldrick , and a sword and dagger at their sides ."
"They came in the silence of hunger , and scarce growled a salutation , but fell instantly to meat ."
"There were , perhaps , a score of them already gathered , when a sound of suppressed cheering arose close by among the hawthorns , and immediately after five or six woodmen carrying a stretcher debauched upon the lawn ."
"A tall , lusty fellow , somewhat grizzled , and as brown as a smoked ham , walked before them with an air of some authority , his bow at his back , a bright boar-spear in his hand ."
`` Lads ! ''
"he cried , `` good fellows all , and my right merry friends , y ' have sung this while on a dry whistle and lived at little ease ."
But what said I ever ?
"Abide Fortune constantly ; she turneth , turneth swift ."
And lo !
"here is her little firstling -- even that good creature , ale ! ''"
There was a murmur of applause as the bearers set down the stretcher and displayed a goodly cask .
"`` And now haste ye , boys , '' the man continued ."
`` There is work toward .
At first my only feeling was one of annoyance .
Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear .
The tide would be high that night .
If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned .
I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the face .
I could not swim ; calls for help could not reach anybody ; my only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of some boat appearing .
I looked at my watch .
It was a quarter past three .
"The tide would begin to turn about five , but it would be at least ten before the rock would be covered ."
"I had , then , little more than six hours to live unless rescued ."
The flat was by this time out of sight around the point .
I hoped that the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone 's attention and lead to investigation .
That seemed to be my only hope .
No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard 's because of my non-appearance .
They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam 's .
"I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament , but to me it seemed fairly to fly , for every moment decreased my chance of rescue ."
"I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear , so , with a murmured prayer for help , I set myself to the task of waiting for death as bravely as possible ."
"At intervals I shouted as loudly as I could and , when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall , '' I took the picture ."
"It afterwards turned out to be a great success , but I have never been able to look at it without a shudder ."
At five the tide began to come in .
"Very , very slowly the water rose around Island Rock ."
"Up , up , up it came , while I watched it with fascinated eyes , feeling like a rat in a trap ."
"The sun fell lower and lower ; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright ; at nine it was a lovely night , dear , calm , bright as day , and the water was swishing over the highest ledge of the rock ."
With some difficulty I climbed to the top and sat there to await the end .
"I had no longer any hope of rescue but , by a great effort , I preserved self-control ."
"If I had to die , I would at least face death staunchly ."
"But when I thought of my mother at home , it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down utterly ."
Suddenly I heard a whistle .
Never was sound so sweet .
I stood up and peered eagerly shoreward .
"Coming around the `` Hole in the Wall '' headland , on top of the cliffs , I saw a boy and a dog ."
I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward .
"Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle ; the rest rode in pursuit ; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground , and it was plain their quarry would escape them ."
"Hatch , roaring an oath , put his horse at the hedge , to head him off ; but the beast refused , and sent his rider sprawling in the dust ."
"And though he was up again in a moment , and had caught the bridle , the time had gone by , and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture ."
The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton .
"Instead of starting in a vain pursuit , he had whipped his crossbow from his back , bent it , and set a quarrel to the string ; and now , when the others had desisted , he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot ."
`` Shoot !
shoot ! ''
"cried the priest , with sanguinary violence ."
"`` Cover him , Master Dick , '' said Bennet ."
`` Bring me him down like a ripe apple . ''
The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety ; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill ; and the man ran slower in proportion .
"What with the greyness of the falling night , and the uneven movements of the runner , it was no easy aim ; and as Dick levelled his bow , he felt a kind of pity , and a half desire that he might miss ."
The quarrel sped .
"The man stumbled and fell , and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers ."
But they were counting their corn before the harvest .
"The man fell lightly ; he was lightly afoot again , turned and waved his cap in a bravado , and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood ."
`` And the plague go with him ! ''
cried Bennet .
"`` He has thieves ' heels ; he can run , by St Banbury !"
"But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! ''"
"`` Nay , but what made he by the church ? ''"
asked Sir Oliver .
`` I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here .
"Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . ''"
Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper .
"`` This writing was pinned to the church door , '' he said , handing it to the parson ."
"`` I found naught else , sir parson . ''"
"`` Now , by the power of Mother Church , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` but this runs hard on sacrilege !"
"For the king 's good pleasure , or the lord of the manor -- well !"
"But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door -- nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight ."
But what have we here ?
The light falls apace .
"If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . ''"
"`` Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , '' I added ; `` the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . ''"
"`` They 'll have a hot run , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Jack ashore , you know ."
It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round-shot .
Carpet bowls !
My lady 's maid could n't miss .
"Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . ''"
"In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process ."
"We were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees ."
The gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes .
"The ebb-tide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants ."
The one source of danger was the gun .
"`` If I durst , '' said the captain , `` I 'd stop and pick off another man . ''"
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot .
"They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and I could see him trying to crawl away ."
`` Ready ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Hold ! ''
"cried the captain , quick as an echo ."
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water .
The report fell in at the same instant of time .
"This was the first that Jim heard , the sound of the squire 's shot not having reached him ."
"Where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster ."
"At any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet ."
"The other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling ."
So far there was no great harm .
"No lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety ."
"But there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service ."
"Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct ."
"As for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost ."
The other three had gone down with the boat .
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"""What would I have done without your help?"" she said. ""I was so dreadfully frightened. Don't you see how my paws are shaking still?"" And she held out the prettiest little paws imaginable for him to see."
"Then Mr. Red Squirrel's heart began to thump very fast and hard beneath the white fur of his chest, and he sighed softly. ""I wish I might always help you and protect you,"" he said; ""but I suppose there are better fellows than I who want to do that."" And he sighed again."
"""Yes, they might want to,"" she said, looking away from him and acting as though she saw another Blue Jay coming."
"""You wouldn't be my little wife, would you?"" he asked, coming nearer to her."
"""Why I might!"" she answered, with a saucy flirt of her tail, and she scampered away as fast as she could. Do you think Mr. Red Squirrel stopped then to eat his fat kernel of yellow corn? Or do you think he waited to see whether the Blue Jays were around? No, indeed! He followed as fast as his legs could carry him from tree to tree, from branch to branch, and it was not until he had reached the top of a tall beech that he overtook his little sweetheart. They were still there when the Gray Squirrel happened along in the afternoon."
"""Ah!"" said he, squinting at Mr. Red Squirrel, for his eyes were poor."
"""You are getting acquainted, are you? Pleasant society here. The Squirrel set is very select. You must meet some of our young people."
"Suppose you will begin housekeeping one of these days?"""
"""I have done so already, sir,"" answered Mr. Red Squirrel, although his wife was nudging him with one paw and motioning him to keep quiet. ""Mrs."
"Red Squirrel and I will build our round home in the top fork of this tree. We shall be pleased to have you call when we are settled."""
"""Is that so?"" exclaimed the Gray Squirrel. ""I did not know that you were married. I thought you came alone to the forest."""
"""This is my wife, sir,"" said Mr. Red Squirrel, and the Gray Squirrel made his very best bow and looked at her as sharply as his poor eyes would let him."
"""I think I must have seen you somewhere,"" he said; ""your face is very familiar."" And he scratched his poor old puzzled head with one claw."
"""Why, Cousin Gray Squirrel, don't you know Bushy-tail?"" she cried. ""You lived the next tree to mine all winter."""
"""To be sure!"" he exclaimed. ""But isn't your marriage rather sudden?"""
"""No,"" she said, blushing under her fur. ""We have always liked each other, although we never spoke until this morning. I used to scamper along the rail fence to see Mr. Red Squirrel in his cage."""
"""Did you truly come for that?"" asked her husband, after their caller had gone."
"""I truly did,"" she answered, ""but I never expected anybody to know it."
"You poor fellow! I felt so sorry for you. I would have given every nut I had to set you free."""
"They were a very happy couple, and the next fall the Gray Squirrel watched them and their children gathering nuts for their winter stores."
"Mr. Red Squirrel, as the head of the family, planned the work, yet each did his share. The nuts were not yet ripe, and they gnawed off the stems, then came to the ground, filled their cheek-pockets with the fallen nuts, and scampered off to hide them in many places. They were stored in tree-hollows, under the rustling leaves which strewed the ground, in the cracks of old logs, beneath brush-heaps, and in holes in the ground."
"""Don't stop to think how many you need,"" said the little mother to her children. ""Get every nut you can. It may be a very long winter."""
"""And if you don't eat them all,"" said their hard-working father with a twinkle in his eyes, ""you may want to drop a few down to some poor fellow who has none. That was your mother's way."""
"""When was it her way? What makes you smile when you say it? Mother, what does he mean?"" cried the young Red Squirrels all in a breath."
"""I gave some nuts to a hungry Squirrel once,"" she said, ""and he was so grateful that he drove the Blue Jays away when they tried to rob me."""
"But she looked so happy as she spoke that the children knew there was more to the story. They dared not tease her to tell, so they whispered among themselves and wondered what their father meant."
"As they gathered nuts near the Gray Squirrel, he motioned them to come close. ""S-sh!"" said he. ""Don't tell it from me, but I think the poor hungry fellow was your father, and it was a lucky thing for you that she had enough to give away."""
"""Do you suppose that was it?"" the young Red Squirrels whispered to each other. ""Do you really suppose so?"""
THE BIGGEST LITTLE RABBIT LEARNS TO SEE
"Seven little Rabbits lay on their nest at the bottom of the burrow, and wriggled and squirmed and pushed their soft noses against each other all day long. Life was very easy for them, and they were contented. The first thing that they remembered was lying on their bed of fur, hay, and dried leaves, and feeling a great, warm, soft Something close beside them. After a while they learned that this Something was their Mamma Rabbit. It was she who had gotten the nest ready for them and lined it with fur that she tore from her own breast. She didn't care so much about looking beautiful as she did about making her babies comfortable."
"It was their Mamma Rabbit, too, who fed them with warm milk from her own body until they should be old enough to go out of the burrow. Then they would nibble bark and tender young shoots from the roots of the trees, and all the fresh, green, growing things that Rabbits like. She used to tell them about this food, and they wondered and wondered how it would taste. They began to feel very big and strong now. The soft fur was growing on their naked little bodies and covering even the soles of their feet. It was growing inside their cheeks, too, and that made them feel important, for Papa Rabbit said that he did not know any other animals that had fur inside their cheeks. He said it was something to be very proud of, so they were very proud, although why one should want fur inside of one's cheeks it would be hard to say."
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
"Well they all said there could be but one voice and will as to that, and when Halvor heard that he wasn't long in throwing off his beggar's rags, and arraying himself as bridegroom."
"""Aye, aye, here is the right one after all,"" said the youngest Princess as soon as she saw him, and so she tossed the other one out of the window, and held her wedding with Halvor."
THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY
"Once on a time there was a King who had seven sons, and he loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be with him. Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but as for the youngest, his father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace. So the King gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred pounds, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came to a King who had six daughters; such lovely king's daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for Boots, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their own sweethearts."
"But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side, like a wall, where the Giant's house was, and there the Giant came out, and set his eyes upon them, and turned them all into stone, princes and princesses and all. Now the King waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad again."
"""And if I had not you left,"" he said to Boots, ""I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers."""
"""Well, but now I've been thinking to ask your leave to set out and find them again; that's what I'm thinking of,"" said Boots."
"""Nay, nay!"" said his father; ""that leave you shall never get, for then you would stay away too."""
"But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that the King was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the King had no other horse to give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his sorry old steed."
"""Farewell, father,"" said he; ""I'll come back, never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me;"" and with that he rode off."
"So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Raven, ""give me a little food, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""I haven't much food,"" said the Prince, ""and I don't see how you'll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it."""
So he gave the raven some of the food he had brought with him.
"Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into the water again."
"""Oh, dear friend,"" said the Salmon to the Prince; ""shove me out into the water again, and I'll help you again at your utmost need."""
"""Well!"" said the Prince, ""the help you'll give me will not be great, I daresay, but it's a pity you should lie there and choke;"" and with that he shot the fish out into the stream again."
"After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a Wolf which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on its belly."
"""Dear friend, do let me have your horse,"" said the Wolf; ""I'm so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I've had nothing to eat these two years."""
"""No,"" said Boots, ""this will never do; first I came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can't be done, that it can't, for then I should have nothing to ride on."""
"""Nay, dear friend, but you can help me,"" said Graylegs the wolf; ""you can ride upon my back, and I'll help you again in your utmost need."""
"""Well! the help I shall get from you will not be great, I'll be bound,"" said the Prince; ""but you may take my horse, since you are in such need."""
"So when the Wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took the bit and put it into the Wolf's jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the Wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before."
"""When we have gone a bit farther,"" said Graylegs, ""I'll show you the Giant's house."""
So after a while they came to it.
"""See, here is the Giant's house,"" said the Wolf; ""and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone; and see, here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in that door you must go."""
"""Nay, but I daren't go in,"" said the Prince; ""he'll take my life."""
"""No! no!"" said the Wolf; ""when you get in you'll find a Princess, and she'll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant. Only mind and do as she bids you."""
"Well! Boots went in, but, truth to say, he was very much afraid."
"When he came in the Giant was away, but in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the Wolf had said, and so lovely a princess Boots had never yet set eyes on."
"""Oh! heaven help you! whence have you come?"" said the Princess, as she saw him; ""it will surely be your death. No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his body."""
Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
And to each of them the little slyboots replied:
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin. Tum-pa, tum too;     Tum-pa, tum-too; Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
Then they all sighed to think of the tender little morsel they had let slip.
"At last the Jackal came limping along, for all his sorry looks as sharp as a needle, and he too called out"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Lambikin, curled up in his snug little nest, replied gaily:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin! Tum-pa  """
"But he never got any further, for the Jackal recognised his voice at once, and cried: ""Hullo! you've turned yourself inside out, have you?"
"Just you come out of that!"""
Whereupon he tore open Drumikin and gobbled up Lambikin.
Punchkin
Once upon a time there was a Raja who had seven beautiful daughters.
"They were all good girls; but the youngest, named Balna, was more clever than the rest. The Raja's wife died when they were quite little children, so these seven poor Princesses were left with no mother to take care of them."
"The Raja's daughters took it by turns to cook their father's dinner every day, whilst he was absent deliberating with his Ministers on the affairs of the nation."
"About this time the Prudhan died, leaving a widow and one daughter; and every day, every day, when the seven Princesses were preparing their father's dinner, the Prudhan's widow and daughter would come and beg for a little fire from the hearth. Then Balna used to say to her sisters, ""Send that woman away; send her away. Let her get the fire at her own house. What does she want with ours? If we allow her to come here, we shall suffer for it some day."""
"But the other sisters would answer, ""Be quiet, Balna; why must you always be quarrelling with this poor woman? Let her take some fire if she likes."" Then the Prudhan's widow used to go to the hearth and take a few sticks from it; and whilst no one was looking, she would quickly throw some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being prepared for the Raja's dinner."
"Now the Raja was very fond of his daughters. Ever since their mother's death they had cooked his dinner with their own hands, in order to avoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies. So, when he found the mud mixed up with his dinner, he thought it must arise from their carelessness, as it did not seem likely that any one should have put mud there on purpose; but being very kind he did not like to reprove them for it, although this spoiling of the curry was repeated many successive days."
"At last, one day, he determined to hide, and watch his daughters cooking, and see how it all happened; so he went into the next room, and watched them through a hole in the wall."
"There he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice and preparing the curry, and as each dish was completed, they put it by the fire ready to be cooked. Next he noticed the Prudhan's widow come to the door, and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinner with. Balna turned to her, angrily, and said, ""Why don't you keep fuel in your own house, and not come here every day and take ours? Sisters, don't give this woman any more wood; let her buy it for herself."""
"Then the eldest sister answered, ""Balna, let the poor woman take the wood and the fire; she does us no harm."" But Balna replied, ""If you let her come here so often, maybe she will do us some harm, and make us sorry for it, some day."""
"The Raja then saw the Prudhan's widow go to the place where all his dinner was nicely prepared, and, as she took the wood, she threw a little mud into each of the dishes."
"At this he was very angry, and sent to have the woman seized and brought before him. But when the widow came, she told him that she had played this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him; and she spoke so cleverly, and pleased him so well with her cunning words, that instead of punishing her, the Raja married her, and made her his Ranee, and she and her daughter came to live in the palace."
"Now the new Ranee hated the seven poor Princesses, and wanted to get them, if possible, out of the way, in order that her daughter might have all their riches, and live in the palace as Princess in their place; and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to her, she did all she could to make them miserable. She gave them nothing but bread to eat, and very little of that, and very little water to drink; so these seven poor little Princesses, who had been accustomed to have everything comfortable about them, and good food and good clothes all their lives long, were very miserable and unhappy; and they used to go out every day and sit by their dead mother's tomb and cry and say:"
"""Oh mother, mother, cannot you see your poor children, how unhappy we are, and how we are starved by our cruel step-mother?"""
"One day, whilst they were thus sobbing and crying, lo and behold! a beautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave, covered with fresh ripe pomeloes, and the children satisfied their hunger by eating some of the fruit, and every day after this, instead of trying to eat the bad dinner their step-mother provided for them, they used to go out to their mother's grave and eat the pomeloes which grew there on the beautiful tree."
"Then the Ranee said to her daughter, ""I cannot tell how it is, every day those seven girls say they don't want any dinner, and won't eat any; and yet they never grow thin nor look ill; they look better than you do. I cannot tell how it is."" And she bade her watch the seven Princesses, and see if any one gave them anything to eat."
"So next day, when the Princesses went to their mother's grave, and were eating the beautiful pomeloes, the Prudhan's daughter followed them, and saw them gathering the fruit."
"In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the outer edge, took a ""header"" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this wonderful story in a few words: ""This cat on September 23, 1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."""
A Brave Queen
"Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea."
"Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two daughters whom she loved very much."
"Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed."
"Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the foes of their beautiful queen."
"They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them."
The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous enemies of Boadicea and her people.
"In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat them cruelly."
"This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered together, they fell upon the Romans."
"There were so many of them, and they were so fierce, that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships."
"But there were many more Romans in other parts of Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni."
"The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves, but many of their brave men had been slain and others were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to win a victory over their strong foes."
"Before the battle, Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind, stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove to and fro, so that all might see them."
"And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen."
"They did fight long and bravely, until most of them were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten, she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel Romans."
King Alfred and the Cakes
"Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest."
"Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen."
"Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work."
"At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task."
"When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. ""You are an idle fellow,"" cried she angrily. ""You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them."""
"While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home. He knew King Alfred. ""Hush, wife!"" cried he. ""It is our noble lord the king!"""
"When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and she begged Alfred to forgive her."
"The king smiled, and said: ""I will gladly forgive you for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for spoiling your supper."""
"Not Angles, but Angels"
"In old days the people of England were not all free, as they are now."
"Sometimes young men, and women, and little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard for their masters."
"Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have them as their servants."
And he told them all about it.
"But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the matter in his hands."
"""But what about my baby?"" said John."
"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."""
"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale."
"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!"""
"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."""
"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet."
"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night."""
"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut."
"The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid."
"Good night, sir."""
"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began."
"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever."
"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night."""
The baby went on screaming.
"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?"""
"""I do, a little,"" said the mother."
"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes."""
"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby."
"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet."
"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town."""
"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."""
"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation."
"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain."
"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses."
"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week."
"The baby named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon."
"The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser."
"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town."
"""We're lost,"" said the mayor. ""I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats by his teeth."""
"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them."
"Once he was hard pressed for means, as he was trying to run a farm, and running a farm costs money: so he went to a bank to borrow. He hated to do it, because he had no special inducements to offer a bank or to make it hilariously loan him money."
"""How much did you think you would need, Mr. Webster?"" asked the President, cutting off some coupons as he spoke and making paper dolls of them."
"""Well, I could get along very well,"" said Webster, in that deep, resinous voice of his, ""if I could have two thousand dollars."""
"""Well, you remember,"" said the banker, ""do you not, that you have two thousand dollars here, that you deposited five years ago, after you had dined with the Governor of North Carolina?"""
"""No, I had forgotten about that,"" said Webster. ""Give me a blank check without unnecessary delay."""
We may learn from this that Mr. Webster was not a careful man in the matter of detail.
"His speech on the two-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was a good thing, and found its way into the press of the time."
"His speech at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, and his eulogy of Adams and Jefferson, were beautiful and thrilling."
"Daniel Webster had a very large brain, and used to loan his hat to brother Senators now and then when their heads were paining them, provided he did not want it himself."
"His reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in 1830, was regarded as one of his ablest parliamentary efforts. Hayne attacked New England, and first advanced the doctrine of nullification, which was even more dangerous than secession, Jefferson Davis in 1860 denying that he had ever advocated or favored such a doctrine."
"Webster spoke extempore, and people sent out for their lunch rather than go away in the midst of his remarks."
"Webster married twice, but did not let that make any difference with his duty to his country."
"He tried to farm it some, but did not amass a large sum, owing to his heavy losses in trying year after year to grow Saratoga potatoes for the Boston market."
"No American, foreign or domestic, ever made a greater name for himself than Daniel Webster, but he was not so good a penman as Noah; Noah was the better pen-writer."
"Noah Webster also had the better command of language of the two. Those who have read his great work entitled ""Webster's Elementary Spelling-Book, or, How One Word Led to Another,"" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never lacked for a word by which to express himself."
He was a brainy man and a good speller.
One by one our eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon Bonaparte is no more; and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away.
This has been a severe winter on Red Shirt; and I have to guard against the night air a good deal myself.
"It would ill become me, at this late date, to criticise Mr. Webster's work, a work that is now, I may say, in nearly every home and school-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr."
Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.
"I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks egotistical in me; but, although Noah's book is larger than mine, and has more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through."
"He has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour, perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer stepped down to 47° below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald married the girl or not. Mr. Webster did not seem to care how the affair turned out."
"Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He doesn't keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing, who secured one of my books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he seemed chained to the spot; and if you can't believe a convict who is entirely out of politics, whom, in the name of George Washington, can you trust?"
"Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, though a little inclined, perhaps, to be wordy. I have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike."
"This shows great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome."
"I had heard so much of Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is cold, methodical, dry, and dispassionate in the extreme, and one cannot help comparing it with the works of James Fenimore Cooper and Horace."
"As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of whiling away an idle hour. No one should travel without Mr. Webster's tale. Those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. He kept them off with this tale."
"It is a good book, as I say, to take up for a moment, or to read on the train, or to hold the door open on a hot day. I would never take a long railroad ride without it, eyether. I would as soon forget my bottle of cough-medicine."
"Mr. Webster's Speller had an immense sale. Ten years ago he had sold forty million copies. And yet it had this same defect. It was cold, dull, disconnected, and verbose. There was only one good thing in the book, and that was a little literary gem regarding a boy who broke in and stole the apples of a total stranger. The story was so good that I have often wondered whom Mr. Webster got to write it for him."
"The old man, it seems, at first told the boy that he had better come down, as there was a draught in the tree; but the young sass-box apple-sass-box, I presume told him to avaunt."
"Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it."
"It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who heard it."
"When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, ""I will catch her to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the others."" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, ""Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry."" He said, ""No. But from to-day, you and I are one."" So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly."
"Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit."
"The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying, ""You must have known it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me."" And that was all the revenge she took."
The Cruel Crane Outwitted
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
"Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish."
And a crane thought on seeing the fish:
"""I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."""
"And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it."
"When the fish saw him, they asked him, ""What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?"""
"""I am sitting thinking about you,"" said he."
"""Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?"" said they."
"""Why,"" he replied; ""there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, 'What in the world will these fish do now?'"""
"""Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?"" said they."
"""If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it,"" answered the crane."
"""That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at."""
"""Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."""
"Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore."
"Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond."
"And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, ""All right, sir! You may take us with you."""
"Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there."
"But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:"
"""I've thrown that fish in; let another one come."""
"And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more!"
"But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out:"
"""I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!"""
"""But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"""
"""I'll bite hold of you with my beak."""
"Boston ladies gave up tea and used the dried leaves of the raspberry, and the girls of 1777 graduated in homespun. Could the iron heel of despotism crunch such a spirit of liberty as that? Scarcely. In one family at Newport four hundred and eighty-seven yards of cloth and thirty-six pairs of stockings were spun and made in eighteen months."
"When the war broke out it is estimated that each Colonial soldier had twenty-seven pairs of blue woollen socks with white double heels and toes. Does the intelligent reader believe that ""Tommy Atkins,"" with two pairs of socks ""and hit a-rainin',"" could whip men with twenty-seven pairs each? Not without restoratives."
"Troops were now sent to restore order. They were clothed by the British government, but boarded around with the Colonists. This was irritating to the people, because they had never met or called on the British troops. Again, they did not know the troops were coming, and had made no provision for them."
"Boston was considered the hot-bed of the rebellion, and General Gage was ordered to send two regiments of troops there. He did so, and a fight ensued, in which three citizens were killed."
"In looking over this incident, we must not forget that in those days three citizens went a good deal farther than they do now."
"The fight, however, was brief. General Gage, getting into a side street, separated from his command, and, coming out on the Common abruptly, he tried eight or nine more streets, but he came out each time on the Common, until, torn with conflicting emotions, he hired a Herdic, which took him around the corner to his quarters."
"On December 16, 1773, occurred the tea-party at Boston, which must have been a good deal livelier than those of to-day. The historian regrets that he was not there; he would have tried to be the life of the party."
"England had finally so arranged the price of tea that, including the tax, it was cheaper in America than in the old country. This exasperated the patriots, who claimed that they were confronted by a theory and not a condition. At Charleston this tea was stored in damp cellars, where it spoiled. New York and Philadelphia returned their ships, but the British would not allow any shenanegin', as George III. so tersely termed it, in Boston."
"Therefore a large party met in Faneuil Hall and decided that the tea should not be landed. A party made up as Indians, and, going on board, threw the tea overboard. Boston Harbor, as far out as the Bug Light, even to-day, is said to be carpeted with tea-grounds."
"George III. now closed Boston harbor and made General Gage Governor of Massachusetts. The Virginia Assembly murmured at this, and was dissolved and sent home without its mileage."
"Those opposed to royalty were termed Whigs, those in favor were called Tories. Now they are called Chappies or Authors."
"On the 5th of September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia and was entertained by the Clover Club. Congress acted slowly even then, and after considerable delay resolved that the conduct of Great Britain was, under the circumstances, uncalled for. It also voted to hold no intercourse with Great Britain, and decided not to visit Shakespeare's grave unless the mother-country should apologize."
"In 1775, on the 19th of April, General Gage sent out troops to see about some military stores at Concord, but at Lexington he met with a company of minute-men gathering on the village green. Major Pitcairn, who was in command of the Tommies, rode up to the minute-men, and, drawing his bright new Sheffield sword, exclaimed, ""Disperse, you rebels! throw down your arms and disperse!"" or some such remark as that."
"The Americans hated to do that, so they did not. In the skirmish that ensued, seven of their number were killed."
"Thus opened the Revolutionary War, a contest which but for the earnestness and irritability of the Americans would have been extremely brief. It showed the relative difference between the fighting qualities of soldiers who fight for two pounds ten shillings per month and those who fight because they have lost their temper."
"The regulars destroyed the stores, but on the way home they found every rock-pile hid an old-fashioned gun and minute-man. This shows that there must have been an enormous number of minute-men then. All the English who got back to Boston were those who went out to reinforce the original command."
"The news went over the country like wildfire. These are the words of the historian. Really, that is a poor comparison, for wildfire doesn't jump rivers and bays, or get up and eat breakfast by candle-light in order to be on the road and spread the news."
"General Putnam left a pair of tired steers standing in the furrow, and rode one hundred miles without feed or water to Boston."
"Twenty thousand men were soon at work building intrenchments around Boston, so that the English troops could not get out to the suburbs where many of them resided."
I will now speak of the battle of Bunker Hill.
"This battle occurred June 17. The Americans heard that their enemy intended to fortify Bunker Hill, and so they determined to do it themselves, in order to have it done in a way that would be a credit to the town."
"A body of men under Colonel Prescott, after prayer by the President of Harvard University, marched to Charlestown Neck. They decided to fortify Breed's Hill, as it was more commanding, and all night long they kept on fortifying. The surprise of the English at daylight was well worth going from Lowell to witness."
"Howe sent three thousand men across and formed them on the landing. He marched them up the hill to within ten rods of the earth-works, when it occurred to Prescott that it would now be the appropriate thing to fire."
"He made a statement of that kind to his troops, and those of the enemy who were alive went back to Charlestown. But that was no place for them, as they had previously set it afire, so they came back up the hill, where they were once more well received and tendered the freedom of a future state."
"Three times the English did this, when the ammunition in the fortifications gave out, and they charged with fixed bayonets and reinforcements."
"The Americans were driven from the field, but it was a victory after all. It united the Colonies and made them so vexed at the English that it took some time to bring on an era of good feeling."
"Lord Howe, referring afterwards to this battle, said that the Americans did not stand up and fight like the regulars, suggesting that thereafter the Colonial army should arrange itself in the following manner before a battle!"
"Washington decided that he must strike a daring blow while his troops had any hope or vitality left; and so on Christmas night, after crossing the Delaware as shown elsewhere, he fell on the Hessians at Trenton in the midst of their festivities, captured one thousand prisoners, and slew the leader."
"The Hessians were having a symposium at the time, and though the commander received an important note of warning during the Christmas dinner, he thrust it into his pocket and bade joy be unconfined."
"When daylight came, the Hessians were mostly moving in alcoholic circles trying to find their guns. Washington lost only four men, and two of those were frozen to death."
The result of this fight gave the Colonists courage and taught them at the same time that it would be best to avoid New Jersey symposiums till after the war was over.
"Having made such a hit in crossing the Delaware, Washington decided to repeat the performance on the 3d of January. He was attacked at Trenton by Cornwallis, who is known in history for his justly celebrated surrender. He waited till morning, having been repulsed at sundown."
"Washington left his camp-fires burning, surrounded the British, captured two hundred prisoners, and got away to Morristown Heights in safety. If the ground had not frozen, General Washington could not have moved his forty cannon; but, fortunately, the thermometer was again on his side, and he never lost a gun."
"September 11 the English got into the Chesapeake, and Washington announced in the papers that he would now fight the battle of the Brandywine, which he did."
"Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot from under him."
"The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia."
"October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the dullest winter of his life."
"The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way."
"A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life."
"He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's troops by a neck."
"Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the militia. Stark said, ""Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow."" This neat little remark made an instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian."
"Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks."
"He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British wit had it, ""gave Gates ajar,"" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks."
"Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open fire."
"Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle, probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command, and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp."
"Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold."
"A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent compositions ever composed."
During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.
"Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to rest and dream of food and freedom."
Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of such heroic sires.
Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination of his personal record.
"In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the struggling troops."
"The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and, alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better facilities for getting home."
"Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a retreat."
"Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him and went away where they could be by themselves."
"From this on to the Revolution, Massachusetts, Maine, and Nova Scotia became a royal province. Nova Scotia is that way yet, and has to go to Boston for her groceries."
"The year 1692 is noted mostly for the Salem excitement regarding witchcraft. The children of Rev. Mr. Parris were attacked with some peculiar disease which would not yield to the soothing blisters and bleedings administered by the physicians of the old school, and so, not knowing exactly what to do about it, the doctors concluded that they were bewitched. Then it was, of course, the duty of the courts and selectmen to hunt up the witches. This was naturally difficult."
"Fifty-five persons were tortured and twenty were hanged for being witches; which proves that the people of Salem were fully abreast of the Indians in intelligence, and that their gospel privileges had not given their charity and Christian love such a boom as they should have done."
"One can hardly be found now, even in Salem, who believes in witchcraft; though the Cape Cod people, it is said, still spit on their bait. The belief in witchcraft in those days was not confined by any means to the colonists. Sir Matthew Hale of England, one of the most enlightened judges of the mother-country, condemned a number of people for the offence, and is now engaged in doing road-work on the streets of the New Jerusalem as a punishment for these acts done while on the woolsack."
"Blackstone himself, one of the dullest authors ever read by the writer of these lines, yet a skilled jurist, with a marvellous memory regarding Justinian, said that, to deny witchcraft was to deny revelation."
"""Be you a witch?"" asked one of the judges of Massachusetts, according to the records now on file in the State-House at Boston."
"""No, your honor,"" was the reply."
"""Officer,"" said the court, taking a pinch of snuff, ""take her out on the tennis-grounds and pull out her toe-nails with a pair of hot pincers, and then see what she says."""
"It was quite common to examine lady witches in the regular court and then adjourn to the tennis-court. A great many were ducked by order of the court and hanged up by the thumbs, in obedience to the customs of these people who came to America because they were persecuted."
"Human nature is the same even to this day. The writer grew up with an Irishman who believed that when a man got wealthy enough to keep a carriage and coachman he ought to be assassinated and all his goods given to the poor. He now hires a coachman himself, having succeeded in New York city as a policeman; but the man who comes to assassinate him will find it almost impossible to obtain an audience with him."
"If you wish to educate a man to be a successful oppressor, with a genius for introducing new horrors and novelties in pain, oppress him early in life and don't give him any reason for doing so. The idea that ""God is love"" was not popular in those days. The early settlers were so stern even with their own children that if the Indian had not given the forefather something to attract his attention, the boy crop would have been very light."
"Even now the philosopher is led to ask, regarding the boasted freedom of America, why some measures are not taken to put large fly-screens over it."
CHAPTER VI.
THE EPISODE OF THE CHARTER OAK.
The Colonies of Maine and New Hampshire were so closely associated with that of Massachusetts that their history up to 1820 was practically the same.
"Shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims, say two years or thereabouts, Gorges and Mason obtained from England the grant of a large tract lying between the Merrimac and Kennebec Rivers. This patent was afterwards dissolved, Mason taking what is now New Hampshire, and Gorges taking Maine. He afterwards sold the State to Massachusetts for six thousand dollars. The growth of the State may be noticed since that time, for one county cost more than that last November."
"In 1820 Maine was separated from Massachusetts. Maine is noted for being the easternmost State in the Union, and has been utilized by a number of eminent men as a birthplace. White-birch spools for thread, Christmas-trees, and tamarack and spruce-gum are found in great abundance. It is the home of an industrious and peace-loving people."
Bar Harbor is a cool place to go to in summer-time and violate the liquor law of the State.
"The Dutch were first to claim Connecticut. They built a trading-post at Hartford, where they swapped bone collar-buttons with the Indians for beaver-and otter-skins. Traders from Plymouth who went up the river were threatened by the Dutch, but they pressed on and established a post at Windsor."
"In 1635, John Steele led a company ""out west"" to Hartford, and Thomas Hooker, a clergyman, followed with his congregation, driving their stock before them. Hartford thus had quite a boom quite early in the seventeenth century. The Dutch were driven out of the Connecticut Valley, and began to look towards New York."
"Soon after this the Pequod War broke out. These Indians had hoped to form an alliance with the Narragansetts, but Roger Williams prevented this by seeing the Narragansett chief personally. Thus the Puritans had coals of fire heaped on their heads by their gentle pastor, until the odor of burning hair could be detected as far away as New Haven."
"The Pequods were thus compelled to fight alone, and Captain Mason by a coup d'état surrounded their camp before daylight and entered the palisades with the Indian picket, who cried out ""Owanux! Owanux!"""
"meaning ""Englishmen. Englishmen."" Mason and his men killed these Pequods and burned their lodges to the ground. There has never been a prosperous Pequod lodge since. Those who escaped to the forest were shot down like jack-rabbits as they fled, and there has been no Pequoding done since that time."
"The New Haven Colony was founded in 1638 by wealthy church members from abroad. They took the Bible as their standard and statute. They had no other law. Only church members could vote, which was different from the arrangements in New York City in after-years."
"The Connecticut Colony had a regular constitution, said to have been the first written constitution ever adopted by the people, framed for the people by the people. It was at once prosperous, and soon bought out the Saybrook Colony."
"In 1662 a royal charter was obtained which united the two above colonies and guaranteed to the people the rights agreed upon by them. It amounted to a duly-authenticated independence. A quarter of a century afterwards Governor Andros, in his other clothes and a reigning coat of red and gold trimmings, marched into the Assembly and demanded this precious charter."
"Cornwallis in this Virginia and Southern trip destroyed ten million dollars' worth of property, and then fortified himself at Yorktown."
"Washington decided to besiege Yorktown, and, making a feint to fool Clinton, set out for that place, visiting Mount Vernon en route after an absence of six and a half years, though only stopping two days."
"Washington was a soldier in the true sense, and, when a lad, was given a little hatchet by his father. George cut down some cherry-trees with this, in order to get the cherries without climbing the trees. One day his father discovered that the trees had been cut down, and spoke of it to the lad."
"""Yes,"" said George, ""I did it with my little hatchet; but I would rather cut down a thousand cherry-trees and tell the truth about it than be punished for it."""
"""Well said, my brave boy!"" exclaimed the happy father as he emptied George's toy bank into his pocket in payment for the trees. ""You took the words right out of my mouth."""
"In speaking of the siege of Yorktown, the historian says, ""The most hearty good will prevailed."" What more could you expect of a siege than that?"
"Cornwallis capitulated October 19. It was the most artistic capitulation he had ever given. The troops were arranged in two lines facing each other, British and American with their allies the French under Rochambeau."
"People came from all over the country who had heard of Cornwallis and his wonderful genius as a capitulator. They came for miles, and brought their lunches with them; but the general, who felt an unnecessary pique towards Washington, refused to take part in the exercises himself, claiming that by the advice of his physicians he would have to remain in his tent, as they feared that he had over-capitulated himself already."
"He therefore sent his sword by General O'Hara, and Washington turned it over to Lincoln, who had been obliged to surrender to the English at Charleston."
"The news reached Philadelphia in the night, and when the watchman cried, ""Past two o'clock, and Cornwallis is taken!"" the people arose and went and prayed and laughed like lunatics, for they regarded the war as virtually ended. The old door-keeper of Congress died of delight. Thanks were returned to Almighty God, and George Washington's nomination was a sure thing."
"England decided that whoever counselled war any further was a public enemy, and Lord North, then prime minister, when he heard of the surrender of Cornwallis through a New York paper, exclaimed, ""Oh, God!"
"it is all over!"""
"Washington now showed his sagacity in quelling the fears of the soldiers regarding their back pay. He was invited to become king, but, having had no practice, and fearing that he might run against a coup d'état or faux pas, he declined, and spoke kindly against taking violent measures."
"In 1783, September 3, a treaty of peace was signed in Paris, and Washington, delivering the most successful farewell address ever penned, retired to Mount Vernon, where he began at once to enrich his farm with the suggestions he had received during his absence, and to calmly take up the life that had been interrupted by the tedious and disagreeable war."
"The country was free and independent, but, oh, how ignorant it was about the science of government! The author does not wish to be personal when he states that the country at that time did not know enough about affairs to carry water for a circus elephant."
"It was heavily in debt, with no power to raise money. New England refused to pay her poll-tax, and a party named Shays directed his hired man to overturn the government; but a felon broke out on his thumb, and before he could put it down the crisis was averted and the country saved."
CHAPTER XIX.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
"It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon to the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation."
"Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him. He was asked at all the towns to build there, and 'most everybody wanted him ""to come and make their house his home."" When he got to the ferry he was not pushed off into the water by commuters, but lived to reach the Old Federal Hall, where he was sworn in."
"In 1791 the seat of government was removed to Philadelphia, where it remained for ten years, after which the United States took advantage of the Homestead Act and located on a tract of land ten miles square, known as the District of Columbia. In 1846 that part of the District lying on the Virginia side of the Potomac was ceded back to the State."
"President Washington did not have to escape from the capital to avoid office-seekers. He could get on a horse at his door and in five minutes be out of sight. He could remain in the forest back of his house until Martha blew the horn signifying that the man who wanted the post-office at Pigback had gone, and then he could return."
"How times have changed with the growth of the republic! Now Pigback has grown so that the name has been changed to Hogback, and the President avails himself of every funeral that he can possibly feel an interest in, to leave the swarm of jobless applicants who come to pester him to death for appointments."
The historian begs leave to say here that the usefulness of the President for the good of his country and the consideration of greater questions will some day be reduced to very little unless he may be able to avoid this effort to please voters who overestimate their greatness.
"It is said that Washington had no library, which accounted for his originality. He was a vestryman in the Episcopal Church; and to see his tall and graceful form as he moved about from pew to pew collecting pence for Home Missions, was a lovely sight."
As a boy he was well behaved and a careful student.
"At one time he was given a hatchet by his father, which"
But what has the historian to do with this morbid wandering in search of truth?
"Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on the dragon's head and said: ""Can I be of any assistance?"""
"Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say nothing else. So the white grouse said: ""One moment. I am only too grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct about the firework!"""
"And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and only their faces peeped out."
"""Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,"" said Jane, ""but you'll be cold yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear feathers?"""
"The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind, soft bird voices."
"""Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts warm!"""
"Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners."
"So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk."
"The dragon had not moved yet but then he might at any moment get warm enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:"
"""You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you."
"What more can you possibly want?"""
"Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: ""Oh, do mind your wings in the fires!"""
For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.
"""What's the matter?"" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail."
So they told him.
"""Sealskin, are they?"" said the moth. ""Just you wait a minute!"""
"He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and the stars."
And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.
"For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls, and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the sealskin fur."
"Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children who eat fur but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When they are not thinking about you they say, ""I fear the moths have got at my ermine tippet,"" or, ""Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak, but it was eaten by moths."" And now there were more moths than have ever been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs."
"The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the very life and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat bare pelts."
"""Oh, thank you thank you, darling Arctic moth,"" cried Jane. ""You are good I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you afterward!"""
"Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings, ""We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves once in a while to oblige a friend."""
"And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!"
"""Oh, dear,"" said Jane, ""this is the worst of all!"""
"""We've no friends left to help us,"" said George. He never thought that the dragon himself might help them but then that was an idea that would never have occurred to any boy."
"It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers the children shivered."
"Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy length over the snow, and said: ""This is something like! How faint those fires did make me feel!"""
"The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die."
"But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and Jane, because they were frozen to his back."
"He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling south with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a million ways of going south from the North Pole so you will own that it was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed, between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace."
"A long debate ensued, and, according to tradition, while the members of the Assembly stood around the table taking a farewell look at the charter, one of the largest members of the house fell on the governor's breast and wept so copiously on his shirt-frill that harsh words were used by his Excellency; a general quarrel ensued, the lights went out, and when they were relighted the charter was gone."
"Captain Wadsworth had taken it and concealed it in a hollow tree, since called the Charter Oak. After Andros was ejected from the Boston office, the charter was brought out again, and business under it was resumed."
"Important documents, however, should not be, as a general thing, secreted in trees. The author once tried this while young, and when engaged to, or hoping to become engaged to, a dear one whose pa was a singularly coarse man and who hated a young man who came as a lover at his daughter's feet with nothing but a good education and his great big manly heart. He wanted a son-in-law with a brewery; and so he bribed the boys of the neighborhood to break up a secret correspondence between the two young people and bring the mail to him. This was the cause of many a heart-ache, and finally the marriage of the sweet young lady to a brewer who was mortgaged so deeply that he wandered off somewhere and never returned. Years afterwards the brewery needed repairs, and one of the large vats was found to contain all of the missing man that would not assimilate with the beer, viz., his watch. Quite a number of people at that time quit the use of beer, and the author gave his hand in marriage to a wealthy young lady who was attracted by his gallantry and fresh young beauty."
"Roger Williams now settled at Providence Plantation, where he was joined by Mrs. Hutchinson, who also believed that the church and state should not be united, but that the state should protect the church and that neither should undertake to boss the other. It was also held that religious qualifications should not be required of political aspirants, also that no man should be required to whittle his soul into a shape to fit the religious auger-hole of another."
"This was the beginning of Rhode Island. She desired at once to join the New England Colony, but was refused, as she had no charter. Plymouth claimed also to have jurisdiction over Rhode Island. This was very much like Plymouth."
"Having banished Roger Williams and Mrs. Hutchinson to be skinned by the Pequods and Narragansetts over at Narragansett Pier, they went on about their business, flogging Quakers, also ducking old women who had lumbago, and burning other women who would not answer affirmatively when asked, ""Be you a witch?"""
"Then when Roger began to make improvements and draw the attention of Eastern capital to Rhode Island and to organize a State or Colony with a charter, Plymouth said, ""Hold on, Roger: religiously we have cast you out, to live on wild strawberries, clams, and Indians, but from a mercantile and political point of view you will please notice that we have a string which you will notice is attached to your wages and discoveries."""
"Afterwards, however, Roger Williams obtained the necessary funds from admiring friends with which to go to England and obtain a charter which united the Colonies yet gave to all the first official right to liberty of conscience ever granted in Europe or America. Prior to that a man's conscience had a brass collar on it with the royal arms engraved thereon, and was kept picketed out in the king's grounds. The owner could go and look at it on Sundays, but he never had the use of it."
"With the advent of freedom of political opinion, the individual use of the conscience has become popularized, and the time is coming when it will grow to a great size under our wise institutions and fostering skies. Instead of turning over our consciences to the safety deposit company of a great political party or religious organization and taking the key in our pocket, let us have individual charge of this useful little instrument and be able finally to answer for its growth or decay."
CHAPTER VII.
THE DISCOVERY OF NEW YORK.
The author will now refer to the discovery of the Hudson River and the town of New York via Fort Lee and the 125th Street Ferry.
"New York was afterwards sold for twenty-four dollars, the whole island."
"When I think of this I go into my family gallery, which I also use as a swear room, and tell those ancestors of mine what I think of them. Where were they when New York was sold for twenty-four dollars? Were they having their portraits painted by Landseer, or their deposition taken by Jeffreys, or having their Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes made?"
"Do not encourage them to believe that they will escape me in future years. Some of them died unregenerate, and are now, I am told, in a country where they may possibly be damned; and I will attend to the others personally."
"Twenty-four dollars for New York! Why, my Croton-water tax on one house and lot with fifty feet four and one-fourth inches front is fifty-nine dollars and no questions asked. Why, you can't get a voter for that now."
"Henry or Hendrik Hudson was an English navigator, of whose birth and early history nothing is known definitely, hence his name is never mentioned in many of the best homes in New York."
"In 1607 he made a voyage in search of the Northwest Passage. In one of his voyages he discovered Cape Cod, and later on the Hudson River."
This was one hundred and seventeen years after Columbus discovered America; which shows that the discovering business was not pushed as it should have been by those who had it in charge.
"Hudson went up the river as far as Albany, but, finding no one there whom he knew, he hastened back as far as 209th Street West, and anchored."
"He discovered Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and made other journeys by water, though aquatting was then in its infancy. Afterwards his sailors became mutinous, and set Hendrik and his son, with seven infirm sailors, afloat."
Ah! Whom have we here?
"It is Hendrik Hudson, who discovered the Hudson River."
"Here he has just landed at the foot of 209th Street, New York, where he offered the Indians liquor, but they refused."
How 209th Street has changed!
The artist has been fortunate in getting the expression of the Indians in the act of refusing. Mr. Hudson's great reputation lies in the fact that he discovered the river which bears his name; but the thinking mind will at once regard the discovery of an Indian who does not drink as far more wonderful.
"Some historians say that this especial delegation was swept away afterward by a pestilence, whilst others commenting on the incident maintain that Hudson lied."
"Whiskey will not make a poet, nor poker a great pleader. And yet I have seen poets who relied on the potency of their breath, and lawyers who knew more of the habits of a bobtail flush than they ever did of the statutes in such case made and provided."
"George Washington was always ready. If you wanted a man to be first in war, you could call on George. If you desired an adult who would be first baseman in time of peace, Mr. Washington could be telephoned at any hour of the day or night. If you needed a man to be first in the hearts of his countrymen, George's post-office address was at once secured."
"Though he was a great man, he was once a poor boy. How often you hear that in America! Here it is a positive disadvantage to be born wealthy."
And yet sometimes I wish they had experimented a little that way on me.
"I do not ask now to be born rich, of course, because it is too late; but it seems to me that, with my natural good sense and keen insight into human nature, I could have struggled along under the burdens and cares of wealth with great success. I do not care to die wealthy, but if I could have been born wealthy it seems to me I would have been tickled almost to death."
"I love to believe that true greatness is not accidental. To think and to say that greatness is a lottery, is pernicious. Man may be wrong sometimes in his judgment of others, both individually and in the aggregate, but he who gets ready to be a great man will surely find the opportunity."
"You will wonder whom I got to write this sentiment for me, but you will never find out."
"In conclusion, let me say that George Washington was successful for three reasons. One was that he never shook the confidence of his friends. Another was that he had a strong will without being a mule."
Some people cannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue donkey.
"Another reason why Washington is loved and honored to-day is that he died before we had a chance to get tired of him. This is greatly superior to the method adopted by many modern statesmen, who wait till their constituency weary of them, and then reluctantly pass away."
CHAPTER XIII.
CONTRASTS WITH THE PRESENT DAY.
"Here it may be well to speak briefly of the contrast between the usages and customs of the period preceding the Revolution, and the present day."
"Some of these customs and regulations have improved with the lapse of time, others undoubtedly have not."
"Two millions of people constituted the entire number of whites, while away to the westward the red brother extended indefinitely. Religiously they were Protestants, and essentially they were ""a God-fearing people."""
"Taught to obey a power they were afraid of, they naturally turned with delight to the service of a God whose genius in the erection of a boundless and successful hell challenged their admiration and esteem."
"So, too, their own executions of Divine laws were successful as they gave pain, and the most beautiful features of Christianity, namely, love and charity, according to history, were not cultivated very much."
"There were in New England at one time twelve offences punishable with death, and in Virginia seventeen. This would indicate that the death-penalty is getting unpopular very fast, and that in the contiguous future humane people will wonder why murder should have called for murder, in this brainy, charitable, and occult age, in which man seems almost able to pry open the future and catch a glimpse of Destiny underneath the great tent that has heretofore held him off by means of death's prohibitory rates."
In Hartford people had to get up when the town watchman rang his bell.
"The affairs of the family, and private matters too numerous to mention, were regulated by the selectmen. The catalogues of Harvard and Yale were regulated according to the standing of the family as per record in the old country, and not as per bust measurement and merit, as it is to-day."
"Scolding women, however, were gagged and tied to their front doors, so that the populace could bite its thumb at them, and hired girls received fifty dollars a year, with the understanding that they were not to have over two days out each week, except Sunday and the days they had to go and see their ""sick sisters."""
"Some cloth-weaving was indulged in, and homespun was the principal material used for clothing. Mrs. Washington had sixteen spinning-wheels in her house. Her husband often wore homespun while at home, and on rainy days sometimes placed a pair of home-made trousers of the barn-door variety in the Presidential chair."
"Money was very scarce, and ammunition very valuable. In 1635 musket-balls passed for farthings, and to see a New England peasant making change with the red brother at thirty yards was a common and delightful scene."
"The first press was set up in Cambridge in 1639, with the statement that it ""had come to stay."" Books printed in those days were mostly sermons filled with the most comfortable assurance that the man who let loose his intellect and allowed it to disbelieve some very difficult things would be essentially  well, I hate to say right here in a book what would happen to him."
"The first daily paper, called The Federal Orrery, was issued three hundred years after Columbus discovered America. It was not popular, and killed off the news-boys who tried to call it on the streets: so it perished."
"There was a public library in New York, from which books were loaned at fourpence ha'penny per week. New York thus became very early the seat of learning, and soon afterwards began to abuse the site where Chicago now stands."
"Travel was slow, the people went on horseback or afoot, and when they could go by boat it was regarded as a success. Wagons finally made the trip from New York to Philadelphia in the wild time of forty-eight hours, and the line was called The Flying Dutchman, or some other euphonious name. Benjamin Franklin, whose biography occurs in Chapter XV., was then Postmaster-General."
"He was the first bald-headed man of any prominence in the history of America. He and his daughter Sally took a trip in a chaise, looking over the entire system, and going to all offices. Nothing pleased the Postmaster-General like quietly slipping into a place like Sandy Bottom and catching the postmaster reading over the postal cards and committing them to memory."
"[She holds up her bare arms, with a motion of flight.]"
"MALISE.  [Admiring her] Ah-h-h!  [Then, as she drops her arms"
suddenly]  Play me something.
CLARE.  [Going to the piano]  I'm awfully grateful to you.  You don't
make me feel just an attractive female.  I wanted somebody like that.

be ugly.

"dark hair and a quick eye.  He, one of those clean-shaven naval"
"men of good presence who have retired from the sea, but not from"
their susceptibility.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Kissing CLARE, and taking in both MALISE and her"
husband's look at CLARE]  We've only come for a minute.
CLARE.  They're playing Bridge in the dining-room.  Mr. Malise
"doesn't play.  Mr. Malise--Mrs. Fullarton, Mr. Fullarton."
[They greet.]
"FULLARTON.  Most awfully jolly dress, Mrs. Dedmond."
CLARE.  [Shaking her head]  Reggie lives on his pay.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [With one of her quick looks]  That was Mr. Malise,"
then?
"FULLARTON.  [Coming towards them]  I say, Mrs. Dedmond, you wouldn't"
"sing me that little song you sang the other night,  [He hums]  ""If I"
"might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day""?  Remember?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  ""The falling dew,"" Edward.  We simply must go,"
Clare.  Good-night.  [She kisses her.]
FULLARTON.  [Taking half-cover between his wife and CLARE]  It suits
you down to the ground-that dress.
CLARE.  Good-night.
"HUNTINGDON sees them out.  Left alone CLARE clenches her hands,"
"moves swiftly across to the window, and stands looking out."
"HUNTINGDON.  [Returning]  Look here, Clare!"
"CLARE.  Well, Reggie?"
"HUNTINGDON.  This is working up for a mess, old girl.  You can't do"
this kind of thing with impunity.  No man'll put up with it.  If
"you've got anything against George, better tell me.  [CLARE shakes"
her head]  You ought to know I should stick by you.  What is it?
Come?

The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans

"Calendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding"
years began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the

The Jewish converts who at first composed the church had a rich heritage
"of song in the Book of Psalms. This was their hymnbook, used in the"
Temple worship and in the home and probably also in the synagogue
"services. The use of the Psalms, carried over from the Jewish service,"
forms to this day an important element in Christian worship.
"Besides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn"
the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use
"of _Hallelujah_ as a part of the people’s praise, adding, in the course"
"of time, the _Gloria Patri_, the _Sanctus_, the _Te Deum_, and other"
canticles.

"down beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:"
"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"

'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod
"down the passage, and though I knocked again in a rage, the door"
remained closed.
"I fell back and looked at the house. An elderly man in a grave, sober"
"dress was passing, among others, and I caught his eye."
'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of

is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'

After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few

"miserably. Besides, she was a girl."
"All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could"

"him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a"
little better.
"The door opened on the signal, ""Sesame."" When Butt saw somebody was"
"with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his"
fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.
"He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered"
his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump
when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.
"""An honor, Miss Sparling,"" he said in that rumbly voice. ""Please come"
"right in. There's a hurry-up draft."""
So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the

The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"

"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"

Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""

“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”

THE BRIEF DÉBUT OF TILDY
"""Awake, Alice?"" Norton asked brightly."
"""Awake again,"" she said unhappily. ""For.... What is it? The ninth day?"""
"""Eighth,"" he said. ""Can't go on much longer."""
"""I hope not."""
"""You look all in,"" he said softly. He sat down on the edge of the"
"divan, beside her, and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. ""Take it"
"easy, m'lady. They're really scouring space for us. We'll be all right."
"You'll see."""
*       *       *       *       *
Unexpectedly he bent and kissed her chastely on the forehead. Alice
"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"
"closer. Every lonely hour means that it can't be many more, because"
"they've covered all the places where we weren't. Follow me, Alice?"""
She shook her head unhappily.
"entirely here. This place belongs to her."""
"""And you?"""
"""I? I have just been released from prison in London, Holloway"
"Prison..."""
"""My dear young lady! You are surely joking--what do you say? You"
pull my leg? But no; I see! You have been Suffragette. Aha! _I_
"understand you are _the_ Miss Warren, the Miss Warren who make the"
"English Government afraid, nicht wahr? You set fire to Houses of"
"Parliament..."""
"_Vivie_ (interrupting): ""No, no! Only to some racing stables..."""
"_Oberst_: ""I understand. But you are rebel?"""
"_Vivie_: ""I hate the present British Government--the most"
"hypocritical, the most..."""
"_Oberst_: ""But we are in agreement, you and I! This is splendid. But"
"now we must be praktisch. We are at war, though we hope here for a"
"peaceful occupation of Belgium. You will see how the Flämisch--Ah,"
you say the Fleming?--the Flemish part of Belgium will receive us
"with such pleasure. It is only with the Wälsch, the Wallon part we"
disagree.... But there is so much for me to do--we must talk of all
these things some other time. Let us begin our business. I must
first introduce myself. I am Oberst Gottlieb von Giesselin of the
"Saxon Army. (He rose, clicked heels, bowed, and sat down.) I see you"
"have three heavy bags you look at often. What is it?"""
"_Vivie_ (taking courage): ""It is my mother's jewellery and some"
"He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He staggered"
"backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the light"
came on.
"""Yuri Andreevich, so this is where you are. What are you doing here?"""
"It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child again,"
caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?
"""I'm--I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I couldn't"
"sleep."""
"""Don't lie to me."" Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows gathered into the"
"skeptical furrow Yuri knew so well. ""You're up to something, another of"
"your tricks."""
Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?
"""_Moi otyets_, why are you here? You should be getting your sleep."""
"""I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you might be in"
"here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were planning"
"something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is."""
Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.
"No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be ironclad."
"""It's better if you don't know."""
"""As you wish,"" the old man sighed. ""But if you do something foolish . ."
"."""
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"
"puckalow that case and foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a"
"tablecloth as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."""
When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your
"name Sapristi?"""
"""Nom de Dieu----"" began the Frenchman, but Jones waved his hand with"
dignity.
"""Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you got anythin' in the way of"
"a marlinspike or a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"""
"""Gee, how'd you ever get away?"" asked Lav, admiringly, but Sidney had"
"no opportunity to explain for at that moment Mart joined them, eager"
and excited.
"""I put some cookies in my pocket,"" she exclaimed. ""You can't tell"
"what'll happen."""
"""Good. And I've got matches."""
Sidney wished she had thought of something to bring. Lav went on:
"""It isn't dark enough to go out yet. We got to be awful careful. You"
"girls sort o' walk up the beach as though we weren't all together."""
Lavender was actually pale and his eyes burned fiercely. Sidney looked
at him admiringly. She knew he was not thinking of the reward but of
the fair name of the Cape.
"Obediently the girls strolled up the beach. And, as they turned, a"
voice hailed them. To their consternation Pola came flying toward them.
At sight of her Sidney bit her lips with vexation. She gave a sidewise
glance at Mart and saw Mart's chin set stubbornly.
"""Sidney--wait a minute!"" Pola called and Sidney could do nothing but"
wait until Pola came up to them.
"""I thought you were going to stay in Chatham tonight."""
"""I should say _not_!"" Pola had enough breath to make her answer"
"expressive. ""I was never so bored in my life. Those Truxton girls are"
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that
"isn't possible. Oh, Lois, there is surely nothing worse than helpless"
"remorse!"""
The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked
"it. I failed him."""
"""Have you really failed him?"""
"""Lois, I don't know--I am beginning to believe not. But it is too"
late. I meant to clear away the rubbish--and build. But there is no
"time."""
"""You have done your best."""
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"
"and traded some bonds."""
"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the
"lot."""
"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"
little trading here this morning. Mind getting the bond desk at
Westminster Union on the line? Tell Nogami we're good for a hundred in
"Mino Industries debentures, the new issue. At par."""
"""Michael."" It was Eva's voice, suddenly alarmed."
"""What?"""
"""We've got company. They look like field reps."""
"""Good God."" Novosty strode to the door and looked out. A group of four"
"leather-jacketed Japanese were headed down the hallway, two disarmed"
MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.
"Turning back, he looked imploringly at Vance. ""What do we do?"""
"""Figure they came prepared."" He waved toward Eva. ""Better lose that"
.38. Put it on the table for now. Maybe we can still talk this thing

"considers me his friend."""
"""Sibyl was at your reception the other evening,"" I remarked suddenly."
"""She told me she met a man who was a stranger in Paris.  His name, I"
"think she said, was Wolf--Rodolphe Wolf.  Who is he?"""
"""He was introduced by de Wolkenstein, the Austrian Ambassador,"" she"
"replied quickly.  ""I did not know him."""
"""Have you never met him before?""  I asked, looking sharply into her"
eyes.
"""Once, I think, but I am not certain,"" she said, with a palpable effort"
to evade my question.
I smiled.
"""Come, madame,"" I said good-humouredly, ""you know Rodolphe Wolf quite as"
"well as I do.  When you last met, his name was not Wolf.  Is not that"
"so?"""
"""Well,"" she answered, ""now that you put it in that manner I may as well"
"admit that your suggestion is correct."""
"""And what is the object of his sudden visit to Paris?"""
"""I cannot make out,"" she replied in a more confidential tone.  ""As I"
"tell you, de Wolkenstein introduced him, but, as m'sieur knows, I am"
"very quick to detect a face that I have once seen, and I recognised him"
"in an instant."""
"I began speaking French, but when I paused for his verdict, he shrugged"
"his shoulders, saying:--"
"""Ah, _oui, oui!_ It may be better than my English."" But notwithstanding"
"his scant praise, we spoke the French language thereafter."
"The count bowed himself out and left me to decipher, if I could, the"
problem of M. l'Abbé du Boise. Presently I discovered the cue. The
"Abbé was George Hamilton, and for the moment my heart almost stopped"
"beating. If he should come to England on the French king's business,"
"which could be nothing more nor less than the Dunkirk affair, and"
"should be discovered, there would be a public entertainment on Tyburn"
"Hill, with George as the central figure."
"When I found a spare hour, I hastened to see Lilly and came upon the"
"good Doctor among the stars, as usual. There was a letter for me from"
Hamilton. It was short and in cipher:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""This is to tell you that M. l'Abbé du Boise will soon be in London. He"
will be the guest of M. Comte de Grammont.
"""You do not know him. Please call on him when he arrives. Tell the"
Duchess of Hearts that he will want to see her. Ask her to be ready to
"help him. He goes to buy Dunkirk for the French king, and his success"
will mean good fortune for me.
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
more.
"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.
*       *       *       *       *
"Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the"
"door and came back beside me. ""Well,"" he said, swinging to a bunk,"
"""that's sort of it."""
"""You're better off, Butt,"" I burst out. ""You shouldn't have a woman"
"like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget"
"she was trained to run an underwater city!"""
"""Wasn't worrying about that,"" he grinned. ""_I_ grew up in the fifteen"
"long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope."" He turned over on his"
"They shoved their one ""Dutchman"" forward, and after some interchange"
"of utter un-intelligibilities, listened to by every one with bated"
"breath, Hermann turned round."
"""I not versteh, captain.  I denk him ein French."""
"The Frenchman was joined by two or three more, and then by a dozen."
"""Why, they're all French,"" said the disgusted crowd.  ""What's"
"Frenchmen doin' on any island of ours?"""
"And until the sea went down, which it did sufficiently to allow them"
"to get ashore at about ten o'clock, they discussed the question as to"
whether the Crozets were English or not.  It was settled by old
Mackenzie.
"""All islands as don't belong to any one belongs to us,"" he said; ""it"
"was arranged so by Disraeli."""
"They got ashore with some risk, and were greeted by the Frenchman in"
the most amiable way.
"""Poor beggars!"" said the crew; ""it must be 'ard on a soft lot of"
things like them to be on a des'late hisland.  Ain't it a wonder
"Froggies ever goes to sea?  But does they belong 'ere, or was they"
"piled hup same's hus?"""
Hart found himself alongside a Frenchman with a long red Liberty cap
"on, and a big pair of ear-rings in his ears."
"""Goddam,"" said the Frenchman."
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
"""What?"" She was shakily rising, pulling her yukata around her."
"""All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha."""
"She came over and stood beside him. ""I don't believe this."""
"""Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?"""
"She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and bent down"
"to test the water. ""Feels wet."" She glanced back. ""So what the heck. I"
"could use it."""
"""I'm ready."" He kicked off his tabi and walked on out."
"She pulled off his _yukata_, then picked up one of the pails and began"
"filling it from a spigot on the wall. ""Okay, exalted male,"" she"
"laughed, ""I'm going to scrub you. That's how they do it, right?"" She"
stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.
"""They know how to live. Here, let me."" He picked up a second sponge and"
"began scrubbing her back in turn. ""How does it feel?"""
"""Maybe this is heaven."""
"""Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've got a"
"feeling the fun is just beginning."""
"He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as she gingerly"
climbed down into the wooden tub.
"""Michael, where do you think we are?"" She sighed as the steam enveloped"
"her. ""This has got to be Japan, but where?"""
the cotters to see how they were getting on.
"""So that's where he's gone?"" he said. ""Well, let him stay there, for all I"
"care!"""
The manufacturer cracked jokes to the very end. Of course he was a little
"depressed by the farewells, too, but he had to keep his family's courage"
"up. His wife stood holding one of his arms with both hands, and the"
children clung to his other arm.
"""I can't salute you,"" the manufacturer said to us, smiling. ""I'm not"
"allowed to say good-bye."""
"The children rejoiced at this and cried, ""No, he can't have his arm back;"
"Mummy, you hold him tight, too!"""
"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"
"""I don't borrow."""
"""Ingeborg!"" said he, pretending playfully to whimper."
"""What is it?"""
"""Nothing. Can't I say 'Ingeborg' to my own wife?"""
"""I'm not your own wife,"" she said, getting up."
"""Pish! We were man and wife last night. It says so in the visitors' book."""
"She was silent at this. Yes, last night they had been man and wife; that"
"was to save getting two rooms, and travel economically. But she had been"
very foolish to agree to it.
"""'Miss Torsen,' then?"" he whimpered."
"And to put an end to the game, she paid for both of them and took her"
knapsack on her back.
They walked again. At the next stop she paid for them both without
"discussion--for the evening meal, for bed and breakfast. It grew to be a"
habit. They walked on once more. They reached the end of the valley by the
"sea, and here she revolted again."

"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."

Something of the light of triumph came stealing back to the old
tear-stained face.
“And Julia?” he asked.
"“I’ve sent her out to get tickets for the theatre,” she said drily."
“They will want amusing badly to-night--and the tuning of the fiddles
"would always rouse my Netherby.... But you’d better go up and see him,"
Noll--you used to know the way.”
Noll made a pause to take breath at the top of the stairs (how he and
Betty had raced up those steps!). He pushed open the attic door.
"In the midst of the smudgy dusk that filled the room, his head in his"
"hands, elbows on knees, sat the dim figure of Netherby Gomme, sobbing"
pitifully.
"Noll shut the door softly, and went up to the bowed man:"
"“Good God, Netherby!” said he--“what’s this?”"
"He gripped his hand upon the other’s shoulder, affectionately."
Gomme signed him to a seat:
"“Sit down, Noll--I’ll be all right in a minute.” He blew his nose."
"“No--better still, light the gas. I must stop. Tears will not bring"
"back one’s dead, nor grief annul the things that are done. Light up! A"
man can only cry comfortably in the dark.”
"Noll struck a light, turned on the tap of the wrought-iron gas-jet; and"
The last sheet of notations was covered. Then John Dennis sat motionless
"for a minute, his frown and uncertainty returning. ""It's hard to project"
"the details,"" he said. ""All this detail. Difficult."""
He dropped the last sheet and got up and poured himself another Scotch.
"""They will make an army now,"" he said. The Scotch went down smoothly. He"
"went to the window and looked out. ""This planet is different. The sun"
"there is blue and the air is very thin. Their bodies are nothing, but"
their heads are very big. Now they will create an army and take this
"planet."""
Frank Corson was shaking his head slowly like a groggy fighter. Rhoda
"sat huddled on the sofa, her mind such a mixture of tumbling emotions"
that it seemed to be trying to tear itself out of her head. John Dennis
"came back and stood in the middle of the room. He swayed drunkenly. ""So"
many things I don't understand. I see people I know--or I should know.
"I--"" He turned his eyes--eyes no longer empty--on Rhoda."
"""I want to make love!"""
Frank Corson got up from his chair and hurled himself on Dennis.
Rhoda screamed.

Senator Crane sat at his desk. There were a pile of newspapers in front
of him. The first one carried a front page story with the headline:
SENATOR CRANE WARNS OF SPACE INVASION

"""So did you do it?"" Andrei Androv examined him, his ancient face ashen"

"He caught himself laughing out loud. Whatever else, his father was no"

"""You're right."""
"""Go back to the West Quadrant. Listen to a string quartet."" He opened"
"the port and waited for his father to step out. Then he followed,"
"closing it behind them. ""There's no reason for you to be involved."
"Heads are going to roll, but why should yours be one of them?"""
"Andrei Petrovich Androv moved lightly up the metal stair, the spring in"
his step belying his age. At the top he paused and turned back.
"""You're acting out of principle, aren't you, Yuri? For once in your"
"life."""
"""I guess you could say that."" He smiled, then moved on up the steps."
"""Someday, the Russian people will thank you."""
"""Someday. Though I may not live to see it."""
"""Want to give you a little tip, too. They want you upstairs. A"
"commendation. Not generally known, though. And you deserve it. You'll be"
"called up tomorrow."""
"""You never know the day or the hour."""
"The laugh came again. ""You're humor is priceless, old man."""
"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the

"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"
"you."""
"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"
"sprayed charm through the phone like perfume from an atomizer. ""But if"
"you quote me, I'll deny it."""
"""Oh, I wouldn't think of quoting you, old man,"" Taber replied in a"
kindly voice and put down the phone.
He sat back and closed his eyes. Three people dead. One person maimed.
Blood in the streets.
Good job well done.

"""Sit down. Will you have a cigarette?"""
"""No, thank you. I just wanted to ask you about a transfer."""

"Maynard went swiftly through a card file on his desk. ""You have--let's"

"“Mrs. Moulton must know of this,” remarked Kennedy. “Winters, you and"
Jameson bring Muller along. I am going up to the Deluxe.”
I must say that I was surprised at finding Mrs. Moulton there. Outside
"the suite Winters and I waited with the unresisting Muller, while"
Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he began, “something terrible has happened—”"
"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.
"“Where is Mr. Moulton?” he went on, changing his question."
"“Mr. Moulton is at his office,” she answered tremulously. “He"
"telephoned while I was out that he had to work to-night. Oh, Mr."
Kennedy—he knows—he knows. I know it. He has avoided me ever since I
missed the replica from-”
“Sh!” cautioned Craig. He had risen and gone to the door.
"“Winters,” he whispered, “I want you to go down to Lynn Moulton’s"
office. Meanwhile Jameson can take care of Muller. I am going over to
that place of Stein’s presently. Bring Moulton up there. You will wait
"here, Walter, for the present,” he nodded."
He returned to the room where I could hear her crying softly.
"""I think I _tried_ to fight."""
"""Of course, you did. The disgrace was mine. I acted like a child. I"
should have realized that something extraordinary had happened. But I
"nursed my miserable little ego like a three-year-old."""
"""How could you know? My cruelty to you--"""
"""Don't talk like that! I knew about the ninth android, and I met the"
tenth one in front of your apartment that second morning. I should have

"""It's all over now. It doesn't make any difference."""
"""No, it doesn't make any difference."""
"She looked at him in silence for several moments. ""You've changed,"
"Frank."""
"""Yes, I guess I have. I guess we all grow up eventually. We all face"
"reality and live with it."""
"""Frank--I think I'm going to cry."""
He could not turn his eyes in her direction. He looked straight ahead
"but his voice was soft. ""Go ahead, Rhoda. I understand."""
"They were silent for a time, then Rhoda began to cry quietly into her"
handkerchief. After a while even that sound was stilled.
He turned to look at her. She was standing beside the bed. He almost
"reached out and took her hand, but drew his own back at the last minute."

ACT I
The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"
"wall.  PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her head, with an"
expression of concern.
PAYNTER.  Where's she gone?
"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?
"BURNEY.  Oh!  Quiet, of course."

"Where ha' you been fidging abroad, since you your nee'le lost?"
"_Gammer._ Within the house, and at the door, sitting by this same"
post;
"Where I was looking a long hour, before these folks came here."
"But, wellaway! all was in vain; my nee'le is never the near."
"_Hodge._ Set me a candle, let me seek, and grope wherever it be."

"Captured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of"
taking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in
"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"
Captain Morgan in one of the prizes.

"me. Yes, madam, you may wince,' he continued bitterly, 'for you shall"
still be my wife; and when you are my wife we will talk of that.'
"'Never!' she said, with a brave face; but her heart beat wildly, and a"
mist rose before her eyes.
"He laughed. 'My legions are round me,' he said. 'Where are yours?'"
"'You are a gentleman,' she answered with an effort. 'You will let me"
go.'
'If I do not?'
'There are those who will know how to avenge me.'
"He laughed again. 'I do not know them, Countess,' he said"
"contemptuously. 'For Hesse Cassel, he has his hands full at Nuremberg,"
"and will be likely, when Wallenstein has done with him, to need help"
himself. The King of Sweden--the brightest morning ends soonest in
"rain--and he will end at Nuremberg. Bernhard of Weimar, Leuchtenstein,"
all the fanatics fall with him. Only the banner of the Free Companies
"stands and waves ever the wider. Be advised,' he continued grimly."
"'Bend, Countess, or I have the means to break you.'"
'Never!' she said.
"'So you say now,' he answered slowly. 'You will not say so in five"
"minutes. If you care nothing for yourself, have a care for your"
friends.'
"'You said I had none,' she retorted hoarsely."
Knee-deep in the water he tried to shout but he had no strength. A
"terrible faintness was creeping over him. His arms outstretched, he"
"stumbled forward toward the voices. Oh, he must _not_ yield to that"
overpowering sleepiness until he had made them know!
"""Help--help!"" he gasped, reeling toward the shadowy forms."
"""What the blazes--"" A man ran forward. Two others came at his heels."
"""Why, _it's Lav Green_!"" one of them cried."
"""The _Arabella_--adrift out there--Sidney's on it--oh--_help_! And then"
Lavender slipped into the strong arms that reached out to catch him.
"""Quick, the _Sally_! She's at Rockman's!"" Captain Davies ran toward"
"Rockman's wharf. Before Jed Starrow's men, concealed behind the shed"
"could guess their intention, three men had jumped into the big motor"
boat and had swung her free of the wharf.
"""What the hell--"" shouted an ugly voice after them, but the _Sally_"
only chugged out into the darkness of the bay.

Sidney lifted her face to the tiny streak of light that gleamed palely
in the east.
Then she shook Pola ever so slightly. Poor Pola had fallen into a sleep
"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""

Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.

THE POWER OF EVIL
"""You might call it a fight,"" Elizabeth said, ""but they never actually"
"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"
"face, locking him in. He laughed evilly and called after me, 'Why waste"
"time running away, Elizabeth? I'll come to get you, and you won't be"
"able to resist me now!'"""

"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No, it is not.  It has been destroyed."""
"""Why?""  I asked."
"""For some mysterious reason known to Yolande.""  Then, turning quickly"
"again to me, she placed her hand upon my arm in deep earnestness,"
"saying: ""Tell me, is your love for her absolutely and entirely dead--so"
"dead that you would not care to perform her a service?"""
Anderson's strange and startling story flashed through my mind.  I made
no reply.
"""Remember the affection you once bore her,"" she urged.  ""I am a woman,"
"m'sieur, and I presume to remind you of it."""
I needed no reminder.  The recollection of those sweet idyllic days was
still fresh as ever in my memory.  Ah! in those brief sunny hours I had
fondly believed that our love would last always.  It is ever the same.
Youth is ever foolish.
"""I should have loved her now,"" I answered at last, ""were it not for one"
"fact."""
"There was a mystery which had ended our love, and I saw now an"
"opportunity of clearing it up.  ""To what fact do you refer?"""
"""To the reason of our parting."""
"""The reason!"" echoed the Countess.  ""I have no idea whatever of the"
"reason.  What was it?"""
I held my breath.  Would it be just to tell her the truth?  I wondered.
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
"""Where does she work?"""
"""Down in Wall Street."""
"""Not much chance we're interested. This money has been turning up around"
"Times Square."""
"""The other's a man--quiet, no trouble, pays his rent right on the dot"
every week. John Dennis his name is and he doesn't look like no
"counterfeiter."""
"Taber took a forward step. ""What's his room number?"""
"""Six--on the second floor. But he isn't in now. He just went out."""
"""Okay. Maybe I'll be back. As I said, we don't suspect anybody. We're"
"just checking for sources."""
Taber turned toward the door. The woman vanished back into her own
quarters as Taber snapped the lock. He stood in the vestibule for a
"minute or two, studying some cards he took from his pocket, and when she"
"did not reappear, he opened the door, went back in, and climbed the"
stairs.
The door to number six was not locked. Taber went inside. The window was
small and gave on an areaway. He could see nothing until he turned on
"the light. Even then, he could see nothing of interest--the room was"
ordinary in every sense.
"But as Brent Taber checked it out, some unusual aspects became apparent."
"There were two pieces of luggage in the closet. One, an oversized"
"suitcase, stood on end."
on his face.
"The girls surged forward when they saw him, scattering the crew to one"
side. They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a
dying whale.
"""M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians built like that?"""
"""Men like that are worth the mileage!"""
"""_I want him!"" ""I want him!"" ""I want him!_"""
Sis had been let go. She grabbed my free hand and pulled me away. She
"was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles"
of fury popping in them.
"""The cheap extroverts! And they call themselves responsible women!"""
"I was angry, too. And I let her know, once we were in our cabin."
"""What about that promise, Sis? You said you wouldn't turn him in. You"
"_promised_!"""
She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get
"to Venus on foot. ""I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."""
"""My name is Ford and I don't understand."""
"""Your name is Ferdinand and stop trying to act forcefully like a girl."
"It doesn't become you. In just a few days, you'll forget all this and"
"be your simple, carefree self again. I really truly meant to keep my"
"word. From what you'd told me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a fundamentally"
decent chap despite his barbaric notions on equality between the

“And now you have found me.”
"She had turned, hastily, to leave the room. Kennedy blocked the door."
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he said firmly, “listen to me. What was the first"
question you asked me? ‘Can I trust you?’ And I told you you could.
This is no time for—for suicide.” He shot the word out bluntly. “All
may not be lost. I have sent for your husband. Muller is outside.”
“Muller?” she cried. “He made the replica.”
“Very well. I am going to clear this thing up. Come. You _must_.”
"It was all confused to me, the dash in a car to the little pawnbroker’s"
"on the first floor of a five-story tenement, the quick entry into the"
place by one of Muller’s keys.
Over the safe in back was a framework like that which had covered
"Schloss’ safe. Kennedy tore it away, regardless of the alarm which it"
must have sounded. In a moment he was down before it on his knees.
"“This is how Schloss’ safe was opened so quickly,” he muttered, working"
feverishly. “Here is some of their own medicine.”
He had placed the peculiar telephone-like transmitter close to the
combination lock and was turning the combination rapidly.
"Suddenly he rose, gave the bolts a twist, and the ponderous doors swung"
open.
"before these, or will you see me alone?'"
"'Your spy, that cat there,' my lady answered, carried away by her"
"temper, 'may go! The women will stay.'"
"Fraulein Max, singled out by that merciless finger, sprang forward,"
her face mottled with surprise and terror. For a second she hesitated.
"Then she rushed towards her friend, as if she would embrace her."
'Countess!' she cried. 'Rotha! Surely you are mad! You cannot think
that I would----'
"My lady turned, and in a flash struck her fiercely on the cheek with"
"her open hand. 'Liar!' she cried; 'go to your master, you whipped"
hound!'
"The Dutch woman recoiled with a cry of pain, and sobbing wildly went"
back to her place. The general laughed harshly.
"'You hold with me, sweetheart,' he said. 'Discipline before"
everything. But you have not my patience.'
"She looked at him--angry with him, angry with herself, her hand to her"
bosom--but she did not answer.
"'For you must allow,' he continued--his tone and his eyes still"
bantered her--'that I have been patient. I have been like a man
"athirst in the desert; but I have waited day after day, until now I"
"can wait no longer, sweetheart.'"
'So you tamper with my--with that woman!' she said scornfully.
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady
"Margaret’s son has gone on the stage.... Gerty, do you know who that"
"dark creature is? with the Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the"
"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"

"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.

Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"

The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.

camp.

pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your

black water.

"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."
"Mrs. Marchmont arrived, accompanied by an old man who evidently was her"
"""Less of your lip, now!"" snarled the old man. ""And _don't_ keep on"
"saying that. Just take it from me again, both of you, that you'd better"
"not be so slow again in telling me--"""
"""You didn't give me time,"" Mr. Jobling protested."
"Slyne opened the door. ""Come on,"" he urged. ""You've got to get your kit"
"packed, Jobling. We'll be leaving before very long now."""
"""Have you made up your mind to come with us, Dove?"""
"Captain Dove nodded, most emphatically. ""I'll send word to Brasse and Da"
"Costa at once,"" he remarked, ""and then I'll be ready to start whenever"
"you are."""
"He left the room after Mr. Jobling, and Slyne, in the doorway, looked"
"back at Sallie, the reassuring smile on his lips belied by his cold,"
calculating eyes.
"""And how about you, Sallie?"" he asked. ""Have you made up your mind? Are"
you satisfied--so far? Or--would you rather go back to the _Olive
Branch_?
"""If you would--I'll let you off your promise, even now! And don't forget"
"that this will be your last chance to recall it."""
"""You know I can't go back to the _Olive Branch_, Jasper,"" she answered"
"slowly. ""But--"""
"He did not give her time to say more. ""That's settled for good, then,"""
"he asserted. ""Your promise stands, and I know you'll keep it when the"

marriage of Arachne with a duke to report. And he told her of his
"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"
of tragedy. It was in the nature of a shock to him when Stella's maid
entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”
"“Of course,” said John. “Do you think it 's so damned easy?”"
"“You had better be quick, if you 're coming back to town with me. I'm"

One of the _kobun  _withdrew the Zenith. He placed it on the mahogany

"blank gray screen, unsure what he was supposed to do next."
"Vera knew. She reached for the switch on the side and clicked it on,"
then stood back and turned to Eva.

"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"give?"""
"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back
the bolts and bade the boys to come in.
"Headed by Rance, the men quickly filed in and deposited their lanterns"
"on the floor. It was evident that they had found the storm most severe,"
And Gyp thought: 'How wonderful of him not to have asked a single
question.'
"The cab stopped at the Bury Street door.  She took his hand, put it to"
"her cheek, and got out.  He said quietly:"
"""Do you want the dogs?"""
"""Yes--oh, yes!  He doesn't care for them."""
"""All right.  There'll be time to get you in some things for the night"
after I come back.  I shan't run any risks to-day.  Make Mrs. Markey give
"you tea."""
"Gyp watched the cab gather way again, saw him wave his hand; then, with a"
"deep sigh, half anxiety, half relief, she rang the bell."

"When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the"
"order: ""Quick as you can!""  One could think better going fast! A little"
red had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids
had a keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did
"when a fox was breaking cover.  Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could,"
he would stand by her in it as a matter of course.  But he was going to
"take no risks--make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary."
"He had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely"
determination and resource which makes many Englishmen of his class

"“Mebbe if you step in an’ wait he’ll be back soon,” suggested the"

"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.

"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"
the curtains.
"""But hadn't you better take the bed and let me sleep over here?"""
"""Not much!"""
"""You're sure you would be more comfortable by the fire--sure, now?"""
"""Yes, you bet!"""
Of London.
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at
"Charleston on November 8th, 1718, and found ""not guilty."""
"NONDRE, PEDRO."
"Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution"
it was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the
"scaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and"
had to be hanged a second time.
"NORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"Served under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman"
"was left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the"
"isthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon ""sent forth to sea two boats to"
"exercise piracy."" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish"
"merchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety"
"into the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a"
"valuable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the"
garrison was in sore need.
"NORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL."
"Born in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of"
"remarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great"
"notoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written"
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.
"""Rance is right. Where was he goin'?"" was the question with which he was"
beginning to smite him hard.
"""Don't laugh!"""
"""I'm not laughing,"" as indeed he was not."
"""O' course every girl kind o' looks ahead,"" went on the Girl in"
explanation.
"""Yes, I suppose,"" he observed seriously."
"""An' figgers about bein'--well, Oh, you know--about bein' settled. An'"
"when the right man comes, why, she knows 'im, you bet! Jest as we both"
"knowed each other standin' on the road to Monterey. I said that day,"
"he's good, he's gran' an' he can have me."""
"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""
At those clear words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide his
want to say something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven’t
"had time to make love to you in the ordinary way, but I really do love"
"you. Talk quick, please—those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of"
Union Pacific.”
"“Oh, what are you talking about?” exclaimed the young lady. She rose to"
"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."
"“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry"
"me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a"
minute when things had slackened up a bit. They’re calling me for the
"’phone now. Tell ’em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won’t you, Miss"
Leslie?”
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.
"“I know now,” she said, softly. “It’s this old business that has driven"
everything else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at
"first. Don’t you remember, Harvey? We were married last evening at 8"
o’clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.”
AFTER TWENTY YEARS
The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The
"impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few."
"Asiatic countries. We are said to be the successors of the Tartars, at"
one time the disturbers of the world's peace. Nothing of the kind.
Russia would be more fittingly the successor of the Tartars. The Tartar
races have been merged in the Russian Empire.
"'I am sure,' added Baron Suyematsu, in a final word, 'that Europe will"
"soon find its fears about the ""spectre of Japan"" are all ill-founded."
"England, I am glad to believe, never had those fears, and before long I"
hope to see her colonies in the same frame of mind. I hope the
Commonwealth Parliament will lead the way.'

XIII
THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"
astounded to attempt an answer to the questions hurled broadcast by the
"new-comers; then Marsh levelled a trembling finger at him and cried,"
hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"
"arrested."""
The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""
the better for it.
"83,672. He could not understand why men went to Japan and Canada instead"
of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.
"83,673. All the students coming to his side of the University, were, as"
"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"
students.
"83,674. (Mr. Gupta). He desired one service, because he thought it was"
"most degrading that certain men, although they were doing the same work,"
"should be classed in a Provincial Service, while others should be"
classed in an Imperial Service. The prospect of the members of the
"Provincial Service were not at all what they ought to be, and that was"
the reason why the best men were not attracted to it.
PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.
"""But the police?"" queried Boyd."
"""Oh, I squared them easy. It's you they want. Yes, sir, I _worked_."""
"Again he scanned their faces anxiously. ""I'm a scullery-maid."""
"""What?"""
"""That's what I said. I've rustled garbage-cans till the smell of food"
"gives me a cold sweat. I'm as hungry as a starving Cuban, and yet the"
"sight of a knife and fork turns my stomach."" He wheeled suddenly upon"
"Alton Clyde, whose burst of shrill laughter offended him. ""Don't cry."
"Your sympathy unmans me."""
"""Tell us about it,"" urged Cherry."
"""What's the use?"" he demanded, with a glare at Clyde. ""That bone-head"
"wouldn't understand."""
"""Go ahead,"" Boyd seconded, with twitching lips. ""You look as if you had"
"worked, and worked hard."""
"""Hard? I'm the only man in the world who knows what hard work is!"""
"""Start at the beginning--when you were arrested."""
"""Well, I didn't care nothing about the sneeze,"" he took up the tale,"
"""for I figure it out that they can't slough me without clearing you, so"
"I never take no sleeping-powders, and, sure enough, about third"

"drink and get Jerry to your fade--"""
"should be hastily sent away by his friends, what her father had"
"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"
impair the perfect sweetness of memory wherein she held her mother.
"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"
"mind, dear, you mustn't mind. Oh, you didn't think it would make any"
"difference to me, dear, did you? What do I care? Mrs. Puttock may care,"
the grey sky.
"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to

THE HARBOR MASTER

The scene of the story is Newfoundland. The story deals with the love
"of Black Dennis Nolan, a young giant and self-appointed skipper of the"
"little fishing hamlet of Chance Along, for Flora Lockhart, a beautiful"
"professional singer, who is rescued by Dennis from a wreck on the"
"treacherous coast of Newfoundland, when on her way from England to the"
"United States. The story is a strong one all through, with a mystery"
"that grips, plenty of excitement and action, and the author presents"
life in the open in all its strength and vigor. Mr. Roberts is one of
the younger writers whom the critics have been watching with interest.
"In ""The Harbor Master"" he has surely arrived."
ever-increasing recklessness--began presently to possess us. Once or
"twice I had to check the foremost, or they would have outrun the rear;"
"and this kind of race brought us gradually into such a state of alarm,"
"that by-and-by, when the line came to a sudden stop on the brow of a"
"gentle descent, I could hardly restrain my impatience."
'What is it?' I asked eagerly. 'Why are we stopping?' Surely the road
is good enough here.'
"No one answered, but it was significant that on the instant one of the"
women began to cry.
'Stop that folly!' I said. 'What is in front there? Cannot some one
speak?'
"'The Waldgrave thinks that he hears horsemen before us,' Fraulein Max"
answered.
In another moment the Waldgrave's figure loomed out of the darkness.
"'Martin,' he said--I noticed that his voice shook--'go forward. They"
"are in front. Man alive, be quick!' he continued fiercely. 'Do you"
want to have them into us?'
"I left my girl's rein, and pushing past the women and Fraulein, joined"
"Steve, who was standing by my lady's rein. 'What is it?' I said."
"'Nothing, I think,' he answered in an uncertain tone."
"I stood a moment listening, but I too could hear nothing. I began to"
argue with him. 'Who heard it?' I asked impatiently.
"'The Waldgrave,' he answered."
"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS."
Sailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba
his teeth.
"""Are you going with us?"" Boyd inquired."
"""Sure."""
"""See here. Is life one long succession of surprise parties with you?"""
"""Why, I've figgered on this right along."""
"""But the ship is jammed now. There is no room."""
"""Oh, I fixed that up long ago. I am going to bunk with the steward."""
"""Well, why in the world didn't you let us know you were coming?"""
"""Say, don't kid yourself. You knew I couldn't stay behind."" Fraser blew"
"a cloud of smoke airily. ""I never start anything I can't finish, I keep"
"telling you, and I'm going to put this deal through, now that I've got"
"it started."" With a half-embarrassed laugh and a complete change of"
"manner, he laid his hand upon Boyd's shoulder, saying: ""Pal, I ain't"
"much good to myself or anybody else, but I like you and I want to stick"
"around. Maybe I'll come in useful yet--you can't tell."""
"Emerson had never glimpsed this side of the man's nature, and it rather"
surprised him.
"""Of course you can come along, old man,"" he responded, heartily. ""We're"
"glad to have you."""
To one who has never witnessed the spring sailing of a Northern
"cannery-tender, the event is well worth seeing; it is one of the"
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
"""Butt's trying to decide whether he wants him fried or scrambled,"" the"
"Computer's Mate said, pulling her back. ""Hey, purse, remember when the"
whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue
"with Colonel Leclerc?"""
"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"
"Treaty,"" the Captain was saying very loudly, ""I arrest you for"
violation of Articles Sixteen to Twenty-one inclusive of the Space
"Transport Code, and order your person and belongings impounded for"
the duration of this voyage as set forth in Sections Forty-one and
"Forty-five--"""

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"
"the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look"
"Now they found Mart at home. Sidney put her head in the door, made"
"certain that gran'ma was not in hearing, and cried ""Hook!"""
Mart had only to look once at Sidney's face to know that something had
happened. Sidney dragged her out to the Lane and there she and
"Lavender, in words as quick as pistol shots, told the story."
"""Meet us down on the beach near Milligan's at eight o'clock,"" Lav"
"whispered, as they parted."
CHAPTER XIX
THE GLEAM
Exactly at the appointed hour Sidney met Lavender on the beach. She was
breathless and a little worried for it had been neither easy nor to her
liking to deceive Aunt Achsa. Aunt Achsa had declared that a storm was
"""comin'"" for she could smell it in the air and Tillie Higgins had seen"

thought as she hurried to the rendezvous.
"""My lord,"" she said, kneeling at his feet, ""God save and comfort"
"you!""--"
The man's brow was twisted into furrows. His right hand clasped his
"left wrist. He looked over the woman's head into the woods, and"
breathed fast through clenched teeth.
"""Speak!"" he said."
"""My lord, the woman lives!"""
"""I can bear the truth!"""
The anchoress made the sign of the cross.
"""She came to us here in the valley, my lord, tall and white as a lily,"
"her hair loose upon her neck. Her feet were bare and bleeding, her"
"soles rent with thorns. And as she came, she sang wild snatches of a"
"song, such as tells of love, and of Proserpina, Goddess of Shades. We"
"took her, my lord, gave her meat and drink, bathed her torn feet, and"
"gave her raiment. She abode with us, ever gentle and lovely, yet"
"speaking like one who had suffered, even to the death. And yet,--even"
"as we slept, she stole away from us last night, and now is gone!""--"
The woman had never so much as raised her eyes to the man's face. Her
"hands held her crucifix, and she was ashen pale, even as new-hewn"
stone.
"""And is this all?"""
The man's voice trembled in his throat. His face was terrible to
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"

England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"

"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.

"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"

telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.

"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""

"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."

"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."
"SWITZER, JOSEPH."
Of Boston in New England.
"Tried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be ""not guilty."""
"Brand laughed. ""Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward"
"a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old"
"boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately."""

"Heiroy were lost!"""
"""And Journeyman,"" added Brand. ""He's the latest victim of whatever's"
"in the hell-hole."""
"Dex whistled. ""Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that"
whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine
"man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all"
"about?"""
"""Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you"
"all ready?"""
"""All ready,"" said Dex."
"""So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best"
"cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner"
"somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread"
"we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight."""
They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great
"space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a"
conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the
"long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while"
"right in suspecting Eilert, for I heard him going upstairs, and when I"
"came in, he was turning out the bag and going through the clothes."
"""What are you doing?"" I said."
At first he tried to brazen it out.
"""Never you mind,"" he replied. But my knowing something about him was so"
"much to my advantage that he soon drew in his horns. How I wronged him, he"
"complained, and exploited him:"
"""You haven't bought these clothes,"" he said. ""I could have got more for"
"them if I'd sold them."" He had been paid, but he still wanted more, like"
"the stomach, which goes on digesting after death. That was Eilert. Yet he"
"was not too bad; he had never been any better, and he certainly had grown"
no worse with his new livelihood.
May no one ever grow worse with a new livelihood!
So I moved the knapsack and the clothes into my own room in order to take
better care of them. It was a slow job to tidy everything up for the
"second time, but it had to be done. Later that evening I would resume my"
"journey, taking the knapsack with me. I had done with the place, and the"
nights were moonlit again.
Enough of these clothes!

"""Do you remember Pancorbo?"" said Ramon Garcia."
"Rollo could not hear the answer, but he caught the outlaw's next"
question.
"""And have you forgotten El Sarria, who, having a certain Miguelete under"
"the point of his knife, let him go for his sweetheart's sake, because"
"she was waiting for him down in the valley?"""
"The sentry's reply was again inaudible, but Rollo was fully awake now."
"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"
"companions. We are no traitors, but good Carlists to a man. Our papers"
"are----"""
"Here the words were spoken so low that Rollo could not hear more, but"
the next moment he was nudged by Ramon on the leg.
"""Write a note to Concha Cabezos, telling her to bring the papers here at"
"once if she would save our lives. You are sure she is faithful?"""
"""I am sure!"" said Rollo, who really had no reason for his confidence"
except the expression in her eyes.
"He had no paper, but catching the sentry's eye, he nodded across to"
where Etienne was still diligently rolling cigarettes.
"""Alcoy?"" he whispered."
"The sentry shouldered his piece and took a turn or two across the floor,"
"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"
"be the next one?'"" she returned, as she carefully laid the roses in her"
bureau drawer.
"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""
"""I'd hate to stake my pile on that,"" observed the Girl, drily. She blew"
up each glove as it came off and likewise carefully laid them away in
the bureau drawer.
"By this time Wowkle's soft tread had ceased, her duties for the night"
"were over, and she stood at the table waiting to be dismissed."
"""Wowkle, git to your wigwam!"" suddenly ordered her mistress, watching"
her until she disappeared into the cupboard; but she did not see the
Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.
"""Oh, you're sending her away! Must I go, too?"" asked Johnson, dismally."
"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she
busied herself there for a few minutes longer.

the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.

"addressing him without any pretensions, as if he were his own brother,"
"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"
"being only a soldier.  Looking at him, he grew fonder and fonder of"
"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred
"roubles and signed the paper, he threw the pen down on the table and"

3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

She fumbled with his jacket and pulled it off while he knelt there in

"The ring of the doorbell was like thunder in the room. Dennis tensed,"
"his eyes widened, and he got to his feet and stood swaying. Looking up"
"at him, Rhoda saw a trapped animal, but the excitement was still there"
and she wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and protect him from
the world.
But he had forgotten her. A cunning sneer took the place of the
slavering animal look and he ran to the kitchen to reappear moments
later with a butcher knife in his hand.

"""Then again, what is a wife?"" philosophises the baker, Mokei Anisimoff."

The conference therefore resolved itself into a trio of
"consultants--Rollo because he was the leader, Sergeant Cardono because"
"he knew the country, and Concha--because she was Concha!"
They were within an hour or two's rapid march of La Granja over a pass
in the Guadarrama. The sergeant volunteered to lead them down into the

their way to Segovia.

"The three rode in silence, Francesco and the duke together, looking"
mutely into each other's face. Francesco's head was bowed to his
breast. The reins lay loose on his horse's neck.
A gray cell of roughly hewn stone showed amidst the green boughs
beyond the water. At its door stood a woman in a black mantle. A cross
hung from her neck and a white kerchief bound her hair. She stood
"motionless, half in the shadow, watching the horsemen as they rode"
down to the rippling fords.
"Autumn had touched the sanctuary garden, and Francesco's eyes beheld"
"ruin as he climbed the slope. The woman had come from the cell, and"
now stood at the wicket-gate with her hands folded as if in prayer.
The horseman took Francesco's bridle. The latter went on foot alone to
speak with the anchoress.

on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."

Lois put down her knife.

"not notice that you have gone."""
"Beatrice nodded, and letting the heavy head sink back among the"

Beatrice held out her white hand and studied it thoughtfully.

felt interest enough in the fate of his late henchman to drop in at the

no one objected to his walking in and making for the door of the

about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"

"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"

Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.
"Frances was the last girl in the world, save, perhaps Sarah, who I should"
"have supposed capable of languishing and dying of love, but the former"
"she did before my eyes, and the latter I almost began to fear if news did"
not reach us soon from George.
"Betty came up to see Frances nearly every day, and the kissing and"
embracing that ensued disgusted Sarah.
"""Now, if Frances were a man, I could understand it,"" said Sarah. ""The"
"little barmaid must be tempting to a man, being pretty and--"""
"""Beautiful, Sarah!"" I interrupted."
"""Yes, beautiful, if you will."""
"""Her eyes--"" I began, again interrupting Sarah."
"""Oh, yes!"" cried Sarah, impatiently. ""Her eyes are fine enough, but their"
"expression comes from their color, their size, and their preposterously"
long eyelashes. Black long lashes often give a radiance to the eyes which
"passes for expressiveness, and I doubt not--"""
"""Nonsense, Sarah!"" I cried, half angrily. ""Bettina's eyes are expressive"
"in themselves. As you say, their soft dark brown is the perfection of"
"color, and they certainly are large. But aside from all that, their"
"expression is--"""
"""There is no intellect in them!"" cried Sarah."
"""There is tenderness, gentleness, love, and truth in them,"" I answered,"
with as careless an air as I could assume.
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
right under the window of his sitting-room. An Indian voice greeted
"him, ""Don' shoot; me killi him."""
"""Who in h---- are you?"" swore Searles, at a present."
"""Don' shoot, me Ahhæta--all same Sharp-Nose--don' shoot--me killi him."""
"""Killi who? Who have you killed? Talk up quick!"""
"""Me killi him. You come--you see."""
By this time the crowd drew in with questions and eager to help. A
"sergeant arrived with a lantern, and the guard laid rude hands on the"
"Crow scout, Sharp-Nose, who was well known. He was standing over the"
"prostrate figure, and continued to reiterate, ""Me killi him."""
"The lantern quickly disclosed the man on the ground to be John Ermine,"
"late scout and fugitive from justice, shot through the heart and dead,"
with his blanket and rifle on the ground beside him. As he looked
"through the window, he had been stalked and killed by the fool whom he"
"would not allow to shake hands with Katherine Searles, and a few moments"
"later, when Sharp-Nose was brought into her presence, between two"
"soldiers, she recognized him when he said, ""Mabeso, now you shake"
"hands."""
"""Yes, I will shake hands with you, Sharp-Nose,"" and half to herself, as"
"she eyed her malevolent friend, she muttered, ""and he kept you to"
"remember me by."""
"""I can say no more,"" Monsieur added. ""Accept my thanks and gratitude for"
"the help you have given me. And now--_bon soir_."""
"He bowed, backing himself toward the stairs as though leaving a royal"
"presence, doing it so easily, so naturally, that we did not even smile."
When he had quite disappeared we turned and faced each other.
"""What do you think now?"" I asked."
"""I think he's a treasure,"" Tommy cried. His face had lighted with a new"
"excitement. ""If we want any fun on this trip, don't let him get out of"
"our sight! Stick to him! I won't deny he has a screw loose, but----"""
"""That makes it all the better,"" I laughed, adding: ""Looks like the"
"Mater's toast might come true, after all, doesn't it!""--for I had"
described our New Year's Eve to Tommy.
"""Sonny, I've a hunch we won't even have to tiptoe over the hill to find"
"adventures with him around! He's their regular hanging-out place!"""
"Gates came up, and seemed vastly amused when we told him of our hopes."
"""He doesn't look like much of an adventurer, sir, but he's certainly a"
"change from the great run of people I've met. Still, I carn't see how"
"we're going to keep him against his will!"""
"""Neither can I, Tommy."""
"""Use a little persuasion."""
"""But suppose he won't persuade?"""
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little
kindness.
"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was
"forgotten. A maid, Stella's own maid, came in with a message. Miss"
"Stella's compliments, and were Mr. Risca and Mr. Herold having a good"
"supper? She herself was about to drink her egg beaten up in sherry, and"
would be glad if the gentlemen would take a glass of wine with her.
"The young men, accordingly, raised their glasses toward the ceiling and"
"drank to Stella, in the presence of the maid, and gave her appropriate"
messages to take back to her mistress.

Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.

"""WHAT THE NIGHT HELD"""
"mine must be in the 'ands of them mutilatin' French.  Simcox, you'll"
"'ave to go to 'em again and open n'gotiashuns!"""
"""No, sir,"" said Simcox, ""if you'll excuse me, I'll do nothin' of the"
"sort.  I've had my fill up of bein' ambassador."""
"""This is mut'ny,"" said the skipper; ""but under the painful national"
"circumstances I shan't do nothin' but order you to your cabin, where"
"you'll consider yourself in custody."""
"Simcox looked greatly relieved, and went without delay."
"""Mr. Lampert, you'll be hambassador,"" said the old man, after a drink"
of brandy.
The mate looked the skipper up and down.
"""I'll see you further first,"" he cried.  ""'Twas you that started the"
"row and the trouble, and you can get out of it as you like."""
"""This is rank mut'ny,"" said the skipper, ""and you could be 'ung for"
refusin' duty.  But under the painful nash'nal circumstances you can
retire to your cabin and be your own bloomin' policeman till peace is
"restored, when I'll try you and sentence you, you run and scuttle"
"swine you."""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said the mate contemptuously."
"""Now, men,"" said the skipper thickly, ""what I wants is 'earty"
"support.  Who'll volunteer for to be hambassador?"""
The crew looked at each other and shook their heads.  They scuffled
days were over. Michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start
building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break
loose.
Wednesday 10:23 A.M.
"""_Polovena decyat_?"" She examined him with her dark eyes."
"""_Da_."" Novosty nodded. ""They will be here at ten-thirty. That is the"
"schedule."""
"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier
"this morning, nobody knew where the money would be taken, not even the"
"Japanese banker Nogami. Still, the instruments were negotiable, leaving"
the possibility of trouble if the timing went sour.
of the Rogans caught her by the wrists and dragged her forward.
"""They have come to question you,"" Greca lamented to Brand. ""And they"
"want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!"""
Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.
"""You are powerless to struggle,"" he said. ""Do as they ask. You cannot"
"help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't"
"learn anything from us."""
"The tall Rogan teetered up to the prisoners on his gangling legs, and"
"stared icily at them. Crouched beside him, her lovely body all one"
mute appeal to the Earthmen to forgive her for the part she was forced
"to play, was Greca."
At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to
"Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen."
"""He says,"" exclaimed Greca telepathically, ""to inform you first that"
"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"
"globe must do as he commands."""
Brand nodded to show he understood the message.
"""He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to"
"answer truthfully if you value your lives:"""

"they all the same as you?"""

wings.
"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
"""Why, you owe me twenty."""
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
"""Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's haggle about such a trifle."
What's it matter if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the whole
"bloomin' watch for you?"""
"""Go to hell,"" said Lampert sulkily."
And Simcox went below.
"""To be a sailor is to be a natural born fool,"" said Lampert,"
"addressing the bitter and unkindly elements at large, ""and to be on"
"board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd, from the old man down"
"to the cook, is very trying.  It's very trying."""
"The wind took off a little later, but the weather was still thickish."
"""It's like lookin' through a haystack,"" grunted Lampert, ""but there,"
bar an island or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.  And if
"the skipper will crack on, and it a week since we saw the sun, it's"
"the owners' look out, not mine."""
"He spoke with a certain bitterness, as though he would really enjoy"
"being wrecked, in the trust that the _Potluck_ was not insured, and"
"that old Jones would get his certificate cancelled, or at least"
suspended.
"""'Twould give the old ass time to study foreign politics,"" sneered"
"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
no wish but to spend some pleasant hours with the Torsen type.
He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"to tea and was very----'  I can't quite make this word out."""
"""Let _me_ look,"" said the King, his rubicund face becoming yet more"
"rubicund.  ""It looks like 'charming,'"" he said casually."
"""Fancy!"" said Belvane.  ""Fancy my writing that!  I put down just what"
"comes into my head at the time, you know.""  She made a gesture with"
her hand indicative of some one who puts down just what comes into her
"head at the time, and returned to her diary.  ""'Remained to tea, and"
"was very charming.  Mused afterwards on the mutability of life!'"" She"
"looked up at him with wide-open eyes.  ""I often muse when I'm alone,"""
she said.
The King still hovered over the diary.
"""Have you any more entries like--like that last one?  May I look?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty!  I'm afraid it's _quite_ private.""  She closed the"
book quickly.
"""I just thought I saw some poetry,"" said the King."
"""Just a little ode to a favourite linnet.  It wouldn't interest your"
"Majesty."""
"""I adore poetry,"" said the King, who had himself written a rhymed"
"couplet which could be said either forwards or backwards, and in the"
latter position was useful for removing enchantments.  According to
"the eminent historian, Roger Scurvilegs, it had some vogue in Euralia"
and went like this:
"""_Bo, boll, bill, bole._"
clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....

"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
"My lady came swiftly to me, and it grieved me to see the pain and woe"
in her face.
'Is he mad?' she muttered.
I shook my head.
'Do you think he has really seen him?' she whispered. We both stood
with our eyes on him.
"'I fear so, my lady,' I said with reluctance."
"'But it would cost _him_ his life,' she muttered eagerly, 'if he were"
found here!'
"'He is a bold man,' I answered."
"'Ah! so was he--once,' she replied in a peculiar tone, and she pointed"
stealthily to the unconscious man in the window. 'A month ago he would
have taken him by the throat anywhere. What has come to him?'
"'God knows,' I answered reverently. 'Grant only he may do us no harm!'"
"He turned round at that, humming gaily, and went out, seeming almost"
unconscious of our presence; and I made as light of the matter to my
"lady as I could. But Tzerclas in the city, the Waldgrave mad, or at"
"any rate not sane, and last, but not least, the strange light in which"
"the latter chose to regard the former, were circumstances I could not"
easily digest. They filled me with uneasy fears and surmises. I began
"to perambulate the crowd, seeking furtively for a face; and was"
"entirely determined what I would do if I found it. The town was full,"
to Test Pilot Fayburn. A space egg had smashed through the cockpit
Plexi-glass and then pierced his pressurized suit.
"Blood on the pilot's seat indicated that he had been injured, but there"
was no wound. The loss of pressure in the cockpit and in his suit should
"have killed him instantly--yet here he was, alive and unharmed, but"
definitely a changed man.
"Always a mild, considerate person he had, in a matter of minutes, become"
a madman. What had brought about the change? Was he still human or was
he now OUT OF THIS WORLD?
Only time would tell as he daringly laid siege to an important air base
and began using his frightening power to force men and women to serve
his evil purpose.

"seemed to come surging over him like a flood, leaving him speechless,"
motionless.
"She had risen, and now held out her hand."

*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
"While I was reading the poems to her, the actor returned."
"""I couldn't find any galoshes there,"" he said."
"""No?"" she replied absently."
"""No, I really looked everywhere, but...."""
She got up and left the room.
"He looked after her in some surprise, and sat still for a moment. Then it"
occurred to him.
"""I believe her galoshes are in the passage outside her door,"" he said, and"
hurried after her.
"I sat back, thinking it over. There had been a sweetness in her face as"
"she said, ""Yes, you're very silent."" Had she seen through me and my"
pretext for reading to her? Of course she had. She was no fool. I was the
"fool, nobody else. I should have driven a sportsman to despair. Some"
"practice the sport of making conquests and the sport of making love,"
because they find it so agreeable; I have never practiced sport of any
kind. I have loved and raged and suffered and stormed according to my
nature--that is all; I am an old-fashioned man. And here I sit in the
"shadow of evening, the shadow of the half-century. Let me have done!"
The actor returned to the living room confused and dejected. She had
turned him out; she had wept.
"I was not surprised, for it was the mode of expression of her type."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"“Ah, it’s a pity. You had such an exquisite little voice. I regretted"
it after we parted. Two or three times it nearly brought me back to
you--_foi d’artiste!_”
"“I think I must go,” said Yvonne after a little. “I am leaving Ostend"
to-morrow and I shall not see you again. You don’t think I am treating
"you unkindly, Amédée?”"
He laughed in his bantering way and lit a cigarette.
"“On the contrary, _cher ange_. It is very good of you to talk to a poor"
"ghost. And you look so pathetic, like a poor little saint with its harp"
out of tune.”
"She rose, anxious to leave him and escape into solitude, where she could"
"think. She still trembled with agitation. In the little cool park, on"
"the other side of the square below, she could be by herself. She dreaded"
meeting the Canon yet awhile.
"“Do give up that vile absinthe,” she said, as a parting softness."
“It is the only consoler that remains to me--sad widower.”
"“Well, good-bye, Amédée.”"
"“Ah--not yet. Since you are the wife of somebody else, I am dying to"
make love to you.”
"He held her by the wrist, laughing at her. But at that moment Yvonne"
"caught sight of the Canon and Mrs. Winstanley, entering upon the"
terrace. She wrenched her arm away.
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
and then tell me how much probable space volume that so-called response
"represents."""
"The tech thought a minute. ""We've never run this gear anywhere"
"but at Radiation, right at Mojave labs, on Earth. Our spacial"
"coordinates--well, I'm afraid we--"" His voice trailed away unhappily."
Wilson picked up the interphone and barked a call.
"""Weston? Look, Hugh, can you get over here quick with a couple of your"
top astrogators? We've got a bunch of longhairs with a fancy infrawave
"detector and ranger, but the damned coordinates are set axially with"
"the ship."""
He listened to Hugh Weston's reply.
"""Yeah,"" he said then. ""We know where the target is with respect to the"
"ship, but we don't know the spacial attitude of the ship with respect"
"to the galactic check points. Right over? Good."""

"As Wilson hung up the dome flickered, then went into a regular"
_flash-flash-flash_ until something else came unglued and the dome
"went blank. There was shouting and rather heart-felt cussing, and some"
running around again before the dome light came back.
A tech--not the one that had come up before--moved into place alongside
the commodore.
"""Mr. Wilson, sir,"" he said, ""I wonder if--er--That is, sir--er--"""
"""Too lively to be talked about,"" he said. ""I doubt if the regiment"
"isn't going to add itself to the general disaster."""
"""Oh, rot!"" was the young officer's forgetful lapse into disrespect."
"""The regiment will do for the beggars all right. They didn't expect us"
"so soon, I fancy. Just listen! I believe I've frightened them away"
"already. There isn't a sound."""
"Colonel Carmichael lifted his head. True enough, no living thing"
"seemed to move. A profound hush hung in the air, broken only by Mrs."
Cary's pitiful meanings.
"""Oh, Beatrice, Beatrice, where are you?"""
Geoffries turned his stained face to the Colonel's.
"""Beatrice! That's Miss Cary, isn't it? Anything happened to her?"""
Colonel Carmichael shrugged his shoulders with the impatience of a man
whose nerves are overstrained by anxiety.
"""I don't know--we've lost her,"" he said. ""We must do something at"
"once. Heaven alone knows what has happened."""
No one indeed knew what had happened--not even the lonely man who
"waited, revolver in hand, for the final encounter on whose issue hung"
the fortunes of them all.
"Only one knew, and that was Beatrice herself as she stood before the"
"shattered doorway of the Colonel's drawing-room, amidst the debris of"
"wrecked, shot-riddled furniture, face to face with Nehal Singh."
talk such damned bad French.”
Rippley went and touched him on the shoulder:
"“Blotte, old boy; you’re very queer to-night,” he said. “You make me"
feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.”
"Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned to them all:"
“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
tries to draw her with him; but she resists.
Then he grows angry.
"""What the devil did you send for me for?"" he asks roughly."
And she begins to weep and says:
"""So that's all you've come for! Oh, oh! But I'm not like that at all. Why"
"can't you leave me alone? I'm not hurting you."""
Am I one who understands women? Self-deception. Vain boasting. I made my
presence known then because her weeping sounded so wretched; I moved a
chair and cleared my throat.
"The sound caught his attention at once, and he hushed her, trying to"
listen; but she said:
"""No, it was nothing...."""
But she knew very well this was not true; she knew what the sound was. It
was not the first time Miss Torsen used this trick with me; she had often
"pretended that she thought I was not within hearing, and then created some"
such delicate situation. Each time I had promised myself not to intervene;
but she had not wept before; now she wept.
"Why did she use these wiles? To clear herself in my eyes--mine, the eyes"
"of a settled man--to make me believe how good she was, how well-behaved!"
"But, dear child, I knew that before; I could see it from your hands! You"
"are so unnatural that in your seven and twentieth year, you walk"
"unmarried, barren and unopen!"

The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into
"solitude in the woods, alone with the good darkness round me. This is the"
last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"
"others and can endure only one's own, but because of their quality of"
"loftiness and religion. Strange how all things pass distantly, yet all is"
near; we sit in an omnipresence. It must be God. It must be ourselves as a
part of all things.
"What would my heart, where would I stray?"
Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.
"“DEAR MADELAINE,"
I am called home.
"I leave my rooms and all in them to your care, knowing that they will"
"be in good hands. I leave you also all the money I can spare, to keep"
you in decency and comfort until I return.
"I shall send, early in the day, for the large leather bag which you"
will find labelled and ready by the door.
NOLL.”
And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:
"“DEAR BABETTE,"
I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last
"night I found Madelaine at _The Golden Sun_. She was without home,"
"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"
no honest woman can live; she was without a bed. But her blood is
dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"
alone. She will babble all her news to you--it will be better for her
than babbling it to me.
Tell Horace not to go back to the haunts of his youth. The wine is
"If you reply that men and beasts are different, they will answer that in"
this point they do not recognise the difference. 'Poor beast! let him
live out his little life.' And they will give him grass and water till
he dies.
"This is the exception that I meant, but now, after I have written it, I"
am not so sure. Is it an exception?
CHAPTER XXI
ALL LIFE IS ONE
"'I heard a voice that cried,"
"""Balder the Beautiful"
"Is dead, is dead,"""
And through the misty air
Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"forthcoming he would cut the throats of all his prisoners, many of them"
"the leading merchants of the town. While waiting for the Governor's reply,"
Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."
"RICHARDSON, NICHOLAS."
"One of Captain Quelch's crew. Taken out of the brigantine _Charles_, and"
tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.
"RIDGE, JOHN."
Of London.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find

"""You mean that you have forsaken Edith and returned to her?"" he"
"observed, raising his brows slightly in surprise."
"""No; don't put it in that way,"" I implored.  ""I have not yet forsaken"
"Edith."""
"He smiled, just a trifle superciliously, I thought."
"""And the Countess is also in possession of this mysterious secret--eh?"""
"""Of that I am not at all certain,"" I replied."
He sniffed in distinct suspicion that what I had told him was not the
"truth.  At the same instant, however, the Countess entered and demanded"
to know the condition of her child.
"""She is much better, madame,"" he answered.  ""Perfect quiet is, however,"
"necessary, and constant observation of the temperature.  To-morrow, or"
"the day after, you may, I think, see her."""
"""Not till then!"" she cried.  ""I cannot wait so long."""
"""But it is necessary.  Your daughter's life hangs upon a single thread."""
"She was silenced, for she saw that argument was useless."
A few minutes later Jean entered with a message from Trepard asking Dick
"and myself to consult with him.  We therefore left the Countess again,"
and passed along the corridor to the room in which my love of long ago

"One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled"
"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"

The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"

She appeared to consider a moment.

never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"

"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep

"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""

"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.

"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"

"On the seventh day, the trees drew back before Francesco where the"
shimmering waters of the Nera streaked the meads. Peace dwelled there
"and calm eternal, as of the Spirit that heals the throes of men. Rare"
and golden lay the dawn-light on the valleys. The songs of the birds
came glad and multitudinous as in the burgeoning dawn of a glorious
day.
Francesco had halted under a great oak. His head was bare in the
"sun-steeped shadows, his face was the face of one weary with long"
watching under the voiceless stars. Great dread possessed him. He
dared not question his own soul.
"A horn sounded in the woods, wild, clamorous and exultant. It was as"
"the voice of a prophet, clearing the despair of a godless world. Even"
"the trees stood listening. Far below, in the green shadows of the"
"valley, a horseman spurred his steed."
"Francesco's eyes were upon him. Yet he dared not hope, gripped by a"
great fear.
"""I am even as a child,"" he said."
The duke's lips quivered.
"""The dawn breaks,--the night is past. Tidings come to us. Let us ride"
"out!"""
Francesco seemed lost in thought. He bowed his head and looked long
into the valley.
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.

At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
"hand to Craig, she added, “Mr. Kennedy, if there is anything I can do"
"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"
"I nodded ‘That will do’ to the twain, and dismissed them; and, they"
"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.
"I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention as I"
rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.

searchlights of the forts that guard the Straits. They saw him stop
"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""
"With an exclamation of impatience, the commanding officer stepped to"
"the telegraph, but Emerson forestalled him."
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

ERASMUS'S MIND
Thursday 2:34 P.M.
Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
"It was a grief to Dick to part from his master; but he saw the need, and"
he loved the horse only second to Grey himself.
"""I will do your behest, master.  Nay, I want no money; I have plenty for"
all my needs.  I too have made some modest wealth here in this great
"city. Only tell me where I may find you, and I will be gone, and do what"
"can be done for the poor beast."""
"""You shall always get news of me at Wills’ Coffee House, good Dicon,"""

"*""THE OLD LION.""*"
"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"
eyes.  Did the glance of the other quail ever so little before his?  He
"thought so, but could scarce be certain."
"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he

"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes
"spasm; her eyes are closed, her mouth open, and her jaw a bit"
dislocated. In front of the swooning saint is a little angel who
smilingly threatens her with an arrow.
"“Well, what do you think of it?” said Kennedy."
"“It is wonderful,” exclaimed Cæsar. “But it is a bedroom scene, only"
the lover has slipped away.”
"“Yes, that is true.”"
"“It really is pretty; you seem to see the pallor of the saint’s face,"
"the circles under her eyes, the relaxation of all her muscles. Then the"
angel is a little joker who stands there smiling at the ecstasy of the
saint.”
"“Yes, that’s true,” said Kennedy; “it is all the more admirable for the"
"very reason that it is tender, sensual, and charming, all at once.”"
"“However, this sort of thing is not healthy,” murmured Cæsar, “this"
kind of vision depletes your life-force. One wants to find the same
"things represented in works of art that one ought to look for in life,"
even if they are not to be found in life.”
"“Good! Here enters the moralist. You talk like an Englishman,” exclaimed"
Kennedy. “Let us go along.”
“Where?”
“I have to stop in at the French Embassy a moment; then we can go where
you like.”

“Let us think. What sort of a stone would a politician be most likely to
choose?”
Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous
"with conceit, then I think the ruby must have come from Mr. Trent.”"
"“I am sure of it. And as your author is always in the dumps, I am"
certain he takes naturally to the sapphire.”
“But the emerald—”
“Is emblematic of your deluded Teddy. The solitaire therefore falls
"naturally to Mr. Severance. Well, now that you have got through the"
"first interviews in safety, what are you going to do next?”"
"“Edith, I do not know. They are all so dreadfully in earnest that I"
"believe I shall finally take to my heels in down-right terror. But no, I"
won’t. I’ll come out of it with the upper hand and save my reputation as
"an actress. I will keep it up for two or three days more, but after that"
it will be impossible. They are bound to meet here sooner or later.
"Thank Heaven, we are rid of them for to-night, at least!”"
The manservant threw back the portière.
“Mr. Trent!”
"“Heavens!” cried Edith, under her breath; “I forgot to give orders that"
"we were not receiv—how do you do, Mr. Trent?”"
“And which is his ring?” Jessica made a frenzied dab at the jewels in

"absolutely at the end of his wits for money, and now--I can pay him his"
price for you if you'll keep your promise to me by and by. Otherwise I
"can't; no matter how willing I might be, I can't, I swear to you."

for some part at least of what he and I have lost through your--your
"interfering so much lately in his affairs. And, if you don't back me up"

"take you too, and--you'll never come back."

“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"""Grapple the days to come!"" he said. ""Let Scripture and ethics rot! My"
"men are at your command! Let them ride by stream and forest, moor and"

Francesco looked at the duke through a mist of tears.
"""You know?"" he faltered."
"""For this I came!"" replied the duke, extending his hand. ""You will"
find her whom your heart seeks. Like a golden dawn shall she rise out
"of the past. Blow your horn! Let us not tarry!"""
CHAPTER VIII
THE ANCHORESS OF NARNI
Six days had passed. Once more the sun had tossed night from the sky
and kindled hope in the hymning east. The bleak wilderness barriered
by sea and crag had mellowed into the golden silence of the autumnal
woods. The very trees seemed tongued with prophetic flame. The world
leaped radiant out of the dawn.
"Through the reddened woods rode Francesco, the Duke of Spoleto silent"
"by his side. Gloom still reigned on the pale, haggard face and there"
was no lustre in the eyes that challenged ever the lurking shade of
Death. Six nights and six days had the quest been baffled. Near and
far armor glimmered in the reddened sanctuaries of the woods. Not a
and Anti-vivisectionists and Vegetarians and other miserable
"Little-Englanders, denounced him as a Turk, an assassin, a"
"seventeenth-century Spanish _conquistador_ of the bloodiest type, and"
"held him up to popular execration, and recalled him, and put him on a"
beggarly pension years before he had reached his age limit. He could
tell them stories which seemed (and in truth deserved to be) incredible.
"“John,” said Lady Blount, “has heard all this a thousand times,”--as"
"indeed he had,--“and must be sick to death of it. He is not going out to"
Australia as governor-general.”
"“Who said he was, my dear?” said Sir Oliver."
"“If you did n't imply it, you were talking nonsense, Oliver,” Lady"
Blount retorted.
"“Anyhow, Oliver, do you think John is taking a wise step?” Herold"
hastily interposed.
"“I do,” said he; “a very wise step.”"
"“I don't agree with you at all,” said Lady Blount, with a snap of"
finality.
"“Your remark, my dear,” replied Sir Oliver, “does not impress me in the"
least. When did you ever agree with me?”
"“Never, my dear Oliver,” said Lady Blount, with the facial smile of"
the secretly hostile fencer. “And I thank Heaven for it. I may not be a
"brilliant woman, but I am endowed with common sense.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at her for a moment, with lips parted, as if to"
fraught with significance. Lavender took the precaution to beach the
dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"
heels!

"""It's pretty difficult to tell. Sometimes I wonder what my own real"

"""I wasn't completely briefed on how it ended,"" Entman said delicately."
"""I think the phony specifications got through."""
"""If they did--if things are really as they appear--"""
"Taber smiled in the darkness. ""Are _you_ beginning to doubt, Doctor?"""
"""Oh, be quiet,"" Entman said with friendly petulance. ""I was going to say"
that I was rather proud of those details. If our hostiles out there
"follow my specifications, they'll create androids with much smaller"
lungs and non-porous skin that will give them no end of trouble when
they start chasing frightened householders down the streets of the
"world."""
"Taber chuckled. ""I remember a story about the Japanese Navy. They were"
supposed to have built some ships to specifications stolen in England.
"When launched, they slid out into the bay and tipped over."""
"""It was that fool Rochester who set the rumor afloat."""
"After standing through an awkward minute or two, Castlemain bowed stiffly"
"to the king and the duchess, turned away from our group, and soon left"
the ballroom.
"When Castlemain was gone, we all laughed save the king. Presently he left"
"us, and I saw him beckon Wentworth and Berkeley to his side. I followed"
"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""
"exclaimed the king, impatiently. ""You picked up the wrong woman. But"
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.
"piracy and was to have been executed, but English public feeling ran so"
high that Prowse was discharged.
"PULLING, CAPTAIN JOHN."
"Commanded the _Fame_, which set out in 1703 in company with Dampier in the"
_St. George_ on a plundering expedition to the South Seas. Their
commissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two
"captains quarrelled at the very beginning of the voyage, while lying off"
"the Downs, and Pulling slipped away by himself to go a-pirating amongst"
the Canary Islands.
"PURSSER, CAPTAIN."
In the sixteenth century this pirate became notorious for his piracies off
"the coast of Wales, and with Calles and Clinton, two other pirates, ""grew"
"famous, till Queene Elizabeth of blessed memory, hanged them at Wapping."""
"QUELCH, CAPTAIN JOHN."
A native of Massachusetts Colony.
"In 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,"
"owned by some leading citizens of Boston, and fitted out to go"
privateering off the coasts of Arcadia and Newfoundland. On leaving
"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"
"Quelch their commander. They sailed to the south, and shortly afterwards"
"threw the captain overboard. They hoisted a flag, the ""Old Roger,"""
"described as having ""in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglars in"
"Encouraged by these assurances, one of the newcomers said to the other:"
"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"
to each other:
"""I wonder if there's a war on in these parts--I hear the Huns have made"
"a bit of a push."""
"""Curse the blighters--they'll mess up my leave, it's due in a week's"
"time."""
"""Jolly good coffee, this! Here, Marie, bring us another two cups--der"
"coop der caffay--that's right, isn't it?"""
"""Dat's right,"" said the girl, ""you speak goot French--vous avez tout a"
"fait l'accent parisien."""
"Suddenly her sister came running into the room, sobbing loudly:"
"""English soldier come round from Commandant--he tell us Shermans"
"come--ve got to go 'vay at once, ve got to leave everysing--ve go 'vay"
and English troops steal everysing and shellss come and smash everysing
"and ve looss everysing."""
The civilians of the village had received orders to leave immediately.
Through the window we could see groups of people standing in the street
"his _Euralia Past and Present_ the eminent historian, Roger"
"Scurvilegs, does not spare her; but that she had her great qualities I"
should be the last to deny.
"She had been writing poetry that morning, and she wore green.  She"
"always wore green when the Muse was upon her: a pleasing habit which,"
"whether as a warning or an inspiration, modern poets might do well to"
imitate.  She carried an enormous diary under her arm; and in her mind
several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to
the Palace.
"""Good morning, dear Countess,"" said the King, rising only too gladly"
"from his nibs; ""an early visit."""
"""You don't mind, your Majesty?"" said the Countess anxiously.  ""There"
was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite
"certain----"""
"""What _were_ we talking about yesterday?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty,"" said the Countess, ""affairs of state,"" and she"
"gave him that wicked, innocent, impudent, and entirely scandalous look"
"which he never could resist, and you couldn't either for that matter."
"""Affairs of state, of course,"" smiled the King."
"""Why, I made a special note of it in my diary."""
She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages.
"""Here we are! '_Thursday._  His Majesty did me the honour to consult"
"me about the future of his daughter, the Princess Hyacinth.  Remained"
project will require financial and strategic skills well beyond those
"possessed by the people who have worked for me in the past."""
"""All those petty criminals and hoods, you mean."""
"""I will choose to ignore that,"" he continued. ""Whatever you may wish to"
"call them, they are not proving entirely adequate to the task at hand."
You bested my European people repeatedly and brought me a decided
"humiliation."""
"Speaking of which, Vance found himself suddenly wondering, a thought"
"out of the blue, what's happened to Vera? She's been European point"
woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?
"Mino continued. ""Therefore I must now either take you into my"
"organization or . . ."" He paused. ""It's that simple. Which, I wonder,"
"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”
"informant; 'all, from the earliest memory to the latest breath. Like a"
whole landscape called by a flash of lightning out of the dark night. It
"is all there, every bit of it, good and evil, pleasure and pain, sin and"
righteousness.'
A man cannot escape from his life even in death. In our acts of to-day
"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"
"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

"In February, 1686, Ringrose with one hundred men took the town of Santiago"
"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"
"writes: ""My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was"

"When Captain Quelch was captured with his crew, Roach escaped near the"
Cape by Snake Island. He was afterwards captured and thrown into the gaol
"at Salem. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston, and on June 30th,"
"1704, was hanged. At the place of execution Roach disappointed the"

"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"
He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:
“A most extraordinary person--a most extraordinary _house_!... But I
"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"

all. 'And your gold chain is gone. I believe you have nothing but the
"frock you stand up in. Why, then, should I marry you?'"
"I felt her heart give a great leap under my hand, and a shiver ran"
"through her. But she did not raise her head, and I, who had thought to"
"tease her into looking at me, had to put back her little face till it"
gazed into mine.
'Why?' I said; 'why?'--drawing her closer and closer to me.
Then the colour came into her face like the sunlight itself. 'Because
"you love me,' she whispered, shutting her eyes."
And I did not gainsay her.
CHAPTER XXIV.
MISSING!
"We lay in the osier bed two whole days and a night, during which time"
"two at least of us were not unhappy, in spite of peril and hardship."
"We left it at last, only because our meagre provision gave out, and we"
"must move or starve. We felt far from sure that the danger was over,"
"for Steve, who spent the second day in a thick bush near the road, saw"
"two troops of horse go by; and others, we believed, passed in the"
night. But we had no choice. The neighbourhood was bleak and bare.
"Such small homesteads as existed had been eaten up, and lay abandoned."
"If we had felt inclined to venture out for food, none was to be had."
out. I have no more idea than you have.”
It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."

and social and scientific prestige. When an exposé of the methods
employed by him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the
"name of ""Weaver"" in the medical world is threatened, it is frustrated"
"through the efforts of the famous doctor's younger brother, Dr. Jim."

something inevitable you might as well look at it from the more
"cheerful side. After all, there was the chance that we might not have"
"made it this far, you know. Now, tell me honestly, does it make sense"
getting all worried-up by thinking of how horrible it would have been
"if we'd been caught back there when Seventy-nine blew up?"""
"""I suppose not."""
"""Well, then,"" he said in a semi-cheerful tone, ""since we did make it"
"out safely, and are still waiting after eight days, we might as well"
"expect to be collected soon."""
"Charles Andrews said, from behind him, ""At a hundred dollars an hour,"
"Norton?"""
"Norton turned around angrily. ""So it's the hundred clams per,"" he"
"snapped back. ""That's damned poor payment for having to live with the"
"likes of you in a space can this cramped."""
"Andrews eyed the pilot with distaste. ""Tell me,"" he said smoothly,"
"""did my last effort on the pedal generator go for power storage, or"
for a couple of gallons of hot water for that shave and shower you've
"enjoyed?"""
"Norton stretched and stood up. ""I figured that having a clean face"
"might help morale,"" he said pointedly."
"""You're a cheap, chiseling--"""
"""Easy, Andrews! Easy. There's a lady present. Besides, I might forget"
"my easy-going nature and take a swing at you."""
"name is Villiers. Mr. Alwyn is my guest,--but he is at present very"
"much occupied,--and unless your business is extremely urgent..."""
"""Certainly it is urgent""--said the lady decisively.. ""otherwise I"
"should not have come. And so you are NOT Mr. Alwyn! Well, I thought you"
"couldn't be! Now then, will you have the kindness to tell Mr. Alwyn I"
"am here?"""
"By this time Villiers had recovered his customary self-possession, and"
he met her commanding glance with a somewhat defiant coolness.
"""I am not aware to whom I have the honor of speaking,"" he said"
"frigidly. ""Perhaps you will oblige me with your name?"""
"""My name doesn't in the least matter,"" she replied calmly--""though I"
will tell you afterward if you wish. But you don't seem to understand
"I..._I_ am 'Tiger-Lily'!"""
The situation was becoming ludicrous. Villiers felt strongly disposed
to laugh.
"""I'm afraid I am very ignorant!""--he said, with a humorous sparkle in"
"his blue eyes,--""But really I am quite in the dark as to your meaning."
"Will you explain?"""
"The lady's nose grew deeper of tint, and the look she shot at him had"
quite a killing vindictiveness. With evident difficulty she forced a
smile.
"""Oh, you MUST have heard of me!""--she declared, with a ponderous"
"attempt at playfulness--""You read the papers, don't you?"""
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.

"""Red spot ten miles away,"" said Brand in the transmitter. ""We're"
"approaching it slowly."""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
blow he could.
"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"Coxon showed more interest now, and remarked,"
"""Why, Gaspard was one of Medland's organisers. I saw him with both"
"Medland and Norburn on Saturday."""
"""I don't suppose they were planning to murder this Benham. Indeed, I"
don't see that the thing can have been political at all. What did it
"matter whether Benham lived or died?"""
"""I don't see that it did, except to Benham,"" assented the Captain. ""But"
"what's become of Gaspard?"""
"""Ah, that they don't know. He's supposed to have taken ship, and they've"
"cabled to search all ships that left the port that morning."""
"""He'll find the man in blue--or the local equivalent--on the wharf,"""
"said the Captain. ""Rather a jar that, Sir Robert, when you're in from a"
"voyage. What are they doing now?"""
"""Well, the Superintendent said they were going to have a thorough search"
"through the dead man's lodgings, to see if they could find out anything"
about him which would throw light on the motive. The police don't think
"much of the political theory of the crime."""
"""Dashed nonsense, _I_ should think,"" said the Captain, and he sauntered"
off to play billiards.
"""That young man,"" said the Chief Justice, ""is really not a fool, though"
"he does his best to look like one."""
"""That queer conduct seems to me rather common in young men at home. I"
"The grace of her attitude, the intimacy of the scene, the pleasantness"
"of her greeting, made his task hateful."
"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.
"“Emmeline has discovered, Yvonne, that the man--”"
"He got no further. Yvonne rushed to him with a cry of pain, clung to his"
"arm, broke into wild words."
“Don’t say any more--don’t--don’t. Spare me--for pity’s sake. I did not
"eyes without spectacles, I recognized George Hamilton, and almost choked"
myself in smothering a cry.
"Frances turned to me, asking indignantly, ""Why did not you tell me?"""
"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."
NOTE
"""The Honest Four-Shilling Piece"" (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E.,"
"p. 306, No. 59) stands for the idealization of childish simplicity"
"and honesty, which after much travail, and despite the ill-will of"
"the ""experienced,"" comes into its deserved own."
XIII
THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
"Jack Norton immensely, although he knew that chances of survival were"
"better with Norton's boorish, interfering presence than without. He was"
"bored, he was angry, he was above all resentful of the time wasted in"
this spacewreck business....
"An orderly tapped Commodore Wilson on the shoulder. ""Message from"
"Terra,"" he said."
"Wilson groaned and reached for the telephone beside his bunk. ""Wilson"
"here,"" he said. ""Go ahead!"""
"""Admiral Stone. Wilson, a new ship is on the way. I want you to get"
"into this thing fully, so I'm briefing you now."""
"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"
"that makes it tick. It's piled in with twine and baling wire, and when"
the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"“About two miles on the level,” Frank suggested, “and about four hundred"
miles the way the surface of the ground runs.”
"After a short rest the boys proceeded south, climbing over jutting"
"spurs, dipping into depressions, and sliding over stony slopes until"
they were almost too tired to take another step.
"“We’ll get used to this in a month or two,” Harry said, sitting plump"
down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”
"“Running water, too,” added Frank. “Now, where do you think that water"
"comes from, and where does it go to?”"
"""No one can say. A day, a week, a month, a year--it is an elusive search"
"I follow, my young friends. May I call you that?"""
"We bowed, and I deferentially suggested:"
"""If we can help you in any way?----"""
"""It is the beautiful spirit of America,"" he sighed, ""to help those in"
"distress, yet there is nothing to do but watch--watch. For you have not"
"yet been here long enough to see a child in these waters--no?"""
"Tommy, perhaps because he came from the South and was on more or less"
"friendly terms with superstitions, glanced over the rail as if an infant"
might be floating around almost anywhere. Our strange guest's mysterious
"hints were, indeed, rather conducive to creeps."
"Then, without further comment, he arose, tossed his cigar overboard, ran"
"his fingers through his mass of hair, and went below."
"""What d'you suppose he meant?"" I asked, in a guarded voice."
"""Simple enough,"" Tommy whispered. ""He's got apartments to let"
"upstairs."""
"""Get out, man,"" I laughed. ""That chap has more sense than either of us!"""
"""Then he'd better come across with some of it. You remember the freckled"
"lad at Soissons who got fuzzy-headed from too much concussion? Well, he"
"saw children around everywhere, too! It's a sure sign, Jack!"" But now he"
"laughed, adding: ""Oh, I suppose our little Roumanian's all right,"
"only----"""
"""Attacked!"" she echoed in surprise.  ""No one attacked me."""
"""I did not mean that,"" I answered, rather puzzled at her quick protest."
"""I meant that you were probably aware of the symptoms which preceded"
"your unconsciousness."""
"""I felt a strange dizziness and a curious tightness in the throat and"
chest.  That is all I remember.  All became blank until I opened my eyes
"again and found myself lying here, with these two gentlemen standing at"
my side.  The duration of my unconsciousness did not appear to me longer
"than a few minutes."""
"""Then mademoiselle has no idea of the cause of her strange illness?"""
"inquired Deane in French.  ""None whatever, m'sieur."""
"""Tell us one fact,"" he urged.  ""During the time which elapsed between"
"your parting with M'sieur Ingram and your sudden unconsciousness, did"
"anyone enter the room?"""
"""No one; of that I am absolutely certain."""
"""How were you occupied during that time?"""
"""I was writing a letter."""
"""And before you rose did you feel the curious giddiness?"""
"""No, not until after I stood up.  I tried to shout and attract help, but"
"could not.  Then I reached to press the bell, but stumbled forward, and"
"the next instant I was lost in what seemed to be a dense fog."""
"""Curious!"" ejaculated Trepard, who stood by with folded arms, eagerly"
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Give it to me ...  Perhaps there is something in it about us ..."""
"""About whom?"""
"""About the village."""
"They laughed at him, and threw him the paper.  He took it, and read in"
"it how in the village the hail had destroyed the cornfields, how in"
"another village fire destroyed thirty houses, and that in a third a"
"woman had poisoned her family,--in fact, everything that it is"
"customary to write of,--everything, that is to say, which is bad, and"
which depicts only the worst side of the unfortunate village.  Tyapa
"read all this silently and roared, perhaps from sympathy, perhaps from"
delight at the sad news.
"He passed the whole Sunday in reading his Bible, and never went out"
"collecting rags on that day.  While reading, he groaned and sighed"
"continually.  He kept the book close to his breast, and was angry with"
any one who interrupted him or who touched his Bible.
"""Oh, you drunken blackguard,"" said Kuvalda to him, ""what do you"
"understand of it?"""
"""Nothing, wizard!  I don't understand anything, and I do not read any"
"books ...  But I read ..."""
"""Therefore you are a fool ..."" said the Captain, decidedly. ""When there"
"are insects in your head, you know it is uncomfortable, but if some"
"thoughts enter there too, how will you live then, you old toad?"""
"satellites."""
"""Their vessels are crude, clumsy things. The journey from the nearest"
satellite is the limit of their flying range. They have nothing like
"your wonderful little ships, and they want to know how to build and"
"power them."""

"She gazed sorrowfully at them and went on: ""You see, yours is the"
fourth space ship to visit their kingdom; and that makes them fearful
because it shows they are vulnerable to invasion. They want to stop
"that by invading your planet first. Besides their fear, there is their"
greed. Their looking-tubes reveal that yours is a fruitful and lovely

7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.
"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

"And, be it remembered, for her the doing had been no light ordering--it"
"was a flagellation of her own nakedness with cruel whips; for, as each"
"change obliterated a footprint of the past, the atmosphere in which the"
boy and man had wrought their career swiftly vanished--the very hint of
an early struggle had departed from the place.
Noll felt how the room must have struck Netherby in the face as he
leaped up the stair and flung open the door to be welcomed to its
old genial comradeship after his journey and absence from his beloved
things.
Noll’s eyes came back from his thoughts to rest on the bent shoulders
of the disconsolate man; and Netherby realized that the other had
digested the situation.
"He sighed sadly, his head in his hands:"
“Poor Julia!” he said--“ she must never know. She has done this during
"our absence--as a surprise. And,” he added grimly: “it was!”"
Noll smiled:
"“But, Netherby, my dear old boy; you must not fret. You are famous,"
man----”
“Oh yes--quite. A duchess has asked me to dinner--without my wife.”
Noll put out the light:
"“Let us sit in the dusk for awhile, Netherby, as we have sat many a day"
and settled the affairs of the state. We have laughed at care here;
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.

THE WHAT-SHALL-I-DO GIRL
"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated by Jessie Gillespie. Net $1.25;"
postpaid $1.40_
"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.
man at my time of life! Do you realize that I am twice her age?”
"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"
"the whole of your life before you. Time, my dear boy, is a marvellous"
"solvent of human perplexity. Once in a new world, once in that"
astonishing continent of Australia--”
John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.
"“I'm not going to the damned continent,” said he."
and an uneasy eye.
"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
"truth, I was once a man, though I was not noble.  I care now for"
nothing and nobody ... and all my life has been tame--a sweetheart who
"has jilted me--therefore I despise life, and am indifferent to it."""
"""You lie!"" says Abyedok."
"""I lie?"" roars Aristid Kuvalda, almost crimson with anger."
"""Why shout?"" comes in the cold sad voice of Martyanoff."
"""Why judge others?  Merchants, noblemen ... what have we to do with"
"them?"""
"""Seeing that we are"" ... puts in Deacon Taras."
"""Be quiet, Abyedok,"" says the teacher, goodnaturedly."
"""Why do you provoke him?""  He does not love either discussion or noise,"
and when they quarrel all around him his lips form into a sickly
"grimace, and he endeavours quietly and reasonably to reconcile each"
"with the other, and if he does not succeed in this he leaves the"
"company. Knowing this, the Captain, if he is not very drunk, controls"
"himself, not wishing to lose, in the person of the teacher, one of the"
best of his listeners.
"""I repeat,"" he continues, in a quieter tone, ""that I see life in the"
"hands of enemies, not only enemies of the noble but of everything good,"
"avaricious and incapable of adorning existence in any way."""
"""But all the same,"" says the teacher, ""merchants, so to speak, created"
"Genoa, Venice, Holland--and all these were merchants, merchants from"
"England, India, the Stroyanoff merchants ..."""
"""Don't you sell tea, bread, or anything to eat?"""
"""I trade only in walls and roofs, for which I pay to the swindling"
"proprietor of this hole--Judas Petunikoff, merchant of the second"
"guild--five roubles a month,"" explained Kuvalda in a business-like"
"tone.  ""Only those come to me who are not accustomed to comfort and"
"luxuries .... but if you are accustomed to eat every day, then there is"
the eating-house opposite.  But it would be better for you if you left
off that habit.  You see you are not a gentleman.  What do you eat?
"You eat yourself!"""
"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"
"always with smiling eyes, and also for the attention he paid to his"
lodgers the Captain was very popular among the poor of the town.  It
"very often happened that a former client of his would appear, not in"
"rags, but in something more respectable and with a slightly happier"
face.
"""Good-day, your honour, and how do you do?"""
"""Alive, in good health!  Go on."""
"""Don't you know me?"""
"""I did not know you."""
"""Do you remember that I lived with you last winter for nearly a month"
".... when the fight with the police took place, and three were taken"
"away?"""
"""My brother, that is so.  The police do come even under my hospitable"
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

"Andrews grunted, ""No, he isn't. But Alice, I'm not at all sure that"
"Norton knows whether he's doing the right thing or not."""
"She shook her head. There was no answer to that argument. Furthermore,"
it was the kind of unresolvable argument that could go on and on until
the answer was supplied from the outside. There could be no end to it
until they were either picked up safely or died in lonely space.
"She decided to drop the discussion as pointless, so headed for the"
bathroom. A hot shower and a quick tubbing of her underclothing were
"on her mind. Her garments, of course, would dry instantly. She had"
to smile a little. To think that a hundred years ago women thought
something they called nylon was wonderful because it was fairly
"quick-drying! Not instantaneous, of course, as was the material of"
which her lingerie was made.
"Anyhow, getting it clean now, and having a bath herself would make"
her feel better. And she would be better equipped to face the
nerve-gruelling business of just sitting there watching the clock go
"around and around, with nothing to do but wait."

"Regin Naylo faced his superior with a scowl. ""That rips it wide open,"""
he said.
torrent of rain beat upon the Frangipani's streaming face; he tottered
"on his knees, but still held his hands to the heavens."
"""They lied,"" he cried. ""Give me but life.""--"
The duke looked at him and heaved up his sword.
"Giovanni Frangipani saw the white face above him, gave a great cry and"
cowered behind his hands. It was all ended in a moment. The rain
washed his gilded harness as he lay with his blood soaking into the
crevices of the rocks.--
Francesco had witnessed neither the fight nor the ending. Impelled by
"an insensate desire to find Raniero, to have a final reckoning for all"
"the baseness and insults he had heaped upon him in the past, for his"
"treachery and cruelty to Ilaria, he had made his way to the great"
hall.
The door was closed and locked from within.
Francesco dealt it a terrific blow. Its shattered framework heaved
inward and toppled against the wall.
In the doorway stood Raniero and looked out at his opponent. He did
not recognize Francesco. His face was sullen; the glitter of his
little eyes mimicked the ring gleams of his hauberk. He put out the
tip of a tongue and moistened his lips.
Francesco's face was as the face of a man who has but one purpose left
"in life and, that accomplished, cares not what happens. Raising his"
"vizor, he said:"

CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."

EVIDENCE BEFORE THE PUBLIC SERVICES COMMISSION
"The following is the evidence given by Dr. J. C. Bose, C. S. I., C. I."
"E., Professor of Physics, Presidency College, Calcutta, on the 18th"
"December, 1913, before the Royal Commission on the Public Services in"
"India, presided over by Lord Islington, and published, in the Minutes of"
"Evidence relating to the Education Department, at pages 135 to 137, in"
"volume XX, Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners:"
WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
"83, 627 (I) _Method of recruitment._--The first question on which I have"
been asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment. I
think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
"qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,"
Thursday 2:28 P.M.
"""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino"
"said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been"
"completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring"
"the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"""The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,"" Taro Ikeda, the project"
"director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. ""It is the Soviet"
"pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced."" He looked down, searching for"
"the right words. ""I'm concerned. I think he has discovered the stealth"
"capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the same,"
I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
"capabilities."""
"""_So deshoo_."" Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed. ""But he has said nothing?"""
"""No. Not a word. At least to me."""
"""Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It would not be the"
"first time."""
"""The maneuvers. They were too explicit,"" Ikeda continued. ""As I said,"
"two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched off the"
"transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a"
"power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-"
"evasive action."" The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic"
"smile. ""At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's"
commoners unless raised in rank by marriage or merit.
(_f_) The title _Lady_ belongs to daughters of all noblemen not lower
than earl.
(_g_) The title _Hon._ belongs to daughters of viscounts and barons;
"also to an untitled woman who becomes a maid-of-honor to the Queen,"
and this title is retained after she leaves the service. If a woman who
has the title _Lady_ becomes maid-of-honor she does not acquire the
title _Hon._
Index compound names according to the usage of the author's
"fatherland, though if it is known that his practice differs from"
"this usage, his preference should be followed. Compound names"
then go:
"(_a_) If English, under the last part of the name, when the first has"
"not been used alone by the author: e.g., _Gould, Sabine Baring-_;"
"but _Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O._, and _Locker"
"(afterwards Locker-Lampson)_, because they are well-known under the"
first names.
"(_b_) If foreign, under the first part."
Both such compound names as _Gentil-Bernard_ and such as _Gentil de
"Chavagnac_. There are various exceptions, when a name has been more"
"known under the last part, as _Fénelon_, not _Salignac de Lamothe"
"Fénelon_; _Voltaire_, not _Arouet de Voltaire_; _Sternberg_, not"
"_Ungern-Sternberg_. Moreover, it is not always easy to determine"
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references are necessary
"whichever way one decides each case, especially when the second part"
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.
"lately?"""
"""Very well, I believe. The men were down the other day, and told me it"
"was a big thing."""
"""I'm delighted. How does it seem, to be rich?"""
There was the slightest hint of constraint in the girl's voice as she
"stared out at the slowly gathering twilight, murmuring:"
"""I--I hardly know. Rich! That has always been my dream, and yet--"""
"""The wonderful feature about dreams,"" he took advantage of her pause to"
"say, ""is that they come true."""
"""Not all of them--not the real, wonderful dreams,"" she returned."
"""Oh yes! My dream is coming true, and so is yours."""
"""I have given up hoping for that,"" she said, without turning."
"""But you shouldn't give up. Remember that all the great things ever"
"accomplished were only dreams at first, and the greater the"
"accomplishments, the more impossible they seemed to begin with."""
Something in the girl's attitude and in her silence made him feel that
"his words rang hollow and commonplace. While they had talked, an"
"unaccustomed excitement had been mounting in his brain, and it held him"
now in a kind of delicious embarrassment. It was as if both had been
"suddenly enfolded in a new and mysterious understanding, without the"
need of speech. He did not tell himself that Cherry loved him; but he
"roused to a fresh perception of her beauty, and felt himself privileged"
"19. The Captors shall, with all practicable Speed after the captured"
"Ship is brought into Port, bring Three or Four of the Principal Persons"
belonging to the captured Ship before the Judge of the Court or some
"Person authorised in this behalf, by whom they shall be examined on Oath"
on the Standing Interrogatories.
"The Preparatory Examinations on the Standing Interrogatories shall, if"
"possible, be concluded within Five Days from the Commencement thereof."
[Sidenote: Adjudication by Court.]
"20. After the Return of the Monition, the Court shall, on Production of"
"the Preparatory Examinations and Ship Papers, proceed with all"
convenient Speed either to condemn or to release the captured Ship.
[Sidenote: Further Proof.]
"21. Where, on Production of the Preparatory Examinations and Ship"
"Papers, it appears to the Court doubtful whether the captured Ship is"
"good Prize or not, the Court may direct further Proof to be adduced,"
"either by Affidavit or by Examination of Witnesses, with or without"
"Pleadings, or by Production of further Documents; and on such further"
Proof being adduced the Court shall with all convenient Speed proceed to
Adjudication.
"[Sidenote: Custody, &c. of Ships of War.]"
"22. The foregoing Provisions, as far as they relate to the Custody of"
"the Ship, and to Examination on the Standing Interrogatories, shall not"
apply to Ships of War taken as Prize.
then! I felt that I had become a different being altogether.
The boat entered the harbour and ran alongside the quay. A train was
waiting for us. We poured out of the ship in two streams that spread out
fan-wise and flowed into the carriages.
It was good to sit by the window in a comfortable compartment and lean
back against soft cushions.
Glad anticipation and barely suppressed excitement were visible on
everybody's face.
"The train sped through familiar country: meadows, pastures, cornfields,"
orchards and woodlands. People waved their handkerchiefs at us from
cottage windows.
It was growing dark as the first rows of drab suburban houses began to
glide past.
So this was London. I stared out of the window and tried to grasp the
"tremendous, wonderful fact with all the power of my mind. Somehow or"
"other it did not seem real, but I felt I could make it real by an effort"
of the will.
Streets and houses and moving people soon crowded the whole view. The
people filled me with intense curiosity. I longed to talk to them and
find out what they felt and thought about the war.
We entered Victoria Station. I opened the door of the compartment with
"hasty, trembling hands. I did not wait to change my French money, but"
hurried out into a street and got on to a 'bus.
"asked the man. ""There is an old hair strainer for you. I found it"
"outside on the ground,"" said he, and he threw it on the bench. And"
then his wife saw him; but at the same moment the hat of the _huldres_
"disappeared, for he should only have loaned it, not given it away."
"Now the man saw how everything had come about, and went back to the"
"wedding-feast. And this time he was received in right friendly fashion,"
"and was asked to drink, and to seat himself at the table."
NOTE
A favorite jewel among the treasures of the underground world
"plays the leading part of the tale: ""The Hat of the _Huldres_"""
"(Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I, p. 157; from the vicinity of"
"Eidsvold, told by an old peasant woman). Often appearing in"
"legend proper as the tarn-cap, it here finds a more humble place"
"in everyday life, neither ennobled by legendary dignity, nor"
diversified by the rich incident of fairy-tale. The entertaining
picture here afforded of its powers shows them all the more
clearly.

THE CHILD OF MARY
"Far, far from here, in a great forest, there once lived a poor couple."
Heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter; but they were so
poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened. So her
"the greater number of her clothes, hers was the heavier sack. Thus had"
they shifted their burdens; what burdens would they carry in the future?
"She was, after all, no longer a schoolmistress, and perhaps he was no"
longer with the theater or the films.
"I watched those two crossing rocky, mountainous ground, bare ground, with"
not a tree anywhere except a few stunted junipers; far away near the ridge
"murmured the little Reisa. Those two had put their possessions together,"
"were walking together; at the next halt they would be man and wife, and"
take only one room because it was cheaper.
"Suddenly I started up and, moved by some impulse of human sympathy--nay,"
"of duty--I wanted to run across to her, talk to her, say a word of"
"warning: ""Don't go on!"" I could have done it in a few minutes--a good"
"deed, a duty...."
They disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.
Her name was Ingeborg.

"And now I, too, must wander on again, for I am the last at the Tore Peak"
"farm. The season is wearing on, and this morning it snowed for the first"
"time--wet, sad snow."

"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Very curious indeed!"""
"""What is curious?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""Those marks,"" he answered, indicating them with his finger.  ""They are"
"very puzzling.  I've never seen such marks before."""
"""Do they point to foul play?""  I inquired, feeling suspicious that she"
had by some mysterious means fallen the victim of an assassin.
"""Well, no,"" he responded, after some hesitation; ""that is not my"
"opinion."""
"""Then what is your opinion?"""
"""At present I have none.  I can have none until I make a thorough"
"examination.  There are certainly no outward marks of violence."""
"""We need not inform the police, I suppose?"""
"""Not at present,"" he replied, his eyes still fixed upon the blanched"
face of the woman who had once been all the world to me.
"I raised her dead hand, and upon it imprinted a last fervent kiss.  It"
was cold and clammy to my lips.  In that hour all my old love for her
"had returned, and my heart had become filled with an intense bitterness"
"and desolation.  I had thought that all my love for her was dead, and"
"that Edith Austin, the calm, sweet woman far away in an English county,"
"who wrote to me daily from her quiet home deep in the woodlands, had"
"taken her place.  But our meeting and its tragic sequel had, I admit,"
than it is in any of Croce's writings. We are probably touching here
"on one of the possible, and probable, lines of development of Croce's"
"philosophy; which, however, will not become actual until the historical"
"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently
"to recreate the life of which these are but the dead spoils, the"
"accumulated vestiges, by the same process by which history re-kindles"
"the old chronicles into new, contemporary life. That such a development"
"is implied in Croce's own theory of history can hardly be questioned,"
"though, when realized, it will undoubtedly react on more than one point"
of Croce's logic.

"""Nothing to report,"" announced Barracombe, as Aubyn relieved him as"
"officer of the watch. ""A jolly fine night. I shouldn't wonder if we"
"were favoured by a visit from a Zeppelin or two."""
"""A pretty jamb in the harbour,"" said Terence, giving a quick glance"
"at the maze of vessels. ""Fortunately, I hear, we've several seaplanes"
"at our disposal."""
Barracombe wished his relief good-night and descended the ladder to
retire to the seclusion of his cabin and sleep the sleep of
"exhaustion, for he had had a strenuous time before the cruiser left"
Devonport.
During the first hour nothing unusual occurred. The midshipman of the
"watch reported ""Rounds all correct, sir,"" to which Aubyn replied with"
"the stereotyped ""Very good."" Across the harbour came the faint hail"
of the Night Guard as the picquet boat studiously visited every
vessel within the limits of the breakwater.
The masthead light of the flagship began to blink. A signalman on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge snatched up a slate."
"""General call, sir,"" he announced."
"Deftly the man took down the message, then hurried to the chart-room"
to decipher the code.
"""Submarine E27 reports three hostile aeroplanes passing S.W. by W."
"Position eleven miles N.N.E. of North Goodwin."""
"The warning was a brief one, for hardly had the ship's company been"
"bowed deferentially. ""You are about to receive a great honor. The CEO"
"has asked for a private conference with you."""
Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All this right-
wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He was
the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?
"Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick glance. Yuri"
"Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew there"
was trouble ahead.
Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and headed
"over. ""Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,"" he said in flawless Russian,"
"bowing lightly. ""A genuine pleasure to meet you at last. There's a most"
"urgent matter we have to discuss."""
Thursday 4:00 P.M.
"At the precise hour, the _tokonoma _alcove off Vance's bedroom rotated"
"ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what awaited"
"beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of"
"course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be"
thriving on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a
curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular
"curves, and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks"
nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean
waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in Chinese
Sung landscape paintings.

"""You seem always the same ...  Are you always joking?"""
"""What else can one do, living among you unfortunate men?"""
"They went.  Sometimes the Captain's former customer, uplifted and"
"unsettled by the entertainment, returned to the dosshouse, and on the"
following morning they would again begin treating each other till the
Captain's companion would wake up to realise that he had spent all his
money in drink.
"""Your honour, do you see that I have again fallen into your hands?"
"What shall we do now?"""
"""The position, no doubt, is not a very good one, but still you need not"
"trouble about it,"" reasoned the Captain.  ""You must, my friend, treat"
"everything indifferently, without spoiling yourself by philosophy, and"
without asking yourself any question.  To philosophise is always
"foolish; to philosophise with a drunken headache, ineffably so."
Drunken headaches require vodki and not the remorse of conscience or
hysteric desire to talk loudly and hide his chagrin; and he turned at
"the sound of Fosse’s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal."
"Fosse in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the"
discussion round about him:
"“In the arts,” he was saying, “woman does not, cannot, shine. She only"
exists--on sufferance. A woman’s province----”
Myre had strolled towards the voice:
"“I am flattered to find,” said he, “that Mr. Fosse has been reading me."
He is right. A woman’s province is to be beautiful; and if she write
at all she may write of the nursery--of the domesticities. A woman
has not the experiences of life--she writes only from intuition. She
cannot experience the emotions of a man--cannot describe all shades of
life--is too careful of her skirts to have been on the heights and in
the gutters----”
Lovegood coughed:
"“Never,” said he, with big deliberate voice--“never shall I again"
approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.”
Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:
"“A woman,” said he, “cannot be in the thrash and fume of life. She only"
peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the doings of the world.
She has not physical strength----”
Somebody coughed:
“Tra-la-lee!” said he--“opera--bouffe--bouffe--bouffe.”
"""Jack,"" I prompted, more than ever embarrassed and wishing the ocean"
"would come up and swallow me; for I realized, alas, that my gods, by"
"whom I was reasonably well remembered in so far as concerned physique,"
had been shamelessly remiss in their bestowal of brains.
"""Jack?"" she slowly repeated. ""What an odd name!"""
This made me feel queer.
"""Where do you live,"" I asked, ""that you think it's an odd name? The"
"States are crawling with Jacks! It's even the Democratic emblem!"""
Her perplexity was fast approaching alarm when we heard a muffled report
"above, followed by a trembling of the yacht. Someone called an order"
that sounded far away in the wind.
"""Hold tight,"" I said, ""while I see if anything's wrong!"""
"But I did not leave her side, knowing exactly what had happened. We had"
"snapped our mainsheet, that was all; letting the boom swing out and"
putting us in the trough of the waves where we might expect a few wobbly
minutes until the sailors could work in a new line. There was no danger
"and I reassured her at once, but she merely asked:"
"""Was my father on deck?"""
"""I didn't look,"" I answered, wondering why she thought I knew."
"""Won't you see?"" Her patience was becoming exhausted."
"""I'm crazy to. But first let me help you back--you can't make it"
With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during

"""Going to Havana?"""
"This, too, I admitted."
"""Well, there's a feller by the desk who missed the steamer, and he"
"hoped--er----"""
"""We'd take him over,"" Tommy supplied the halting words. ""Where is he?"""
"Turning, we easily distinguished the man by his timid glances in our"
direction.
"""Whiz-bang,"" Tommy whispered. ""What the deuce would you call it, Jack?"""
"Except for his age, that might have been sixty, he was most comical to"
"look upon--in stature short and round, suggesting kinship with a gnome."
"His head seemed too large for the body, yet this might have been because"
"it carried a plenteous shock of straw-colored hair, with mustache and"
"beard to match. He was attired in ""knickers"" and pleated jacket, that"
"looked as if he'd slept in them, and his fat legs were knock-kneed. On"
the floor about his feet lay almost every conceivable type and age of
"traveling bag, with the inevitable camera."
"""What's his name?"" Tommy asked, not that that would have made any"
difference if his passport were in order.
"""Registered as 'Monsieur Dragot, of Roumania,'"" the proprietor answered."
"""Roumania!"" Tommy looked at me. ""Let's go meet him, Jack."""
"Monsieur Dragot turned out to be the original singed cat, for assuredly"
he possessed more attractive qualities inside than were exteriorly
"suppose both of you will have to one of these days, when you get older;"
but I don't like to think of it.”
"“I don't believe I shall ever marry, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
“Why?”
Herold looked out to sea for a wistful instant. “Because one can't marry
"a dream, my dear.”"
"“I've married hundreds,” said Stella, softly."
"If they had been alone together, they would have talked dreams and"
"visions and starshine and moonshine, and their conversation would"
have been about as sensible and as satisfactory to each other and as
intelligible to a third party as that of a couple of elves sitting on
adjacent toadstools; but elves don't talk in the presence of a third
"party, even though he be John Risca and Great High Belovedest. And"
"Stellamaris, recognizing this instinctively, turned her eyes quickly to"
Risca.
"“And you, dear--will you ever marry?”"
"“Never, by Heaven!” cried John, with startling fervency."
Stella reached out both her hands to the two men who incorporated the
"all in all of her little life, and each man took a hand and kissed it."
"“I don't want to be horrid and selfish,” she said; “but if I lost either"
"of you, I think it would break my heart.”"
The men exchanged glances. John repeated his query: “Do you think it's
"""Yes.  Have you brought the hydrated peroxide of iron?"""
"For answer the Frenchman produced the tiny tube, saying:"
"""Then you suspect poison?"""
"""Most certainly,"" he replied; and, taking a glass, he placed a single"
"pillule in it, dissolving it in water, which he afterwards forced"
between the grey lips of my unconscious love.  Afterwards he glanced at
"his watch, observing: ""We must give another in fifteen minutes."""
"Then, drawing a chair to the bedside, he seated himself, holding her"
wrist and watching her countenance for any change that might take place
there.
"""Have you no idea of the nature of the poison?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""None,"" he responded.  ""Ask me no questions now.  When we have brought"
her round will be time enough.  It should be sufficient for you to know
that she is not dead.  Why not leave us for the present?  Go and break
"the good news to the Countess."""
"""You wish to be alone?"""
"""Yes.  This is a serious matter.  Leave us undisturbed, and on no"
"pretext allow her mother to enter here."""
"Thus urged, and feeling reassured by their statement that she still"
lived and that the pulsations of her heart were already quite
"perceptible, I left the room, noiselessly closing the door after me, and"
sought the Countess in the small blue boudoir to which she had returned
plunged in grief and dark despair.
"who thinks a diamond is the truth and paste a lie, is a stupid fool who"
doesn’t deserve to be read.’”
"“Yes, all right: you take one point of view and he takes another. I"
understand why Ruskin wouldn’t please you. What I do not understand is
why you find it absurd that if a person has a desire to penetrate into
"the beauties of a symphony or a picture, he should do so. What is there"
strange in that?”
"“You are right,” said Cæsar; “whoever wants to learn, should. I have"
done so about financial questions.”
“Is it true that your brother knows all about questions of money?”
Kennedy asked Laura.
“He says so.”
“I haven’t much belief in his financial knowledge.”
“No?”
"“No, I have not. You are a sort of dilettante, half nihilist, half"
"financier. You would like to pass for a tranquil, well-balanced man, for"
"what is called a philistine, but you cannot compass it.”"
"“I will compass it. It is true that I want to be a philistine, but a"
philistine out in the real world. All those great artists you people
"admire, Goethe, Ruskin, were really philistines, who were in the"
business of being interested in poetry and statues and pictures.”
"“Moncada, you are a sophist,” said Kennedy. “Possibly I am wrong in this"
"discussion,” retorted Cæsar, “but the feeling I have is right. Artists"
Not till he has learnt will he desire to enter into the straight road.
But in the end all men will come. We at the last shall all meet together

I have not spoilt it in the retelling.
CHAPTER XXV
CONCLUSION
This is the end of my book. I have tried always as I wrote to remember
the principles that I laid down for myself in the first chapter. Whether
"I have always done so I cannot say. It is so difficult, so very"
"difficult, to understand a people--any people--to separate their beliefs"
"from their assents, to discover the motives of their deeds, that I fear"
I must often have failed.
My book is short. It would have been easy to make a book out of each
"chapter, to write volumes on each great subject that I have touched on;"
but I have not done so--I have always been as brief as I could.
"I have tried always to illustrate only the central thought, and not the"
"innumerable divergencies, because only so can a great or strange thought"
"be made clear. Later, when the thought is known, then it is easy to"
"stray into the byways of thought, always remembering that they are"
"byways, wandering from a great centre."
CHAPTER XIV
"""SALLIE HARRIS"""
Sallie's first startled impulse was to deny the new identity Slyne had
so glibly bestowed on her. It seemed too preposterous to be believable;
"and she was very suspicious of him. A little flushed, more than a little"
"afraid, and yet in some sense convinced in spite of herself by the"
outward and visible signs about her that all these strange happenings
"must have at least some foundation of fact, she sought to read the"
others' thoughts in their faces.
"The Marquis of Ingoldsby was gaping at her, in open wonder and"
"admiration. Slyne's features wore a subdued expression of triumph, and"
"Captain Dove's a dazed, incredulous frown. Mr. Jobling was beaming about"
"him, so apparently satisfied with her, so respectably prosperous-looking"
himself that her doubts as to Slyne's good faith began to give way. When
the lawyer was in turn presented to her and also addressed her by that
"new name, she could scarcely disclaim it."
"""You'll stay and have luncheon with us, Lord Ingoldsby?"" Slyne remarked,"
touching the bell; and his lordship left off gaping at Sallie to look
him over with all the solemn sagacity of a young owl in broad daylight.
"""Er--all right,"" his lordship at length agreed. ""Don't mind if I do."
"""Though I have some--er--friends waitin' for me,"" he added as an"
"machinery in it, and to it go connecting beams from all the square"
"metal plates everywhere. That is all I know."""
"Brand started to question her further, but her time was up. The two"
guards poked their loathsome pumpkin heads in the doorway and
"contemptuously beckoned her out. She answered resignedly, in the"
"piping Rogan tongue, and went with them. But she turned to wave shyly,"
commiseratingly at the two men; and the expression in her clear blue
eyes as they rested on Brand made his heart contract and then leap on
with a mighty bound.
"""We have in ally in her,"" murmured Brand. ""Though God only knows if"
"that will mean anything to us...."""
CHAPTER IV
_In the Tower_
"""What I can't figure out,"" said Dex, striding up and down the big bare"
"room, ""is why we're needed to tell them about the atomic motor."
"They've got our ship, and three others besides. I should think they"
"could learn about the motor just by taking it apart and studying it."""
"Brand grinned mirthlessly, recalling the three years of intensive"
study it had taken him to learn the refinements of atomic motive
"power. ""If you'd ever qualified as a space navigator, Dex, you'd know"
better. The Rogans are an advanced race; their control of polar
magnetism and the marvelously high-powered telescopes Greca mentions
say that the woman only suffers in such cases; the man never.  Whether
that rule proves always true will be shown in this strange story of my
own love.
"She drew her hand away slowly, but forcibly, saying:"
"""You cannot love two women.  Already you have shown a preference for a"
"wife of your own people."""
"""It is all over between us,"" I protested.  ""Mine was a mere passing"
"fancy, engendered, I think, by the loneliness I suffered when I lost"
"you."""
"""Ah,"" (she smiled sadly), ""that is all very well!  A woman, when once"
"played false by the man she loves and trusts, is never the"
"same--_never_!"""
"""Then am I to understand, Yolande, that you refuse to pardon me, or to"
"accept my affection?"""
"""I have already pardoned you,"" she faltered; ""but to accept the love you"
"once withdrew from me without just reason is, I regret to say,"
"impossible."""
"""You speak coldly, as though you were refusing a mere invitation to"
"dinner, or something of no greater importance,"" I protested.  ""I offer"
"you my whole heart, my love--nay, my life;"" and I held her hand again,"
"looking straight into those wonderful eyes, now so calm, so serious,"
that my gaze wavered before them.
"Slowly she shook her head, and her trembling breast rose and fell again."

"'an intrusion from without, an inexplicable obsession.']"

AVIATION IN DREAMS
Dreams of Flying and Falling--Their Peculiar Vividness--Dreams of
Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences--Best explained
as based on Respiratory Sensations combined with Cutaneous
Anaesthesia--The Explanation of Dreams of Falling--The Sensation
of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic Saints--Also
experienced at the Moment of Death.
"Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are sometimes associated"
"with, may fairly be considered the best known and most frequent type of"
dream. They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention. Ruths
"argues that the Greek conception of the flying Hermes, the god who"
"possessed special authority over dreams, was based on such experiences."
"Lucretius, in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,"
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;[100] Cicero appears to refer
to dreams of flying; St. Jerome mentions that he was subject to them;
Synesius remarked that in dreams we fly with wings and view the world
from afar; Cervantes accurately described the dream of falling.[101] From
difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.
"""As you say, _Mino-sama_,"" Ikeda bowed. ""I merely wanted to make you"
aware of my concern about the pilot. He should be monitored more
"closely from now on."""
"""Which is precisely what I intend to do."" Tanzan Mino's silver hair"
"seemed to blend with the sea beyond. ""There is an obvious solution."
"When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be alone."""
"""What are you suggesting? No one else--"""
"""Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable, then steps"
"must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with him."""
"""You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was designed to"
"accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the two"
"researchers."""
"""No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the Boeing. Then if"
"Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way, they will"
"be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is solved."" He"
"revolved back from the window. ""That will be all."""
"Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door. He"
"didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully in"
command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would
have to be started immediately.
"After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and activated a"
line of personal video monitors beside his desk.
"""Frankly, I haven't had time to read them. However, I think there is"
little doubt as to the mood of my people. They will be indignant and
"angry at Washington bungling."""
He pointed to another hand.
"""Senator, granting the details you outlined are accurate, have you any"
"knowledge as to--"""
"""Young man. _Every_ detail I outlined was completely accurate."" Senator"
Crane withered the reporter with a hostile look and pointed elsewhere.
"""Senator, did you consult with the people responsible for handling the"
"situation before making your speech?"""
"""I tried. I was willing to co-operate in every way, but my patience ran"
"out. Also, I was alarmed at the bungling and inefficiency I saw. For"
"that reason I went straight to the people with my story."""
"""Senator, I have a wire from the governor of your state. It just arrived"
in response to my query as to his attitude on this affair. The governor
"says, quote, _No comment_, unquote. Would _you_ care to comment on his"
"statement?"""
Senator Crane thought he heard a faint ripple of mirth drift across the
"room. But, of course, he had to be mistaken. ""I think the governor"
replied wisely. I expect to return home and confer with him as soon as
"possible."""
"""Senator, can you explain why, out of all the able, sincere officials in"
"Washington, D.C., elected or otherwise, you were the only one with"
"settled his saucer on the _tatami _and looked up. ""Of course, any"
"questions you have, I would be--"""
"""Okay, how's this. What do you expect to get out of me?"""
"He laughed. ""Why nothing at all. Our reunion here is merely intended to"
serve as a tutorial. To remind you and others how upsetting I find
"intrusions into my affairs."""
"""Then how about starting off this 'tutorial' with a look at your new"
"plane?"" Vance glanced around. ""Guess I should call it _Daedalus_."""
"""_Daedalus I _and_ II. _There actually are two prototypes, although"
only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic regime.
"Yes, I expected the _Daedalus_ would intrigue you. You are a man of"
"insatiable intellectual appetite."""
"""I'm not sure that's necessarily a compliment."""
"""It wasn't necessarily meant to be. Sometimes curiosity needs to be"
"curbed. But if we can agree on certain matters, I shall enjoy providing"
"you a personal tour, to satisfy that curiosity. You are a man who can"
well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic
"coup."""
"The old boy's finally gone off the deep end, Vance told himself."
"Megalomania. ""Incidentally, by 'strategic coup' I suppose you're"
referring to the fact you've got them exactly where you want them. The
"Soviets."""
"""What do you mean?"" His eyes hardened slightly."

"“Now, these ginks will be watching me every minute, waiting for a chance"
"to shoot. You may catch them off their guard directly and when you do,"
cut and run!”
“So that’s what you did all the talking for?” queried Jack.
"“You bet!” answered Frank. “And while you’re running, I’ll do a little"
sprinting myself.”
"“Here, you!” shouted the leader, almost lifting Frank’s feet from the"
ground as he dragged him away.
“What were you whispering to that boy?” demanded one of the others.
"“I was telling him,” Frank answered, making an insulting face, “that I"
used to have a dog that looked exactly like you.”
The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy with upraised fist. The
"leader blocked his rush by imposing his own burly form, and the two went"
"down together. The half-breeds sprang forward, too, the intention"
evidently being to assist their companion as against the leader.
"Frank let out a yell which might have been heard half a mile away, and"
"the three boys darted down the mountainside, followed by harmless shots"
from the guns of the half-breeds.
The incident had taken place on a rocky level flanked by steep slopes on
"each side. The place, in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into"
a long fifty percent grade.

"briskly. After visiting a ""dry"" café, to seal this fortunate"
acquaintanceship--as he insisted upon calling it--he warmed up to us and
"we to him, with the result that his bags were soon carried down and"
"stowed in our spare stateroom. Leaving him there, we went on deck."
"""Dragot,"" Tommy mused. ""Speaks with a slight accent, but I can't make"
"out what!"""
"""Roumanian, possibly,"" I suggested, ""as he comes from there."""
"""You rather excel yourself,"" he smiled. ""Registering from Roumania,"
"however, isn't prima facie evidence that he's a Roumanian."""
"""He's a clever little talker, all the same."""
"""Right O! Too clever. I'm wondering if we aren't a pair of chumps to"
"take him."""
"""Why?"""
"""He may be a crook, for all we know. Did you notice what he said about"
"holding a commission from Azuria, and then hurrying to explain that"
Azuria isn't on the ordinary maps--just a wee bit of a kingdom up in the
"Carpathians, yet in the confines of Roumania? I call that fishy!"""
"""Not entirely so, Tommy. When you said it might now be turning into a"
"republic, did you notice how proudly he declared that the descendants of"

"escaping the ravages of the Bulgarian army, they were stronger today"
"than ever?"""

"Near them, at a table close by, was a little blond man, with a hooked"
"nose and a scanty imperial, in company with a fat lady. They bowed to"
Marchmont and his wife.
"“That gentleman looks like a Jew,” said Cæsar."
"“He is,” replied Marchmont, “that is Señor Pereyra, a rich Jew; of"
"Portuguese origin, I think.”"
“How quickly you saw it!” exclaimed Susanna.
"“He has that air of a sick goat, so frequent in Jews.”"
"“His wife has nothing sickly about her, or thin either,” remarked Laura."
"“No,” said Cæsar; “his wife represents another Biblical type; one of"
"the fat kine of somebody’s dream, which foretold abundance and a good"
harvest.”
"The Englishman, Kennedy, had also little liking for Jews."
"“I do not hate a Jew as anti-Christian,” said Cæsar; “but as"
"super-Christian. Nor do I hate the race, but the tendency they have"
"never to be producers, but always middlemen, and because they incarnate"
"so well for our era the love of money, and of joy and pleasure.”"
"The English author was a great partisan of Jews, and he asserted that"
they were more distinguished in science and the arts than any other
"race. The Jewish question was dropped in an instant, when they saw a"
smart lady come in accompanied by a pale man with a black shock of hair
Not many minutes had passed after their perilous descent when a sphere
"of fire shot from the clouds, followed by a crash as if the earth had"
"been rent in twain, and the western tower of Astura was seen toppling"
into the sea.
"Bye and bye sea and land reflected a crimson glow, which steadily"
"increased, fanned by the gale, until it shone far out upon the sea."
"Astura was in flames, the funeral pyre of the Frangipani."
CHAPTER VII
THE QUEST
"As the world grew gray with waking light, Francesco came from the"
woods and heard the noise of the sea in the hush that breathed in the
dawn. The storm had passed over the sea and a vast calm hung upon the
lips of the day. In the east a green streak shone above the hills. The
sky was still aglitter with sparse stars. An immensity of gloom
brooded over the sea.
"Gaunt, wounded, triumphant, Francesco rode up beneath the banners of"
"the dawn, eager yet fearful, inspired and strong of purpose. Wood and"
hill slept in a haze of mist. The birds were only beginning in the
"thickets, like the souls of children yet unborn, calling to eternity."
"Beyond in the cliffs, San Nicandro, wrapped round with night, stood"
silent and sombre athwart the west.
"""How can you ask me?"" answered the maiden. ""You have been sitting here"
"yourself, and talking about our wedding the whole afternoon!"""
"""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who"
"had taken my shape!"""
Then she gradually came to her senses; but not until long afterward was
"she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that"
"her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been"
"there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that"
"they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their"
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day.
NOTE
Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor
"dairy-maid in ""The Troll Wedding"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I,"
"p. 50. From Hadeland, told by a _Signekjarring_, a kind of wise"
woman or herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll
magic and witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the
place where it is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to
"its original form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like"
"to turn into skeins of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly"
away.

"""showing himself."""
"""Your description of her does not strike me as particularly"
"attractive,""--he said--""I cannot endure that nineteenth-century"
"hermaphroditic production, a mannish woman."""
"""Oh but she isn't altogether mannish,""--declared Villiers, . ."
"""Besides, I mustn't forget to add, that she is extremely beautiful."""
Alwyn shrugged his shoulders indifferently. His friend noticed the
gesture and laughed.
"""Still impervious to beauty, old boy?""--he said gayly--""You always"
"were, I remember!"""
"Alwyn flushed a little, and rose from his chair."
"""Not always,""--he answered steadily,--""There have been times in my life"
"when the beauty of women,--mere physical beauty--has exercised great"
influence over me. But I have lately learned how a fair face may
"sometimes mask a foul mind,--and unless I can see the SUBSTANCE of Soul"
"looking through the SEMBLANCE of Body, then I know that the beauty I"
"SEEM to behold is mere Appearance, and not Reality. Hence, unless your"
"beautiful Duchess be like the 'King's daughter' of David's psalm, 'all"
glorious WITHIN'--her APPARENT loveliness will have no charm for
"me!--Now""--and he smiled, and spoke in a less serious tone.. ""if you"
"have no objection, I am off to my room to scribble for an hour or so."
Come for me if you want me--you know I don't in the least mind being

"But Villiers detained him a moment, and looked inquisitively at him"
full in the eyes.
at once.
"With this urgency in mind, I suggested to Frances and Betty that I"
"cross to Calais alone, regardless of the weather, leaving them at Dover"
"till my return. But they would not be left behind, so we all set sail on"
a blustery morning and paid for our temerity with a day of suffering. In
"Calais we posted our letters, having learned that a messenger would leave"
"that same day for Paris, and two days later we returned to Dover."
"Our journey home was made in the rain, Bettina sleeping with her head on"
my shoulder a great part of the way. And I enjoyed the rain even more
than I had enjoyed the sunshine.
"We reached London nearly a week before the king's return, so that nothing"
was known of our journey at court.
CHAPTER XI
"""ALL SUNSHINE MAKES THE DESERT"""
"Whatever faults Whitehall may have had as a place of residence, dulness"
"was not among them. There were balls, games with high stakes, theatres,"
"gossip, scandals, and once in a long while an affair of state to interest"
"us. In order to interest the court thoroughly, an affair of state must"
"have involved the getting of money for the privy purse; that is, for the"
"king's personal use, for out of it the courtesans were fed and gambling"
debts were paid.
"""Why, it's mutiny, sir."""
"""Exactly! You can say you went out under duress."""
"""I never heard of such a thing,"" stormed the skipper. Then, more"
"quietly, ""But I don't seem to have any choice in the matter; do I?"""
"""None whatever."""
"""Tell them to go to hell!"" growled Balt from the open window above"
their head.
"A blasphemous outcry floated up from the launch, while heads protruded"
"from the deck-house openings, the faces white in the slanting glare."
"""Why don't you heave to?"" demanded a voice."
"Peasley stepped to the end of the bridge and called down: ""I can't"
"stop, my good man, they won't allow it, y' know. You'll have to bloody"
"well come aboard yourself."" Then, obedient to his command, the"
"search-light traced an arc through the darkness and died out, leaving"
"the little craft in darkness, save for its dim lantern."
"Unseen by the amazed quartermaster, who was startled out of speech and"
"action, Emerson gripped the Captain's shoulder and whispered his"
"thanks, while the Britisher grumbled under his breath:"
"""Bli' me! Won't that labor crowd be hot? They nearly bashed in my head"
"with that iron spike. Four hundred pounds! My word!"""
The sputter of the craft alongside was now punctuated by such a volley
"of curses that he raised his voice again: ""Belay that chatter, will"
"you? There's a lady aboard."""
XXII
"I muse on all this, and understand that her staying here is somehow"
"connected with her carnal desires, with the fact that Solem is still here."
"How muddled it all is, and how this handsome girl has been spoiled! I saw"
"her not long ago, tall and proud, upright, untouched, walking"
"intentionally close to Solem, yet not replying to his greeting. Did she"
suspect him of complicity in the death of the lawyer and avoid him for
"that reason? Not in the least; she avoided him less than before, even"
"letting him take her letters to the post office, which she had not done"
"previously. But she was unbalanced, a poor thing that had lost her"
"bearings. Whenever she could, she secretly defiled herself with pitch,"
with dung; she sniffed at foulness and was not repelled.
"One day, when Solem swore a needlessly strong oath at a horse that was"
"restless, she looked at him, shivered, and went a deep red. But she"
"mastered herself at once, and asked Josephine:"
"""Isn't that man leaving soon?"""
"""Yes,"" Josephine replied, ""in a few days."""
Though she had seized this opportunity to ask her question with a great
"show of indifference, I am certain it was an important one to her. She"
went away in silence.
"Yes, Miss Torsen stayed, for she was sexually bound to Solem. Solem's"
"despair, Solem's rough passion that she herself had inflamed, his"
arrival of another squadron from Centauri. He found himself busy
readjusting the search pattern to accommodate this new contingent.
He eyed the pattern in the stereo and hoped it was good enough.
*       *       *       *       *
There was the basic aggregate of nine full squadrons spread out flat in
a space lattice that ran back and forth from narrow end to wide end of
the cone of probability. There was one full squadron of roving ships
"that went aimlessly back and forth across the pattern, just to cope"
with the happenstance factor.
One squadron was parked at either end of the search grid as space
"markers, with a computer ship at either end to maintain a constant"
check on their space coordinates. The big search pattern shuttled from
"one end to the other, and if they came back to miss the marker ships,"
they retraced their path so that no space went uncombed.
The infrawave chattered and Space Admiral Stone was calling for
Commodore Theodore Wilson.
"""How're you coming?"""
"Wilson replied, ""We're still at it, Admiral. So far we haven't seen"
"her."""
"""Don't forget, Wilson, there's more lost out there than the woman you"
"want."""
"Ted wanted to snap back angrily, but all he said was, ""You don't mind"
"if I take this search personally, do you, Admiral Stone? I'm not"
heard from the crippled dwarf.
"""It has nothing to do with you,"" she repeated; ""it is a matter of the"
"Gitanos!"""
"But there came up from the bottom of the ravine, the lantern-jawed"
"Sergeant, long, silent, lean, parched as a Manchegan cow whose pasture"
has been burnt up by a summer sun. With one beckoning finger he summoned
"La Giralda apart, and she obeyed him as readily as the boy had obeyed"
"her. They communed a long time together, the old gipsy speaking, the"
coffee-coloured Sergeant listening with his head a little to the side.
At the end of the colloquy Sergeant Cardono went directly up to Rollo
and saluted.
"""Is it permitted for me to speak a word to your Excellency concerning"
"the objects of the expedition?"" he said, with his usual deference."
"""Certainly!"" answered Rollo; ""for me, my mission is a secret one, but I"
"have no instructions against listening."""
The Sergeant bowed his head.
"""Whatever be our mission you will find me do my duty,"" he said; ""and"
"since this cursed plague may interfere with all your plans, it is well"
that you should know what has befallen and what is designed. You will
pardon me for saying that it takes no great prophet to discover that our
"purposes have to do with the movements of the court."""
Rollo glanced at him keenly.
"""Did General Cabrera reveal anything to you before your departure?"" he"
The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its
appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious
"destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of"
them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to
Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.
"""Red spot one mile ahead, altitude forty thousand feet,"" reported"
Brand.
He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far
"below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the"
ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red
firelight.
"Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding"
"wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast"
"crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous"
signal.
"Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the"
scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.
"""We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,"" he said."
"""No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a"
"little."""
Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast
distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles
they knew it extended.
"""We're right on it now,"" called Brand. ""Right on it--we're going over"
"the edge--we're--"""

_SUPERSTITIONS_
"The three of them went to a rather dirty tavern in the same lane,"
and settled themselves by the window. This post was a good point of
"observation for that narrow street, so crowded and so picturesque."
"Workmen went by, and itinerant vendors, women with kerchiefs, half"
"head-dress and half muffler, and with black eyes and expressive faces."
"Opposite was a booth of coloured candies, dried figs strung on a reed,"
and various kinds of sweets.
"A wine-cart passed, and Kennedy made Cæsar observe how decorative it"
"was with its big arm-seat in the middle and its hood above, like a"
prompter’s box.
Giovanni Battista ordered a flask of wine for the three of them. While
"he chatted and drank, friends of his came to greet them. They were men"
"with beards, long hair, and soft hats, of the Garbaldi and Verdi type so"
abundant in Italy.
"Among them were two serious old men; one was a model, a native of"
"Frascati, with the face of a venerable apostle; the other, for contrast,"
"looked like a buffoon and was the possessor of a grotesque nose, long,"
thin at the end and adorned with a red wart.
"Monsieur considered this a great joke, exclaiming:"
"""It is not so much as that! She is but three--to me, always three! Yet,"
"as you say, I might better find her with you than anywhere! A despairing"
"search, my boys!"""
Tommy's eyes were twinkling as he murmured sympathetically:
"""If it's a three-year-old you want, there's a place in Havana called"
"'Casa de Beneficencia Maternidad,' where furtive-eyed damsels leave"
"kiddies at twilight, ring the doorbell, and beat it. You might pick up"
"one there, as a last resort."""
"""But--but,"" Monsieur began to sputter, when I threw an orange at Tommy,"
"explaining to our agitated guest that he was a cut-up devoid of ideas,"
really an intellectual outcast.
"""Well,"" he cried, seeming to exude pleasure, ""I will stay with you a"
"while, eh? Maybe we can teach him something--this cut-upping Tommy of"
"yours!"""
"He had fallen in with our scheme most agreeably, and later Tommy"
confided to me that he was glad we wouldn't have to sit on the old
fellow's head.
"Passing that afternoon beneath Morro Castle, the _Whim_ tacked prettily"
through the entrance of Havana harbor and in another scant two miles
dropped anchor.
"Havana Bay is a dancing sheet of water, as bright as the skies and"
hardly less contagious than the city's laughter. But when one drops
in lockers for a while without speaking. Then he spoke slowly and
deliberately.
"""It strikes me that when I was an officer of the bodyguard, in the"
"service of the late Fernando the Seventh, my right royal namesake (and"
"in some sort predecessor), there was another room used for the private"
stores and pieces of the officers. If I mistake not it was entered by
"that door to the right, but the key appears to be wanting!"""
"He added the last clause, as he watched the frantic efforts of Rollo,"
"who had immediately thrown himself upon the panels, while the Señor was"
in the act of rolling out his long-drawn Castilian elegances of
utterance.
"""Hither, Cardono,"" cried Rollo, ""open me this door! Quick, Sergeant!"""
"""Have a care,"" said the Duke; ""there is powder inside!"""
"But Rollo, now keen on the scent of weapons of defence, would not admit"
"a moment's delay, and the Sergeant, inserting his curiously crooked"
"blade, opened that door as easily as he had done the French window."
Muñoz stepped forward with some small show of eagerness and glanced
within.
"""Yes,"" he said, ""the officers' arms are there, and a liberal allowance"
"of powder."""

[Illustration: FRUIT COMPANY STEAMER AT WHARF]
The United Fruit Company is by far the greatest agricultural enterprise
the world has ever known. Its fruit plantations constitute a farm half a
mile wide and more than seven hundred miles long. All of its farm lands
exceed in area the 1332 square miles which constitute the sovereign
"State of Rhode Island. On these farms are more than 25,000 head of live"
stock. This agricultural empire is traversed by nearly 1000 miles of
railroad. To carry the fruits from the plantations to the seaports there
are employed 100 locomotives and 3000 freight cars. An army of nearly
"40,000 men is employed in this new and mammoth industry. The republics"
of Central America were inland nations before the United Fruit Company
made gardens of the low Caribbean coast lands and created from the
"virgin wilderness such ports as Barrios, Cortez, Limon and Bocas del"
Toro.

I flattered myself that we had all done a neat bit of convincing lying in
a good cause.
"""Odds fish!"" mumbled the king, pulling his chin beard, evidently puzzled."
"""Odds fish!"" exclaimed Frances, mimicking the king's tone of voice and"
"twisting an imaginary beard. ""Some one has been hoaxing Jacob Hall's"
"friend."""
"It was a bold speech, but Frances carried it off splendidly by turning to"
the king and speaking in mock seriousness:--
"""Your Majesty should put a check on Rochester and the wags. It is a shame"
to permit them to work upon the credulity of one who is growing weak in
"mind by reason of age."""
"The country girl had vanquished the terror of the court, and all who had"
"witnessed the battle rejoiced; that is, all save the king and Castlemain."
"She glared at Frances, and her face, usually beautiful despite the lack"
"of youth, became hideous with rage. She was making ready for another"
"attack of words, if not of finger nails, when the duchess interposed,"
saying:--
"""Evidently some one has been hoaxing you, Lady Castlemain. Mistress"
Jennings was not kidnapped Sunday nor any other day. She has been with
"me constantly of late, excepting Sunday after four o'clock, and she has"
"accounted for herself from that time till her return to my closet."""
"Castlemain was whipped out, so she turned the whole matter off with a"
"forced laugh, saying:--"
"from the mill-house, the fate of which must have afforded a striking"
object-lesson to a costive magistracy in trouble about a forced loan.
"""We are undone,"" he cried; ""I am a married man, your Excellency, and"
have not a _maravedi_ to call my own. You had better shoot me out of
"hand, and be done with it. Indeed, we cannot possibly pay."""
"""Go and find your father,"" cried Cabrera; ""he pocketed half of the price"
of Don Ramon Garcia's house. I cannot see my namesake suffer. Tell him
that two thousand _duros_ is the price up till noon. After that it will
"have risen to four thousand, and by three of the afternoon, if the money"
be not paid into the treasury of the only absolute and Catholic
"sovereign (in the present instance my breeches pocket), I shall be"
reluctantly compelled to shoot one dozen of the leading citizens of the
township of Sarria. Let a strong guard accompany this young man till he
"returns from carrying his message."""
"In this way did Cabrera replenish the treasury of his master Don Carlos,"
and with such pleasant argument did he induce reluctant _alcaldes_ to
discover the whereabouts of their strong boxes.
"For a remarkably shrewd man was General Ramon Cabrera, the butcher of"
Tortosa.

HOW TO BECOME A SOLDIER
"""Absolutely."""
"""It would, moreover, not be possible for anyone to enter or leave"
"without your knowledge?""  I suggested."
"""M'sieur understands me perfectly.  Mademoiselle must have fallen to the"
"floor lifeless immediately after I had let you out.  She made no sound,"
"and had Jean not entered with her letters, which the concierge had"
"brought, my poor young mistress might be lying there now."""
The average Frenchwoman of the lower class is always dramatic wherever a
"domestic calamity is concerned, and this worthy bonne was no exception."
She punctuated all her remarks with references to the sacred personages
of the Roman Catholic religion.
"""You haven't searched the room, I suppose?"""
"""No, m'sieur.  Madame gave orders that nothing was to be touched."""
This reply was eminently satisfactory.  I glanced again around the
"place, now dim in the falling twilight, and ordered her to throw back"
the sun-shutters.
"The woman went to the window and opened them, admitting a flood of"
"mellow light, the last crimson of the glorious afterglow.  Up from the"
"boulevard came the dull roar of the traffic, mingling with the sound of"
"distant bells ringing the Ave Maria.  The bonne--an Alsatian, from her"
"accent--crossed herself from force of habit, and retreated towards the"
door.
"""You may go,"" I said.  ""I will remain here until the doctor arrives."""
into a better channel.[23] Such stories are so easy to recognise that
"it would be useless to make a formal list, but I shall make further"
allusion to this in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.
"These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of"
material suitable for normal children. Much might be added in the way
"of detail, and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to"
avoid one class of story more than another; but this care belongs to
another generation of teachers and parents.

At last they had reached the high plateau. A dog barked. The wood
suddenly swarmed with bearded and grotesque forms. They did not
recognize in Francesco the monk who had spent a night in their midst.
"The goatherd had maliciously disappeared, as if to revenge himself for"
his interrupted orisons. With glowering faces they thronged around
"Francesco, a babel of voices shouting questions and threatening the"
intruder.
"He waved them contemptuously aside, and his demeanor seemed to raise"
him in their regards.
At his request to be forthwith conducted into the presence of the
"duke, one pointed to a low building at the edge of the plateau. Wisps"
of smoke curled out of it and vanished into the night.

"his steed to a small plot of pasture, where the grass was tall and"
"untrodden. Then, spent as he was, he requested food and drink, and as"

THE ABBEY OF FARFA
"son found examples the most worthy of imitation, and began to profit"
by them. This anecdote has become incorporated by the Chinese into a
"proverb, which they constantly quote: The Mother of Mentius seeks a"
neighbourhood.”
Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper headings
which catch the eye of children in the streets and appeal so powerfully
to their imagination.
Shakespeare has said:
"Tell me where is Fancy bred,"
"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
"How begot, how nourished?"
"Reply, reply."
It is engendered in the eyes
With gazing fed: and Fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring Fancy's knell.

"If this be true, it is of importance to decide what our children shall"
"look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form some"
idea of the effect upon their imagination.
"Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should"
hasten to say that this influence is very far from being altogether
bad. There are possibilities of romance in street life which may have
just the same kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting
stories. I am indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover (Hon. Sec. of the National
"Organisation of Girls' Clubs), one of the most widely informed people"

CHAPTER VI.
HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECT OF THE STORY.
WE are now coming to the most important part of the question of
"Story-Telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually"
"leading, and that is the Effects of these stories upon the child, apart"
"from the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would"
"in itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling. But, since I"
have urged upon teachers the extreme importance of giving so much time
to the manner of telling and of bestowing so much care on the selection
"of the material, it is right that they should expect some permanent"
"results, or else those who are not satisfied with the mere enjoyment of"
the children will seek other methods of appeal--and it is to them that
I most specially dedicate this chapter.
"I think we are on the threshold of the re-discovery of an old truth,"
"that the Dramatic Presentation is the quickest and surest, because"
it is the only one with which memory plays no tricks. If a thing has
and turned her five cards face upwards.
"""No, Jack, it's because I've won,--three aces and a pair."""
"The Sheriff shot one glance at the girl, keen, searching. Then, without"
"so much as the twitch of an eyelid, he accepted his defeat, took a cigar"
"from his pocket and lit it, the flame of the match revealing no"
"expression other than the nonchalance for which he was noted; then,"
picking up his hat and coat he walked slowly to the door. Here he halted
and wished her a polite good-night--so ceremoniously polite that at any
other time it would have compelled her admiration.
"Pale as death and almost on the point of collapse, the Girl staggered"
"back to the table where the wounded road agent was half-sitting,"
half-lying.
Thrusting her hand now into the stocking from which she had obtained the
"winning, if incriminating, cards, she drew forth those that remained and"
"scattered them in the air, crying out hysterically:"
"""Three aces an' a pair an' a stockin' full o' pictures--but his life"
"belongs to me!"""

"Conscious-stricken at the fraud that she had imposed upon the gambler,"
the Girl lived a lifetime in the moments that followed his departure.
With her face buried in her hands she stood lost in contemplation of her
the dynasty [will come to an end].
"If it is a double foetus, encompassed like an enclosure, the king"
will [subdue ?] the land.
"If it is a double foetus and encompassed like an enclosure, confusion"
"in the land, hostilities [in the country]."
"If it is a double foetus, encompassed like an enclosure, with slits"
"on the body, end of the dynasty, confusion and disturbances in the"
country.
"If it is a double foetus, encompassed like an enclosure, with twisted"
"necks and only one head, the land will remain under one head."
*       *       *       *       *
"If it is a double foetus, the heads enclosed, with eight legs and"
"only one spine, the land will be visited by a destructive storm[38]."
"If it is a double foetus with only one head, the land will be secure,"
"the ruler will prevail against his enemy, peace and prosperity in the"
country[39].
"If it is a double foetus with one head, a double spine, eight feet,"
"two necks and two tails, the king will enlarge his land."
"If it is a double foetus with one head, double spine, two tails and"
"one body, then the land that is ruled by two will be ruled by one."
"If it is a double foetus with only one head and one spine, eight"
"feet, two necks and two tails, the king will enlarge his land."
"""Stand aside,"" Peasley ordered, gruffly; but the other held his ground,"
"saying, quietly:"
"""I warn you. I am desperate."""
"""Shall I stop her, sir?"" the quartermaster asked from the shadows of"
the wheel-house.
"""No!"" Emerson commanded, sharply, and in the glow from the"
"binnacle-light they saw he had drawn his revolver, while on the instant"
"up from the void beneath heaved the massive figure of Big George Balt,"
"a behemoth, more colossal and threatening than ever in the dim light."
"Rumbling curses as he came, he leaped up the pilot-house steps,"
"wrenched open the door, and with one sweep of his hairy paw flung the"
"helmsman from his post, panting,"
"""Keep her going, Cap', or I'll run them down!"""
"""We stood by you, old man,"" Emerson urged; ""you stand by us. They can't"
"make you stop. They can't come aboard."""
"The launch was abreast of them now, and skimming along so close that"
one might have tossed a biscuit aboard of her. For an instant Captain
Peasley hesitated; then Emerson saw the ends of his bristly mustache
rise above an expansive grin as he winked portentously. But his voice
was convincingly loud and wrathful as he replied:
"""What do you mean, sir? I'll have my blooming ship libelled for this."""
"""I'll make good your losses,"" Emerson volunteered, quickly, realizing"
that other ears were open.
"so, never fear. No power on earth could make me take up the old life"
"again."""
The Girl said nothing in reply; instead she put both her arms around his
"neck and remained a long time in his embrace. At last, summoning up all"
"her fortitude she put him resolutely from her, and whispered:"
"""When you are ready, come. You must leave me now."" And with a curt"
command to the Indian she fled back into the darkness.
For an instant the road agent's eyes followed the direction that she had
"taken; then, his spirits rising at the thought that his escape was now"
"well-nigh assured, he turned and plunged down the ravine."
"As a strong David, at the voice of verity,"
"Great Goliah, the pope, he struck down with his sling,"
Restoring again to a Christian liberty
"His land and people, like a most victorious king;"
To his first beauty intending the Church to bring
From ceremonies dead to the living word of the Lord.
This the second act will plenteously record.
"As put into the mouth of the king himself, these other lines are hard to"
beat for deliberate partisan misrepresentation. The king feels himself
about to die.

But now I perceive that sin and wickedness

"outside[65], the inhabitants of the boundary city will become subject"
to the enemy.
"If behind the left ear there are two ears visible on the outside, the"
inhabitants of the boundary city of the enemy will become subject to
you.
"If a foetus has three ears, one on the left side and two on the right"
"side, the angry gods will return to the country."
"If a foetus has three ears, one on the left side and two on the"
"right, the gods will kill within the country."
If within the right ear of a foetus there are three ears with the
"inner sides well formed, the opponent will conclude peace with the"
"king whom he fears, the army of the ruler will dwell in peace with"
him.
If within the left ear of a foetus there are three ears with the
"inner sides well formed, thy ally will become hostile."
If behind each of the two ears there are three ears visible on the
"outside, confusion in the land, the counsel of the land will be"
"discarded, one land after the other will revolt."
If within each of two ears there are three ears visible on the inner
"side, things will go well with the ruler's army."
CHAPTER VI
RETRIBUTION
Beneath the dark cornices of a thicket of wind-stunted pines stood a
"small company of men, looking out into the hastening night. The"
"half-light of evening lay over the scene, rolling wood and valley into"
"a misty mass, while the horizon stood curbed by a belt of heavy"
"thunder-clouds. In the western vault, a vast rent in the wall of gray"
shot out a blaze of translucent gold that slanted like a spear shaft
to a sullen sea.
The walls of Astura shone white and ghostly athwart the plains.
Sea-gulls came screaming to the cliffs. Presently out of the blue
"bosom of an unearthly twilight a vague wind arose. Gusts came,"
"clamored, and died into nothingness. The world seemed to shudder. A"
red sword flashed sudden out of the skies and smote the hills. Thunder
"followed, growling over the world. The lurid crater of Vesuvius poured"
"gold upon the sea, whose hoarse underchant mingled with the fitful"
wind.
A storm came creeping black out of the west. The sea grew dark. The
forests began to weave the twilight into their columned halls. A
sudden gust came clamoring through the woods. The myriad boughs tossed
"and jerked against the sky, while a mysterious gloom of trees rolled"
back against the oncoming night.
"The men upon the hill strained their eyes towards the sea, where the"
"profession.""--Ibid."

"comprehensive views of history were Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, Voltaire,"

"was so cruelly reviled by men who called themselves Christians, that"
"it seemed doubtful if, after such an example, subsequent writers would"
hazard their comfort and happiness by attempting to write philosophic
history. Middleton wrote in 1750.... As long as the theological spirit
"was alive nothing could be effected.""--Ibid."
"4. ""The questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a"
hundred years ago were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds
of years before that.... But the Church had known how to deal with
"intellectual insurgents, from Abelard in the twelfth century down to"
"Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated, and for the"
may be stated that love is but one of the bodily passions that dies with
"it; however, even in some of the stories themselves, this explanation is"
used to clear certain difficulties; however opposed eternal love may be
"to one of the central doctrines of Buddhism, it seems to me that the"
very essence of this story is the belief that love does not die with the
"body, that it lives for ever and ever, through incarnation after"
incarnation. Such a story is the very cry of the agony of humanity.
"'Love is strong as death; many waters cannot quench love;' ay, and love"
"is stronger than death. Not any dogmas of any religion, not any"
"philosophy, nothing in this world, nothing in the next, shall prevent"
him who loves from the certainty of rejoining some time the soul he
loves.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE FOREST OF TIME
'The gate of that forest was Death.'
There was a great forest. It was full of giant trees that grew so high
and were so thick overhead that the sunshine could not get down below.
"And there were huge creepers that ran from tree to tree climbing there,"
"Astura poured boiling pitch upon the heads of the attacking party,"
hurled rocks of huge dimensions down upon them which crushed into a
"mangled mass scores of men, unable to retain the vantage they had"
"gained under the avalanche of arrows, rocks and fire."
In a moment's time the situation was changed.
"Noiselessly as leopards, the duke's men fell upon their rear, raising"
"their war-cry as they leaped from the shadows. Those on the ramparts,"
"forced to grapple with the nearer enemy, abandoned their tasks. The"
"Pisans, profiting by the lull, swarmed over the walls. Taken between"
"two parties, a deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued. Above the din and"
"the roar of the hurricane, of the clashing of arms, above the cries"
"of the wounded, the death-rattle of the dying, sounded the voice of"
the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Onward, my men! Kill and slay!"""
Side by side the duke and Francesco leaped into the thickest of the
"fray, both animated by the same desire to come face to face with the"
"lords of Astura, spurning a lesser enemy."
For a time they seemed doomed to disappointment. Had the Frangipani
been slain?
The zest of the conflict pointed rather to their directing the
defence. Else their mercenaries would have left Astura to its fate.
Suddenly an unearthly voice startled the combatants.
"""Guard, devil, guard!"""
"From 1 to 2¹⁄₂ months, ¹⁄₁₆ dose."
DOGS.
"From ¹⁄₂ to 1 year old, full dose."
"From 3 to 6 months, ¹⁄₂ dose."
"From 1¹⁄₂ to 3 months, ¹⁄₄ dose."
"From 20 to 45 days, ¹⁄₈ dose."
"From 10 to 20 days, ¹⁄₁₆ dose."
THE ART OF PRESCRIBING
The prescription should be as brief and simple as possible. It should be
explicit and clearly written. It may be expressed either in Latin or in
English. The manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
"specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic regulations"
or diet of the patient are sometimes necessary.
Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the following four
representative constituents: (1) The _basis_ or active ingredients. The
practice of conjoining several active medicines has wisely been
"abandoned. Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give"
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat different
"ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are more often effectually controlled"
by the conjunction of a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium
than by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by either
morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving them together. (2)
"The _adjuvant_ is introduced in order to increase, moderate or modify"
the action of the basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure
solubility and ready absorption. (3) A _corrective_ is occasionally
"But now science has learned a new wisdom, to look only at what it can"
"see, to leave vain imaginings to children and idealists, certain always"
that the truth is inconceivably more beautiful than any dream.
"Science with us has gained her freedom, but the soul is still in bonds."
Only in Buddhism has this soul-freedom been partly gained. How beautiful
"this is, how full of great thoughts, how very different to the barren"
"materialism it has often been said to be, I have tried to show."
I believe myself that in this teaching of the laws of righteousness we
"have the grandest conception, the greatest wisdom, the world has known."
I believe that in accepting this conception we are opening to ourselves
"a new world of unimaginable progress, in justice, in charity, in"
"sympathy, and in love."
"I believe that as our minds, when freed from their bonds, have grown"
"more and more rapidly to heights of thought before undreamed of, to"
"truths eternal, to beauty inexpressible, so shall our souls, when freed,"
"as our minds now are, rise to sublimities of which now we have no"
conception.
"Let each man but open his eyes and see, and his own soul shall teach him"
marvellous things.

"ambush, when he pushed it back with a puzzled look. Before a wayside"

figure at orisons. He either had not heard the tramp of Francesco's
"steed, or ignored it on purpose, for not until the latter called to"
"him did he turn, and with much relief Francesco recognized his former"
guide from the camp of the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Where is the camp of the duke?"" he queried curtly, impatient with the"
man's exhibition of secular godliness.
"""Many miles away,"" replied he of the goat's-beard, as he arose and"
kissed a little holly-wood cross that he carried.

"The godly little man flopped again, scraped some dust together with"

uttering the names of sundry saints.
Francesco had come to the end of his patience.

They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically
sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at
"eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering"
such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their
"course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million"
miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander
Stone's night operator.
The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of
the solar system was on.
CHAPTER II
_The Pipe-like Men_
Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day
"(morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in"
space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance
"off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship,"
"which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling"
faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.
"Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no"
larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of
"Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its"
outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks.
"temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual.” To those who"
"wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for their"
encouragement the following lines from Whitcomb Riley:
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN.[39]
"Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,"
When the robbers came to rob him;
"And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,"
The robbers who came to rob him--
"They picked the lock of the palace-gate,"
Seized his jewels and gems of State
"His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,--"
The robbers that came to rob him.
But loud laughed he in the morning red!--
For of what had the robbers robbed him?
"Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,"
"When the robbers came to rob him,--"
They robbed him not of a golden shred
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head--
"“And they're welcome to all things else,” he said,"
When the robbers came to rob him.
"There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a"
"delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things"
"for small children, to be found in our old Nursery Rhymes. I quote from"
the following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the _Nation_.
After speaking on the subject of Fairy Stories being eliminated from
"the school curriculum, the writer adds:"

at once. From the top there is a magnificent view of the city and the
"surrounding plain, of the mountains on the east and the sea on the"

From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for the first time the
red gold of ripe oranges shining amid their dark green leaves in the
"gardens, and rejoiced to think that at last we had reached a somewhat"
"milder climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us."
"The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the schedule was such"
that we did not arrive till late at night. From the car windows we had
"some impressive views of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the"
"solemn campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at midnight,"
and passed through the breach in the walls which has been made for the
"railway, feeling, perhaps even more deeply than is usual, the thrill"
with which all travellers except those who are utterly devoid of
imagination first enter the Eternal City.

This is a vivid and powerful romance of the thirteenth century in the
"times of the great Ghibelline wars, and deals with the fortunes of"
"Francesco Villani, a monk, who has been coerced by his dying father to"
"bind himself to the Church through a mistaken sense of duty, but who"
"loves Ilaria, one of the famous beauties of the Court at Avellino. The"
"excitement, splendor and stir of those days of activity in Rome are"
"told with a vividness and daring, which give a singular fascination to"
the story.

"""José Maria, the Gitano, the prince of brigands!"" murmured La Giralda."
"""Ah,"" said the Sergeant, coolly, ""I have heard of him."""
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
"Not a word more was uttered between the two. La Giralda, for no reason"
"that she would acknowledge even to herself, had conceived an infinite"
"respect for Sergeant Cardono, and was ready to obey him implicitly--a"
fact which shows that our sweet Concha was over-hasty in supposing that
one woman in any circumstances can ever answer for another when there is
a man in the case.
But on this occasion La Giralda's submission was productive of no more
"than a command to go down into the town of San Ildefonso, the white"
"houses of which could clearly be seen a mile or two below, while the"
sergeant betook himself to certain haunts of the gipsy and the brigand
known to him in the fastnesses of the Guadarrama.
Like a dog La Giralda complied. She sharpened a stick with a knife which
"she took from a little concealed sheath in her leathern leggings, and"
with it she proceeded to quicken the donkey's extremely deliberate pace.
"Then with the characteristic cry of the goatherd, she gathered her flock"
together and drove them before her down the deeply-rutted road which led
"from the farmhouse. She had not proceeded far, however, when she"
"1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic"
matter they have been derived by slow change.
"2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either"
a porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.
"3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under"
"pressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them"
"from escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of"
"an ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS."
"4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In"
"these reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,"
reaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred
pounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a
"deafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In"
accounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has
been compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian
"water, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is"
not uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the
exhaustion of gas and oil.
LIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN
"During the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types"
"already present branched widely into new genera and species, and"
new and higher types appeared.
Sponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their
climax.

lamb with all kinds of animals[81] the extent to which the association of
ideas connected with the animals in question is carried.

"the legitimate king for many years, or[84] the king will strengthen"

"If an ewe gives birth to a Mukh-Dul[85], the enemy will carry away"
"the inhabitants of the land, the land will despite its strength go to"
"ruin, the dynasty will be opposed, confusion in the land."
"If an ewe gives birth to a panther, the kingdom of the ruler will"
secure universal sway.
"If an ewe gives birth to a hyena (?), approach of Elam."

Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
"was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent"
by train a distance of twenty-five miles.
When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
"follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,"
especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
"furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,"
"entirely thoracic, 30."
"Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and"
"motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial"
oedema and emphysema.

that held him to his seat.
"""Boat's done for, sir,"" announced one of the would-be crew. Such was"
the case. The explosion of a shell had wrenched her keel and
garboards out of her.
"""Then overboard with that!"" ordered Terence, indicating a Carley"
"life-buoy, which, though scorched by the blast of the shells, was"
still practically intact.
"The Carley life-buoy is a ""new departure"" in life-saving appliances"
on board ships of the Royal Navy. It is a glorified edition of an
"ordinary buoy, but elongated in shape and provided with gratings, and"
capable of being propelled by oars.
Half a dozen bluejackets seized the huge buoy and slung it overboard.
Held by means of a line it floated alongside the cruiser until
Terence and three men clambered into it.
Although the rate of propulsion was not by any means so rapid as that
of a boat the progress of the rescuers was far from slow. More than
once they were splashed by the spray thrown up by a ricochetting
"projectile, as the German gunlayers were gradually correcting their"
"aim, yet unscathed the rescue party came alongside the gradually"
sinking seaplane.

control[55].
"If the foetus lacks a left ear, a god will harken to the prayer of"
"the king, the king will take the land of his enemy, the palace of the"
"enemy will be destroyed, the enemy will be without a counsellor, the"
"cattle of the enemy's country will be diminished, the enemy will lose"
control.

destroyed.
"If the left ear of the foetus is detached, the enemy's stall will be"
destroyed.

or the leaders of the city will leave (it)[57].

brown filiform ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
"and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground, this being the"
form in which it is usually used.

OLEUM ANISI--OIL OF ANISE
A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless or pale yellow, thin and strongly refractive"
"liquid, having the characteristic odor of anise, and a sweetish, mildly"
aromatic taste. Specific gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an
equal volume of alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs"
"and cats, 1 to 5 m."
"ACTIONS.--Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic and carminative. It"
"is used to relieve indigestion and flatulence, to communicate an"
"agreeable flavor to many medicines, and to diminish the griping of"
purgatives. Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.
USES.--The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or alcohol to kill
"fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin; and one drop of the pure"
oil may be placed on the feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice.
"The oil of anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of drugs,"
and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant properties.
Fluffy Reubens winked at the others:
“I don’t see that this chap Anthony Bickersteth’s work is a snap better
than Caroline Baddlesmere’s; and he’s prigged a lot of her ideas----”
"Aubrey turned round to the room, took up a picturesque literary"
"attitude, elbow on mantel, his cheek leaning on his long fingers,"
"legs crossed, essaying to realize the portraits of the thirties, and,"
"rousing from his adoration of himself, he said petulantly:"
"“My dear fluffsome Robbins, I have repeatedly told you that Caroline"
Baddlesmere lacks breadth of view and a man’s humour--to say nothing of
that certain something of subtle atmosphere that is called genius....
You really ought not to give me the trouble of reiterating these simple
truths.... You compel me to feel as blatantly insistent as a bookmaker
on a race-course----”
"He was interrupted by the entrance of the old butler, ushering in"
Bartholomew Doome and Andrew Blotte--Andrew in very much crushed and
"wrinkled evening dress, and looking unutterably shabby, Doome well"
groomed.
Bartholomew Doome laughed:
"“Yes,” said he, “yes, yes--I heard what Aubrey was saying; but Aubrey"
"is a poet, not a critic.”"
Lovegood laughed a funny deep nasal laugh.
But Rippley had turned to the strange figure of Andrew Blotte. He smote
him on the shoulder with strong genial hand:
horizon. Then he pointed with his holly staff to a blue hill that rose
against the eastern sky.
"""How far?"" queried Francesco."
The goatherd was anointing himself with spittle.
"""Each mile in these parts grows more evil,"" he said, tracing the sign"
"of the cross. ""It behooves a Christian to be circumspect!"""
Francesco prodded him with his scabbard.
"""How far?"""
"""Some ten leagues,"" replied the gnome. ""The day is clear, and the"
"place looks nearer than it is!"""
"It occurred to Francesco that there must be some human abode close by,"
"as the goatherd, entirely familiar with the region, would not wander"
too far from habitations of the living. And upon having made known his
"request, the little man preceded him at a lively pace. At a lodge in"
"the forest deeps they halted, and here Francesco and his guide rested"
"during the hot hours of noon, partaking of such food as the liberality"
"of their host, an old anchorite, set before them."
"After men and steed had rested, they set out anew."
"The goatherd's inclination to invoke untold saints, whenever there"
"seemed occasion and whenever there was not, was curbed by a hard line"
"round Francesco's lips, and they plunged into the great silence. A"
"sense of green mystery encompassed them, as they traversed the green"
forest-aisles. The sky seemed to have receded to a greater distance.
"that day, despite the fact that Big George, bruised, ragged, and torn,"
doubled his force of pickets and took personal charge of them.
"That night, under glaring headlines, the evening papers told the story,"
"reporting one fisherman fatally hurt, one striker dead of a gunshot"
"wound, and many others injured."
CHAPTER XVIII
WILLIS MARSH SPRINGS A TRAP
"The ensuing days were strenuous ones for the partners, working as they"
"did, with a crippled force and under constant guard. Riot was in the"
"air, and violence on every side. By the police, whose apathy"
disappeared only when an opportunity occurred of arresting the men they
"were supposed to protect, they were more handicapped than helped. The"
appearance of a fisherman at any point along the water-front became a
sure signal for strife.
"Day by day the feeling on both sides grew stronger, till the non-union"
"men were cemented together in a spirit of bitterest indignation, which"
materially lessened their zeal for work. Every act of violence
"intensified their rage. They armed themselves, in defiance of orders,"
"tossed restraint to the winds, and sought the slightest opportunity of"
wreaking vengeance upon their enemies. Nor were the rioters less
"determined. Authority, after all, is but a hollow shell, which, once"
"broken, is quickly disintegrated. Fierce engagements took place,"
dated between 1520 and 1540) thus late is justified by the fact that he
"is in some ways 'before his time', notably in his rejection of the"
Morality abstractions.]

CHAPTER IV
RISE OF COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
"No great discernment is required to see that, after the appearance of"
"_Johan Johan_, all that was needed for the complete development of"
comedy was the invention of a well-contrived plot. For reasons already
"indicated, Interludes were naturally deficient in this respect. Nor were"
the Moralities and Bible Miracles much better: their length and
"comprehensive themes were against them. There were the Saint Plays, of"
which some still lingered upon the stage; these offered greater
"possibilities. But here, again, originality was limited; the"
"_dénouement_ was more or less a foregone conclusion. Clearly, one of two"
things was wanted: either a man of genius to perceive the need and to
"supply it, or the study of new models outside the field of English"
"drama. The man of genius was not then forthcoming, but by good fortune"
the models were stumbled upon.
"We say stumbled upon, because the absence of tentative predecessors and"
"of anything approaching an eager band of successors, suggests an"
unpreparedness for the discovery when it came. Thus _Calisto and
"Melibaea_ (1530), an imitation of a Spanish comedy of the same name,"
conveyed no meaning. And then sleep descended and brought entire
oblivion.
VIII
HOME ON LEAVE
"""I have several times expressed the thought that in our day the"
"feeling of patriotism is an unnatural, irrational, and harmful"
"feeling, and a cause of a great part of the ills from which mankind"
"is suffering; and that, consequently, this feeling should not be"
"cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the contrary, be"
"suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men."""
(TOLSTOY.)
A change had come over us all. Instead of long spells of dreary silence
"interrupted by outbursts of irritability, by grumbling and by violent"
"quarrels over nothing, there was animated conversations and sometimes"
"even gaiety. Our talk was all about one subject--not about peace, for we"
had abandoned all hope of peace and hardly ever thought of it--but about
"leave. We had been waiting for seventeen months when, without warning, a"
leave allotment was assigned to our unit. About half a dozen men were
going every day and no one knew whose turn would come next. We were full
"of intense excitement and glad expectation, but also of anxiety in case"
something should happen to stop our leave altogether.
I made up my mind to enjoy myself thoroughly. I would see parents and

ANTIMONII ET POTASSII TARTARS--ANTIMONY AND POTASSIUM TARTRATE--TARTAR
EMETIC
"DERIVATION.--Make a white paste with cream of tartar, antimony trioxide"
"and water. Set aside 24 hours, boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize."
"PROPERTIES.--Colorless, transparent crystals of the rhombic system,"
"becoming opaque and white on exposure to the air, or a white granular"
"powder without odor and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable,"
"metallic taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol."
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5 gr.; pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1"
"gr.; dogs, ¹⁄₁₀ to ¹⁄₂ gr. As an emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1"
to 2 gr.
"ACTIONS.--Tartar emetic is a systemic and local emetic, a diaphoretic,"
cardiac and arterial sedative and a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a
"powerful waste producer and stimulates the secretions of the stomach,"
"intestines, salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large doses cause"
"nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic doses are followed by"
"vomiting (in animals that can vomit), serious blood purging, great"
"depression of the circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and"
death. Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.
"Minna--she raved over the judicial murder of this Belgian heroine,"
"who was shot, as was Edith Cavell, for nothing more than assisting"
young Belgians to escape from German-occupied Belgium.
"She witnessed the air-raids of the Allies, when only comforting"
"papers were dropped on Brussels city, but bombs on the German"
aerodromes outside; and she also saw the Germans turn their guns
from the aeroplanes--which soared high out of their reach or skimmed
"below range--on to thickly-inhabited streets of the poorer quarters,"
to teach them to cheer the air-craft of the Allies!
"She beheld--or she was told of--many acts of rapine, considered"
cruelty and unreasoning ferocity on the part of German officials or
soldiers; yet saw or heard of acts and episodes of unlooked-for
"kindness, forbearance and sympathy from the same hated people. Von"
"Giesselin, after all, was a not uncommon type; and as to Minna von"
"Stachelberg, she was a saint of the New Religion, the Service of"
Man.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BOMB IN PORTLAND PLACE
Mrs. Rossiter said to herself in 1915 that she had scarcely known a
"happy day, or even hour, since the War began. In the first place"
Michael had again shown violence of temper with ministers of state
"over the release from prison of ""that"" Miss Warren--""a convict doing"
"a sentence of hard labour."" And then, when he had got her released,"
is the one common to all tropical countries on which Benjamin Kidd laid
an unerring finger when he referred to the unwisdom of longer permitting
the riches of the tropics to “remain undeveloped with resources running
to waste under the management of races of low social efficiency”. The
Panamanian authorities are making apparently sincere endeavors to
attract new settlers of greater efficiency. In proportion to the success
that attends the efforts the future of Panama will be bright.

CHAPTER XVI
THE INDIANS OF PANAMA
While that portion of the Panama territory that lies along the border of
Colombia known as the Darien is rather ill-defined as to area and to
"boundaries, it is known to be rich in timber and is believed to possess"
gold mines of great richness. But it is practically impenetrable by the
white man. Through this country Balboa led his force on his expedition
"to the unknown Pacific, and was followed by the bloodthirsty Pedrarias"
who bred up in the Indians a hatred of the white man that has grown as
the ages passed. No expedition can enter this region even today except
"Pteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age."
Their papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great
numbers from this time on.
"Cephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started"
"into existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the"
"Cambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the"
"allied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,"
"and tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The"
"animal lived in the ""body chamber"" at the larger end, and walled"
off the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of
"the shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the"
body chamber to the closed tip of the cone.
"The seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects"
the most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been
"so numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because"
"of their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,"
that better than any other group of organisms they can be used to
correlate the strata of different regions and to mark by their
slow changes the advance of geological time.
CLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries
"contains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in"
later periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar
regions.
CHAPTER XVII
"as, until I could reach Robat, I had no knowledge at all as to the"
strength and composition of the force that would be at my disposal.
But upon one thing I made up my mind--even at that early stage--I
"would do my utmost to show these Raiders, who were doing us so much"
"harm, that they could not do this with impunity. The lesson once"
"driven home, an endeavour should be made to become friendly with"
"them, to win them back to our side, and, so to speak, appoint them as"
doorkeepers of the Baluchistan frontier; but doorkeepers with their
rifles pointed at our enemies instead of at ourselves.
In the midst of these meditations I found myself stumbling with
"fatigue, so, with a last look at the beauty of the night, I turned"
"indoors, and in a few minutes was sound asleep, and making up for the"
"""whiteness"" of the night before."

"On the third day we made good progress, fate being kind in helping us"
"to avoid the sandy pitfalls which had hitherto been our undoing, and,"
"by nightfall, we found ourselves approaching the post of Mushki-chah."
Here we found the road blocked with a number of camel caravans
CHAPTER XXVI
DEEP ROMANY
The news which Sergeant Cardono had to communicate was indeed fitted to
"shake the strongest nerves. If true, it took away from Rollo at once all"
hope of the success of his mission. He saw himself returning disgraced
"and impotent to the camp of Cabrera, either to be shot out of hand, or"
"worse still, to be sent over the frontier as something too useless and"
feeble to be further employed.
"Briefly, the boy's news as repeated by La Giralda to the Sergeant,"
informed Rollo that though the court was presently at La Granja and many
"courtiers in the village of San Ildefonso, the royal guards through fear"
"and hunger had mutinied and marched back to Madrid, and that the gipsies"
were gathering among the mountains in order to make a night attack upon
the stranded and forsaken court of Spain.
In the sergeant's opinion not a moment was to be lost. The object of the
"hill Gitanos was pure plunder, but they would think nothing of"
"bloodshed, and would doubtless give the whole palace and town over to"
"rapine and pillage. Themselves desperate with hunger and isolation, they"
had resolved to strike a blow which would ring from one end of Spain to
the other.
It was their intention (so the imp said) to kill the Queen-Regent and
"her daughter, to slaughter the ministers and courtiers in attendance, to"
The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he
expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
"being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small"
quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
"cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly."
On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
"the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening"
rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
"day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third"
and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
"accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the"
physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
"rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average"
"of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude"
"was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve"
"corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the"
end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
"up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England"
convalescent.

PLAN
The indexer should decide definitely in his mind just what his
"procedure is to be before actually beginning work. At first, it is well"
"to make the index too full rather than the reverse, as it is easier to"
"cut out than to fill in. Most important of all, he must be sure that"
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood before he attempts to
transcribe the idea. The character of the book to be indexed must be
"carefully considered, taking into account the class of people who will"
"probably consult it, and the lines on which they will probably seek"
information.
Judgment is required in deciding whether it is wise to choose the
exact words of the author or to condense the idea into other words.
"In technical books, the exact wording is sometimes essential, but"
otherwise it is more important to express the _idea_ than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.
Always prefer simple words and expressions to those which are unusual
and cumbersome.
Omit every unessential word.
"When the book being indexed is one written upon a specific subject,"
this main subject should not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
"some reference for which a searcher would look. Ordinarily, the"
Contents covers this point rather than the Index.
Bear in mind particularly the two extremes: the importance of
CHAPTER XVI
THE CAMBRIAN
"THE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,"
"called the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has"
come down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first
"volume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the"
globe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the
"earlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed"
"have suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and"
"have been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the"
pre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate
the formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of
"the Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the"
history of the continents.
"Paleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured"
"by the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions"
of years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms
were very great. It is according to the successive stages in the
advance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five
"systems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the"
"DEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three"
"systems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they"
alike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;
"while the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and"
"""Stop him!"" yelled the commander."
"A dozen men hastened to comply, jolting against each other in their"
"alacrity to pursue the animal, which with marvellous agility had"
gained the extremity of the signal yard-arm.
"Here he perched, hanging on with his hind paws while he tasted each"
coin with his teeth--at first with an expression of hopefulness upon
his features that rapidly changed into one of profound disgust.
Holding the rest of the coins against his chest Mephisto hurled one
on to the sacred precincts of the quarter-deck. It landed in one of
"the compartments of the pay-table, displacing a sovereign, that"
rolled between the staff-paymaster and the assistant-paymaster.
Both officers simultaneously stooped to recover the errant piece of
gold. The result was that their heads met with a thud in spite of the
protection afforded by their peaked caps.
"Several of the men could not conceal a grin. One broke into a laugh,"
and meeting the stern glance of the commander tried to side-track
into a painful cough.
Fortunately for the culprit the commander was inwardly affected by a
"similar complaint, for he, too, saw the humour of the business."
"""Confound you!"" shouted the staff-paymaster, removing his cap and"
"rubbing his bald head. ""Confound you, you brute! Throwing away the"
"money from the public chest!"""
"The only reply from Mephisto was another penny that, thrown with"
the tincture of aconite with other colic mixture; in congestion of the
"bowels or liver, or in congestion of any part, small repeated doses are"
better than large ones. It is also advantageously used in lung
disorders.
AETHER--ETHER--PURE ETHER
"A liquid composed of about 96 per cent, by weight, of absolute ether or"
"ethyl oxide, and about 4 per cent of alcohol containing a little water."
DERIVATION.--Prepared by distillation of alcohol with sulphuric acid.
There are two steps in the production of ether; sulphorvinic acid and
water are formed in the first step. Sulphorvinic acid is then further
acted upon by alcohol. The distillate is freed from water by agitation
with calcium oxide and chloride and subjected to redistillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A transparent, colorless, mobile liquid, having a"
characteristic odor and a burning and sweetish taste. Ether is highly
"volatile and inflammable; its vapor, when mixed with air and ignited,"
"explodes violently. Miscible in all proportions with alcohol,"
"chloroform, benzine, benzol, fixed and volatile oils. Ether is a solvent"
"for fats, oils, alkaloids, resins, gutta percha and guncotton. Upon"
evaporation ether should have no residue. Ether vapor is heavier than
air and consequently etherization should never be done above a light or
fire.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 ms. to 1 dr."
to be blamed as her sins?
"To me the Yellow Peril cry, which is so often revived in some quarters"
"of the Continent, is either a sort of what we call 'guchi,' that is to"
"say, useless repetition of complaint of some unreasonable"
"disappointment, or a perpetuation of wicked instigation and selfish"
"intention. In either case, it is not at all a laudable action; indeed, I"
may say it is wasteful calumny for no material good will come of it
inasmuch as its object can never be achieved from the very condition of
the world. The people who entertain that idea would be doing far better
"service to their country, to the progress of civilisation, to the"
"general cause of humanity, if only they put aside such a silly notion,"
and busy themselves in teaching their fellow country-folks to accustom
themselves to the changed circumstances of the time. It would be a far
"more manly and noble act if they revised their old notions, which in a"
measure may be called prejudice.
"As to ourselves, the Japanese, we shall only be glad if we can enjoy a"
"peaceful and harmonious life in the happy family of the world, as we are"
"determined to do, in spite of all the obstacles which may be laid before"
us.

THE INDO-CHINA QUESTION[1]
INTERVIEW WITH THE BARON SUYEMATSU
and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on
"the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,"
with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of fæcal matter was
"visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal"
contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were
sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured
"in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the"
"belly, after washing with boiled water."
Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median
"basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected"
hypodermically.
"The patient did not rally, and died twelve hours after the"
operation.
"(167*) Wounded at Graspan. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), midway"
"between the umbilicus and pubes; _exit_, 1 inch to the left of"
the fifth lumbar spine. The patient was seen on the third day
"in the following condition: in great pain, expression extremely"
"anxious, vomiting constantly. Pulse 150 running, respirations"
"48. Temperature 100°, sweating freely. Great distension,"
"rigidity, and general tenderness of immobile abdomen. No"
improvement followed the administration of brandy and
"hypodermic injection of strychnine 1/30 grain, and operation"
was deemed hopeless.
In the evening the patient was apparently dying. Face blue and
"sunken and covered with sweat, eyes dull, speechless, pulse"
"imperceptible, restlessness extreme, bowels acting"
"involuntarily, no urine in bladder."
"dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very seldom given internally;"
"hypodermically, one-half this dose. By inhalation, same as given"
internally. It should be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.
"ACTIONS.--It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly dilates the"
arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats; causes a sense of
"fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall of blood pressure due to"
"dilation of the arterioles, lowering of temperature; when the vapor is"
applied direct to muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely
arrests its functional activity; it depresses the nervous system and
unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause death by respiratory failure.
USES.--Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its being inhaled;
"spasmodic asthma, used either internally, hypodermically or best by"
"inhalation; in strychnine poisoning, angina pectoris in tetanus, and as"
a heart stimulant. It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about
recovery from deep chloroform and anesthesia.
ANISUM--ANISE
"ORIGIN.--The anise plant is a native of Egypt and the Levant, but has"
been introduced in various parts of that continent. It is also
cultivated occasionally in the gardens of this country. The fruit is
"abundantly produced in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence it"
"is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central and Southern Russia."
"DESCRIPTION.--Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5 m. m. long; carpels"
usually cohering and attached to a slender pedicel; grayish or
This was written by Erasmus to a member of the University of Leipzig in
December 1520. This one-sided and academic conception of the great
"events, a conception which arose in the study of a recluse bending over"
"his books, did more than anything else to prevent Erasmus from"
understanding the true nature and purport of the Reformation.
CHAPTER XVI
FIRST YEARS OF THE REFORMATION
Beginning of the relations between Erasmus and Luther--
"Archbishop Albert of Mayence, 1517--Progress of the"
Reformation--Luther tries to bring about a _rapprochement_ with
"Erasmus, March 1519--Erasmus keeps aloof; fancies he may yet act"
as a conciliator--His attitude becomes ambiguous--He denies ever
more emphatically all relations with Luther and resolves to
remain a spectator--He is pressed by either camp to take
"sides--Aleander in the Netherlands--The Diet of Worms,"
"1521--Erasmus leaves Louvain to safeguard his freedom, October"
1521
"About the close of 1516, Erasmus received a letter from the librarian"
"and secretary of Frederick, elector of Saxony, George Spalatinus,"
written in the respectful and reverential tone in which the great man
was now approached. 'We all esteem you here most highly; the elector has
all your books in his library and intends to buy everything you may
publish in future.' But the object of Spalatinus's letter was the
"execution of a friend's commission. An Augustinian ecclesiastic, a great"
"They indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,"
"temperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center"
of dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their
"migration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of"
the same system in different countries implies the absence of such
barriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic
fossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine
shells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India
and in the southern extremity of South America. Since such
organisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and
"cannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water"
"connection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the"
antarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered
along the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely
separated countries.
CHAPTER XV
THE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS
THE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of
"the beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have"
"every reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of"
"the oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the"
"solar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of"
"cosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have"
been derived.
"economic principle, that is of the world of nature, of feeling, of"
"passion, as a positive grade of the spiritual process, will probably"
"be counted as Croce's greatest achievement, by those who shall be able"
to look back on his work with an ampler perspective. It is through
"it that his philosophy of the spirit, and in this philosophy, the"
"consciousness of our day, has taken possession of that other world, of"
"that persistent transcendance, which we call nature. In this direction"
"lies, undoubtedly, the future course of the thought of an age, to"
"which, in this afterglow of a great conflagration, all problems seem to"
"gather into the one of the subjection to its better and higher self,"
"the utilization for its purer purposes, of its own cumbersome economic"
"body, of its nature and of its passions."
"[Footnote 1: Filosofia della Pratica, p. 208.]"
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
"Croce's Complete Works form a collection of twenty-eight volumes, in"
"four distinct series, published by Laterza e Figli, of Bari, who are"
"also the publishers of _La Critica_, and of the following collections"
"initiated or directed by Croce: _Scrittori d'Italia, Scrittori"
"Stranieri, Classici della Filosofia Moderna._"
"We give here a full list of the _Opere di Benedetto Croce_, adding to"
"the title of each volume the year of the last available edition, the"
years of their composition having already been indicated in the text:
Champagne contains about 10 per cent of absolute alcohol and carbonic
"acid gas, which acts as a local sedative upon the stomach. Ale, stout"
"and beers contain from 4 to 8 per cent of alcohol, together with bitters"
and malt extracts.
Cider contains 5 to 9 per cent of absolute alcohol. Imported sherry (B.
P.) contains 15 to 20 per cent of absolute alcohol.
"Alcohol is the solvent most commonly employed in pharmacy, dissolving"
"alkaloids, resins, volatile oils, balsams, oleo-resins, tannin, sugar,"
some fats and fixed oils.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 3 to 6 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 3 oz.; dogs,"
2 dr. to 1 oz.
ACTIONS.--Alcohol is a cerebral excitant and finally becomes a
depressant and a narcotic poison.
"It is anesthetic, antiseptic, antiparasitic, rubefacient (if confined),"
"mild astringent, coagulate albumen; a local refrigerant by virtue of its"
"rapid evaporation, unless confined by bandage, oiled silk, etc., when it"
is absorbed by the tissues and causes a sensation of warmth.
In medical doses it is a powerful general stimulant; it is very
"diffusible, and is partly oxidized by the organism, and partly excreted;"
thus alcohol acts as a food.
"Small doses relax the blood vessels, stimulate the gastric glands,"
promote appetite and digestion; lessen the elimination of waste
"products, by preventing rapid tissue waste; causes a feeling of warmth,"
"and temporarily, though slightly, raises the body temperature. It"
"ACTIONS.--Salicylic acid, sodium salicylate and phenyl salicylate are"
"powerful antiseptic, anti-rheumatic, diaphoretic, cardiac depressant,"
antiferment and antipyretic. Salicylic acid is in addition irritant and
"astringent, continued in large doses is apt to derange digestion; best"
to be administered on a full stomach.
"USES.--For acute rheumatism, influenza, strangles and purpura where"
"there is much sloughing; also as a surgical wash, salicylic acid one"
"part, borax one part to thirty or forty parts of water. Salicylic acid"
is a more powerful antiseptic than carbolic acid. Salicylic of soda is
freely antiseptic. Salicylic acid is highly recommended in intestinal
"flatulence, given in two drachm doses with one ounce of aromatic spirits"
"of ammonia. In gastric-flatulence give two drachms in capsule, repeat in"
half hour if necessary.
ACONITUM--ACONITE--MONKSHOOD
"DERIVATION.--Aconite is obtained from the root of aconitum napellus,"
"which grows in Northwestern North America, Europe and Asia in"
"mountainous regions, and cultivated in the United States for its"
beautiful flowers.
"PROPERTIES.--The fresh leaves have a faint narcotic odor, most sensible"
"when they are rubbed. Their taste is at first bitterish and herbaceous,"
"afterwards burning and acrid, with a feeling of numbness and tingling on"
"the inside of the lips, tongue and fauces, which is very durable,"
lasting sometimes many hours. When long chewed they inflame the tongue.
"The dried leaves have a similar taste, but the acrid impression"
THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS. It is to the igneous rocks that
we may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas
"contain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no"
doubt this was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed
the original earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the
"metals have been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even"
the sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and
"other metals, but in this widely diffused condition they are"
wholly useless to man. The concentration which has made them
available is due to the interaction of many agencies. Earth
"movements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust, the intrusion"
"of heated masses, the circulation of underground waters, have all"
cooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins.
"While fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the"
latter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled
"by similar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as"
"limestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes"
"filled with metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and"
zinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous
"aquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case"
of some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New
Mexico.

HISTORICAL GEOLOGY
used internally for bloody urine (haematuria) and for open joints apply
the powdered alum to arrest the flow of joint oil (synovia). For
"catarrhal ophthalmia, after the acute stage, an alum lotion five grains"
to one ounce of water is very serviceable; for granular lids rub with a
crystal of alum. Alum should never be used too strong over the eye as it
seems to have the power of dissolving the cornea; a solution containing
ten grains of alum to the ounce of water may be used in canker of the
ear of dogs; also for leucorrhoea and prolapsus of the rectum; dried
"alum may be used as a caustic whenever a caustic is indicated, but is"
"not recommended for this purpose. For a powerful drying powder,"
especially useful when excessive granulation exists. It causes sloughing
of the dead tissues and is indicated when the use of the knife is
inadmissible.
AMYLIS NITRIS--AMYL NITRITE
"A liquid containing about 80 per cent of amyl nitrite, together with"
variable quantities of undetermined compounds.
DERIVATION.--Obtained through distillation of nitric and amylic alcohol.
Distillate purified by sodium carbonate.
"PROPERTIES.--A clear, yellow or pale yellow liquid, oily, very volatile,"
peculiar and very diffusive ethereal odor and a pungent aromatic taste.
"Insoluble in water, but soluble in all proportions in alcohol, ether and"
chloroform.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 15 ms.;"
which will certainly remain as the most lasting monument raised to the
memory of the poet on this occasion. This troubled peace cannot make
him deviate from the path of his appointed labour any more than the war
"could; in peace as in war, his duty is his daily task, here and to-day,"
and his confidence in the morality and usefulness of that work which is
"his work is as little shaken by the prophets of despair in peace, as"
it was by the messiahs of the promised land who were so loud above the
turmoil of war. He is probably now noting with a smile that the same
"men who talked of the war to end all wars, are now very busy preventing"
"our civilization from dying away; that is, building a peace in the"
"abstract, with programs and words, as they fought a war which was not"
"the war, but a phantasm of their imagination."
"[Footnote 1: _Contributo_, p. 74.]"
II. THE THEORY OF HISTORY
Two meanings of the word history--History as contemporary history--
"History and chronicle--The spirit as history--Philology, and"
philological history--Poetical and rhetorical history--Universal
history--The universality of history: history and philosophy--The
unity of thought--Philosophy as methodology--The positivity of
history--The humanity of history--Distinctions and divisions--The
history of nature.
"There are two meanings to the word history, in English as well as in"
detachment. But for us it is a matter of life and death. Upon its issue
depends the question whether our grandchildren are to live in a happier
"world, or are to exterminate each other by scientific methods, leaving"
perhaps to negroes and Papuans the future destinies of mankind.
APPENDIX
THE CONWAY MEMORIAL LECTURESHIP
"At a general meeting of the South Place Ethical Society, held on October"
"22, 1908, it was resolved, after full discussion, that an effort should"
"be made to establish a series of lectures, to be printed and widely"
"circulated, as a permanent Memorial to Dr. Conway."
Moncure Conway’s untiring zeal for the emancipation of the human mind
"from the thraldom of obsolete or waning beliefs, his pleadings for"
sympathy with the oppressed and for a wider and profounder conception of
"human fraternity than the world has yet reached, claim, it is urged, an"
offering of gratitude more permanent than the eloquent obituary or
reverential service of mourning.
The range of the lectures (of which the thirteenth is published
herewith) must be regulated by the financial support accorded to the
scheme; but it is hoped that sufficient funds will be eventually
forthcoming for the endowment of periodical lectures by distinguished
"public men, to further the cause of social, political, and religious"
"freedom, with which Dr. Conway’s name must ever be associated."

PHILIP:
"All right, the good stuff."
"Philip, I've, er..."
I got something special for you.
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?
I guess I just sort of assumed it.
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.
"Oh, God."
She can be such a pain in the ass.
"Anyway, here's to us."
Cheers.
Philip.
"Seems like it's just you and me left now, Norm, huh?"
"Oh, hey."
I forgot to tell you.

Did your wedding get called off?
He said with his own lips that he wasn't my brother-in-law!
Is that why he's not answering my phone calls?
That's because...
Yoon Jae has a situation right now.
He even insulted me!
Stupid!
He pretended he didn't know me.
He totally dissed dad!
-That wasn't Yoon Jae who did that...!
-Then...
Then who is the person I saw earlier?
And who's the one that acted like he didn't know me?
That was Yoon Jae.

"Not quite as often, but often."
"Let me know if he comes in, will you?"
"Oh, there you are, Alec."
-I thought you had to make a phone call.
"-I did, darling."
Nobody home.
I was just asking John about my compact.
"-You remember, I lost it last night."
"-No, I don't remember."
I think the reward will help.
"It's square and gold-ribbed, isn't it?"
That's it.
"Be an angel, John."
Do your best for me.
"Yes, Miss Lorrison."
"All right, darling, I'm all yours."
"-Good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
"Well, good evening, Mr. Bourne."
-John.
-A table?
"No, I'll go to the bar, John."
"Oh, Mr. Bourne, Miss Lorrison asked about you."
Isabel Lorrison?
I didn't know she was in town.
She's in the Candle Room with Mr. Dawning.

You can't back out now.

Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.

Okay.
"Hey, how about Diana Krall?"
"Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD."
Do you mind bringing it back to him?
Not at all.
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.
No problem.
"Hey, this is a cool, little CD player."
"Oh, thanks. lt was a gift from your-- lt was a gift."
Perfect.
is there anything else Charlie left behind?
Just me.
My brother's a fool.
No argument here.
-That is a very effective negligée.
-Thank you.
-Was it a gift?
-No.
"-As a matter of fact, I bought it myself."
"-Oh, good."
-How long ago?
-What?
"Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it."
"Alan, don't go there."
"Oh, I wasn't going anywhere."
It's just that--
-Nothing.
More kissing.
"-Okay, okay."
What exactly is bothering you?
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
- Dr Tremaine at the Meredith Hospital.
"We should talk to him, see if he remembers Crowley."
If he knows what happened to him.
The Meredith's not far from here.
Why don't you go?
Are you sure?
"Don't worry, I'll look after her."
(Rings bell)
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a Dr Tremaine.
I'm afraid Dr Tremaine no longer works here.
"- The hospital's being shut down, I'm sorry."
- I...
I...
"Sorry, Mr...?"

- I'll get some lemonade for you!
"- No, I don't want it!"
"Don't be silly, Mimì."
"Drink some, it'll do you good."
"- Here's a wet handkerchief, is that better?"
- Yes.
"I'm sorry if I made you mad, it's all my fault."
- Does your tummy hurt?
- A bit.
"- Does it really, really hurt?"
"- And if I give you a little kiss, will it still hurt?"
- I don't know.
"Shall we try, then?"
"Kids, come on, cut it out!"
Here's your lemonade.
"- No, I don't want it!"
- Come on.
- You don't want it?
- Don't be silly now.

"Sean called you ""Hanna Banana."""
I'll get that for you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- I'm looking for Mrs. Marin.
- Come on in.
"She's, uh, in the kitchen with Hanna."
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
"Well, I'll say!"
Look how red he is.
"I think he needs a new coat of poly, man."
"- Are you sick, buddy?"
- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
- Hey!
What are you doin'?
- It's OK.
"You can trust me, right?"
"I trust you, all right."
It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm...
I trust him.
"- Come on, let's take a drive."
- A drive?
"Yeah, a drive."
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?
Ah...
No.
"No, we don't."
"Hey, Stickers!"
You comin' or what?
Mm-hm!
- And you thought he was gonna run.
"- Hey, can you believe it, man?"
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!
That's so too much!
"OK, you got me out here."
Where are we goin'?
I don't know.
USE YOUR PHONE?
NOT FOR PUBLICATION.
HELLO?
ED?
YEAH.
THE JANITOR.
"IF THAT OLD BOY DID IT,"
I'LL SIT ON THE HOT SEAT FOR HIM.
KEEP MEADE ON IT.
I'M GONNA GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP.
YOUR PIN-UPS?
YEAH.
ALL VERY MURDERED.
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE POINTS
OF COMPARISON WITH THIS FELTON CASE.
"LOOK FOR A YOUNG GUY, BURT."
NOW YOU'RE GUESSING.
PRE-MEDITATED MURDER
"BY A PSYCHO, AND NOT HIS FIRST."
HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANY FINGERPRINTS.
SO HE WORE GLOVES.
"ANYONE WHO LEAVES FINGERPRINTS NOWADAYS,"
"EVEN ON HIS FIRST HOMICIDE, CAN'T EVEN READ!"
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH STUFF IS WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED
FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POTENTIAL LAWBREAKERS?
TAKE THE SO-CALLED COMIC BOOKS.
"SOLD TO KIDS OF ALL AGES, IN DRUGSTORES AND-"
WHY DO YOU SAY THIS KILLER IS YOUNG?
THE LIPSTICK BIT.
THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THAT.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO-
"I KNOW, I KNOW."
"Condom in the eye, Waterfalls."
She's a classic.
She's a cla...
She's still around.
He has no idea.
He knows.
"No, that's okay if you don't know who Rihanna is, Adam."
"No, I know..."
I want to go to the concert.
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.
I haven't seen a concert in forever.
"Last concert I went to was that Green Day cover band, the Basket Cases."
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool.
We got high.
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.
- You guys want one?
- Yes!
I would love a Molsons.
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.
I'm gonna go sing some Rihanna right now.
That's how much I...
I love her and know who she is.
- Right.
- Excited.
Do... what do you think?
Poker Face.
That's a hit of her's.
One word or two words?
- I don't know.
There's Tore back in his home!
Absolutely incredible!
In all my days!
Here we get a wonderful throw from a responsible champion!
It's absolutely fantastic.
It's a triumph for Stian Hermansen!
For a wonderful final stage.
- Look at him.
- He's hungry.
This was delightful.
It was an exceptionally tough looking game.
But we have a boy who refused to give up.
And that on the touchline proves to be a champion of responsibility.
- Brilliant.
- Tore is where he should be.
"And you can finally sleep, Stian, with a clear conscience."
- You're good at taking care of Tore.
- Yes very.
"Goodnight, Stian."

"No, thank you."
I'll do that.
I could probably get Miss Brody to come by.

She says you've written to her.

I think you know very well.
Hello?
It's me.
"Claire, hello."
"Yeah, I'm here."
Is Tracey there?
"Yeah, sure."
You want to talk to her?
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.
"I know, she told me."
"Um, Tracey's asleep."
She's in bed.
Already?
Is she okay?
What's wrong?
She waited for you to call all day.
She's drawing things I don't understand and waking up at night.
"No, she's not okay."
Is there anything I can do?
"Let's talk about this another time, okay?"
I'll tell her you called.
Okay.
Nathan.
Nathan!
Nathan.
"Listen, I came to apologize for this morning."
I was a little heavy-handed and I wanted to apologize.
I have something to show you not far from here.
"Nathan, wait."
Listen.

I'm goin'!
Ooh.
I'm goin'!
"Hey, you guys... what do you say I propose a toast?"
Come on.
Oh... go away.

"Shake it up, take a sip, and wish for what you want most in the world."
Okay.
I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Yeah.
Oh!

"Okay, shake it up, Sport."
Shake it up.
"I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripkin, Jr."
"Oh, yeah!"
And get filthy rich doing it.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Shake it, Harriet."
I want to see the whole world and I want to write down everything.
"Harriet, slow down."
That's very impressive.
Harriet?
I'm goin'!
"That's good, Harriet."
"That's very pretty, isn't it, Janie?"
"Yes, I like it."
Got you!
"Hey, wait up."
"Everybody, hello!"
- Holy crap.
I knew it was you.
I haven't seen you in years.
"Hey-Hey-Hey, Frankie, it's me."
Bobby Thunderson.
- Yes.
Yes.
"Yes, Bobby."
- Look at you!
You... really let yourself go.
"Oh-Oh, are you trying to get back into fighting form?"
"No, I'm actually, uh, teaching my daughter some self-defense."
Holy...
"Holy shit, man."
I'm training my daughter too.
"Hey, what do you know?"
"Hey, look at her."
Look at her over there.
"Look, look, look."
Oh!
Amazing.
"Hey, she's pretty too, huh?"
"Like her old man, huh?"
"- Well, it's really nice seeing you, Bob."
- Yeah.
"Hey, don't listen to everything this guy tells you."
You don't wanna get knocked out in the first round.
"Oh, my God, that's an annoying sound he makes."
- Ass... hole.
"- Yeah, asshole."
"Okay, don't listen to anything he says."
He's a real creep.
Come here.
And... you're married.
I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.
It's not really enough to build a relationship on.
"Oh, we gotta talk."
- You gotta show me your tricks.
Please.
- I tried that.
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
"You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man."
"Oh, take a car wash, hippie."
"Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!"
Whoo!
That's your color!

- Mmm.
You smokin' hot!
There he is.
"Oh, my gosh!"
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
- Doc?
Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.
"No, no, no, no, it's true!"
He's a real racing legend.
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Fabulous?
I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.
"I mean, have you ever seen him race?"
"No, but I wish I could have."
They say he was amazing!

"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.

"Get in the car, warm up."
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.
Everybody in this town is looking at me like I'm insane.
You know why?
"Denise and all the others, they don't know, John."
I do.
I don't think you're crazy.
Okay?
"You talked to him too, John."
You know...
I've been lying awake at night.
I feel... like I'm sleeping... but I'm awake.
That's when I hear him.
"And lately, when I hear him... all at once..."
I understand.
Everything.
"John, doyou remember the last time you were happy?"
It's real.
These things are real.
I want you to be happy.
Yeah?
You must return to him.
"-Father, I..."
I don't want to be parted from you.
"-No need to, my dear."
"Here, wear this."
It will keep us in mind of one another.
Remember to tell no one that you've seen me yet.
-Monitor?
-My dear Doctor.
-I can't thank you enough.
-There is no need.
"You, too, Tegan."
"You, too."
-Where are the others?
-Adric and Nyssa went to look for the Master.
What?
They should know better than that.
There's been enough unnecessary deaths as it is.
-What deaths?
-The murder of innocent Logopolitans.
And the murder of innocent Earth people.
-Earth people?
-Yes.
-Aunty Vanessa?
-Yes.
"I'm so sorry, Tegan."
I'm so sorry.
The Master is already at work on Logopolis.
I'm going to stop him if it's the last thing I do.
Nyssa!
-Did you find him?
-No.
-What you wanna know;
"Oh, just how he's been, what he's been doing."
"Oh, same as always."
Brock's been having a good time for Brock.
What you doing;
-Where'd this come from;
-l've been saving it.
"Why don't you ask me some more questions, Sarah Beth;"
-About what;
-About her.
Ain't you curious about your mother;
You never think of her;
-What for;
-She's your mother.
I don't know who she is.
Don't you ever wonder why she's never come to see you;
-You always say good things about her.
-You always stuff your ears when I did.
She gave up a lot when she went away and she hasn't got much left now.
How about Papa;
Has he got anything left;
-He's got you.
-He's got Brock.
Yeah.
Brock.

You're in room 22.
"Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?"
"Very nice stay, Mr. Fawlty."
"Ah, glad you enjoyed it."
"Polly, would you get Mr. Firkin's bill, please?"
When will we see you again?
"Oh, not for a few weeks."
"You're not by any chance a betting man, Mr. Fawlty?"
"Er... well, I used to be."
Only there's a very nice little filly running at Exeter this afternoon.

Ah.

-Tweedles.
-Alice.
"-How do you do, again?"
-Where's the rabbit?
How is it you're being so great big?
"She ain't great big, this is how she normal is."
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.
"No, she drank the pishsalver to get through the door, recall it?"
"Oh, yeah."
-Where's the rabbit?
-BOTH:
Over theres.
-MALLY:
What are you doing here?
-I'm rescuing the Hatter.

Help me find it.
"I don't take orders from big, clumsy, galumphing..."
Shoo!
"-What is it, McTwisp?"
-I know where the sword is.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
The sword's hidden inside.
"Be careful, Alice."
I know that smell.
(SNORING)
I'm not going in there.
Look what that thing did to my arm.
"Dear, oh, dear."
Why haven't you mentioned this?
It wasn't this bad before.
Got one.
I also have infinity!
"Ah, stealing work supplies-- classic move."
Supply closet's overstocked.

"I won't pay him, even ifyou beg."
"Mr. Weng, let me keep my word and pay him what I promised."
Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.
Go to hell!
Ifyou hadn't worked for my father for so long...
I'd have kicked the shit out ofyou!
Who is he?

"What, you think I'm gonna tell on you?"
"Luke, Luke, look at me, look at me."
"I don't care how many people you've killed, okay?"
"As long as it's not me, and as long as it's not Paul."
"Now come on, cut us free."
Have you enjoyed what you've seen?
I hope you're satisfied!
I know...
I know I let you down.
I should have stepped in when Chris went for you but this...
You could have talked to me.
I'd listened.
What is it?
I saved him.
Cut him down.
Got eaten by a ferret.
That's it.
What about your car history?
"My first was a Ford Anglia, now immortalised by Harry Potter."
Sloping back window.
Two-tone grey.
It was my mother's.
"When I got my first job, I bought it from her."
"I was 21, 22."

Yeah.
A fantastic car!
It WAS fantastic.
Fulvias are a pretty car.
What was it like?
Red and chrome.

It took a bit of driving.
Wooden steering wheel. 1973.
Beautiful things.

"It's fabulous, but what a pity about the radiator."
"And the midnight screening of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" at the Cinedome."
I can't.
I have a curfew... at 11:00.
So?
"So if I break it, my folks will ground me for a month."
"Yeah, parents."
Terrifying.
When's your curfew?
I don't have one.
"Your parents just let you stay out all night, don't they?"
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
Seriously?
"Yeah, we got a pretty sweet setup at the Pines."
The motel?
"HBO, magic fingers, free ice -- it's great."
Yeah.
I guess.
What?
"I do whatever I want, whenever I want."
It's perfect.
"Yeah, but... don't you miss your dad?"
Yo!

"No,that's perfect."
Hmm?

"A $60 Brazilian wax and he's grossed out, but yet Neosporin and scabs are apparently really enticing."
"Baby,I would do you if you had Bella's mole."
I just don't like it when you mess with yourself.
"You guys,you have to come tonight."
You have to.
Johnny's got a gig.
"And you're thinking if he meets your friends,he'll dump you."
"No,I'm thinking it'll make him happy and I want to be supportive."

"Well, promise me you'll never go away again."
Mama's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
"Hey, is that a big-boy tooth I see in there?"
"I twisted it 134 times, and then it came out during all-school assembly."
Oh.
Hm.
- What did the tooth fairy bring you?
"- A bow and arrow, a new pair of Converse, $1.50 and a Monster Flashlight."
- All under your pillow?
"- Well, I got the best tooth fairy in town."
Sounds like it.
Pour your own.
How did you get all that stuff under his pillow?

"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."

You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
It was fun.
Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.

"Hey, stella!"
You quit that howling down there and go to bed!
"-Eunice, I want my girl down here!"
-You shut up!
-You're gonna get the Iaw on you.

"Of course, it's just that--"
"Okay, look, mum, what's happening with the appeal?"
"Well, Mr. Irving filed it--"
Yeah.
He said likely another 6 to 8 weeks.
"Mum, this is not going to work!"
It's not going to work!
I'm getting light here.
"I mean, it's like $100 U.S. a night."
"I mean, I just can't afford it."

"I'm fine, thanks to you."
"Hey, Ryan."
"Sorry I was all, ""Oh, my God,"" because usually, I'm very good in a crisis."
But I started thinking about if anything happened to you.
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay.
We're both okay.
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.
We might encounter all sorts of crises when we're away together at college or--

"What is it, for God's sake?"
"Oh, my little fish!"
My honey!
I've missed you so much!
You've grown so big!
You know what I brought you?
There's a basket under your pillow...
"Grandma, why have you got such a big nose?"
Why big?
A regular nose.
I'm big and my nose is big.
It's interesting...
"The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left."
How did you like your granddaughter?
She's grown up!
They grow so fast.
"- Mom, get away."
- I'll show you 'get away'!
"Don't yell, I beg you!"
"- Yes sir, right away!"
"Back so soon, you're not dumb this time!"

Did he hide it there?
Not here...!
To hell with you...!
Fat Pig!
"- Boss, he calls you Fat Pig!"
- You want us to beat him up?
No need!
"I'll help him to this drink, and he'll curse no more."
There's no poison!

What the hell do you want?
Want some water?
Alright?
Feeling better?
It's poison!
Damn it!

"What are you doing, Angie?"
I'm getting ready for bed.
Don't you miss me?
"Enrique, please not now, I'm tired."
"Yeah, what you tired from?"
Life.
"Life, huh?"
I thought you were tired from going
With that new boyfriend of yours.
What are you talking about?
I don't got no boyfriend.
No?
No...
"what are you, deaf?"
"Don't lie to me, Angie."
I ain't fucking stupid.
"Look, I don't expect anybody to wait three years."
That ain't natural.
I was up north.
You had to do what you had to do.
But I'm home now.
I don't want to see no dudes.
I don't want to smell it.
That's it.
"If you want me, it can only be me."
Okay.
"You know I missed you, Enrique."
You sure?
"Of course, stupid."
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This may hurt a bit.

Sit down.
I need money.
"I got into some trouble with some guys tonight, and, uh, they say that if I don't pay them tonight, I..."
- We have to call the police.
"- No, don't."
"Sandy, the police won't, just..."
It's better if...
I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.
- No...
"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"
"Sandy, I'm scared, I am scared,"
- and I am begging you for money...
- How much?
- A grand.
- $1000?
Might be kind of awkward.
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C. But there'll be a lot of single guys.
So there will be plenty of chances for me to be awkward.
"Don't worry, I'll be there."
I'll talk you through it.
[PLATES SHATTERING]
"Okay, gotta go."
"Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates."
Maybe I'll see you there.
You're busy.
I shouldn't have called.
You called me.
"- Yup, good."
- Bye.
KEITH [ON TV]:

"Pretend I'm a girl, okay?"
I mean  pretend I'm her.
Amanda.
He's into me.
Awesome.
I knew it.

It's totally clear to me now.
He's Watts.
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson was Watts.
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
"Of course, my son."
Congratulations my dear!
"Dad, you really have a good taste."
Another one?
"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"
.
I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.
"Come on Ara, you've already pre-judged the person."
But it's true!
"I'm right, am I not?"
Right?
I'll just get back at you.
"Oh my, will you fix that quickly?"
"Make it fast, come on!"
-Hey here!
-Come on!

"Doc, hold it!"
"Seriously, your driving's incredible!"
- Wonderful.
"Now, go away."
"- Hey, I mean it."
You've still got it!
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.
"I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same."
We are not the same!
Understand?
"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
You people haven't heard the last of this.
-Good night.
-Night.
KELLY:

There's an adversarial relationship between DA's and detectives.
I accept that.
But when I asked you to do the supplementals...

I thought it's okay we work together.
"I thought-- lt's working out great, okay?"
Just seeing you around here...
"... takinganinterestinpeople,doing  your job. lt's great seeing you."

"Oh, yeah."
lnteresting-looking dog you got there.
No.
(Clinking) Think!
Bob's been picking her up all week.
She's been humming stupid songs all around the house.
(Grunts) Last night she came home with green glitter in her hair.
Oh.
Stop it!
"That's right, Sue."
Mom's still in the play.
(Gasps)
What?
!
"You know, when you said lunch and bowling,"
I didn't realize you could do it all in one awesome place.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
"Hey, you're a pretty good bowler, too, you know?"
What did you end up with?
39.
39.
That's pretty good for a 7-year-old.
"No, I'm 10."
Oh.
"Well, you should be better then."
(Brakes squeal)
Okay.
Time for you to take the wheel.
(Shifts gears) What?
"Well, you gotta learn to drive some time, don't ya?"
"Um, don't I have to be 16?"
(Chuckles) Who says?
The state does.
I don't have a license.
Thank you.
-It sounds amazing.
-Thanks.
-I'll get the rest this week.
"-Yeah, no problem."
Good night.
Hello?
Yeah.
It's lan in the penthouse.
We need another bottle of Chateau Marmont.
Sorry.
Dom Perignon.
Cheers.
Thanks.
I think it's more comfortable inside.
I think it's one of the best records I've done.
I think it's the best record you've done too.
"I didn't say ""the best."""
"-She said the best, didn't she?"
"-I thought she said ""the last."""
You see?
You saved the best for last.
I know it's not the last.
"No, don't go."
Don't go.
-You should get some sleep.
"-No, we never sleep."
Why have you got your clothes on?
-What are you talking about?
-You look so much better with them off.
Come here.
We've been entertaining you for a while so why don't you entertain us?
I got that part for your sewing machine.
So?
You said you were gonna do that for a month.
"And then, you finally did it."
Ha ha.
Big favor.
- See you later.
"- Hey, Mag, wait."
"Maggie, wait."
"I don't want you to leave like this, all angry."
"I'm not angry, I just want to know what's up with you."
It's just that I...
I don't know what I'm doing with my drawings.
"David said some shit, yesterday-- you know what, babe?"
You know what?
"I'll get the eggs, okay?"
- Okay?
- Really?
Yeah.
"I'll scramble them real nice, like you like them-- with spinach in them-- mm-mmm."
- Okay?
- Okay.
I'll even get the beads.
Eddie:
Benny Moré?
Tito:
Sí.
Eddie:
No hay problema.
"Viejo, you know she ain't gonna pay you, right?"
What do you care?
I mean she's been coming in here for 12 years.
"Oh, she's about the same, thanks."
She appreciated your sending over that custard.
"Oh, excuse me, please."
Excuse me.
-That one seems superior to the others.
-Does he?
-I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
-His mother's sick.
-Is he married?
-No.
-Is he a wolf?
"-Why, BIanche."
"-well, no, I don't think he would be."
-What does he do?
He's on the Precision Bench in the Spare Parts Department.
The plant that stanley travels for.
-Is that something much?
-No.
stanley's the only one in his crowd likely to get any work.
"Hey, BIanche, you're standing in the light."
Am I?
Gracious.
You ought to see their wives.
"Oh, I can imagine."
"Big, beefy things, I suppose."
-Do you know that one upstairs?
"-Oh, yes."
"well, one night...."
And the pIaster--!
"Hey, you hens!"
-Cut out that cackling in there.
-You can't hear us.
"Yeah, yeah, it's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Can we talk about this on Monday?
"No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
[Inhales deeply]
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah!"
Holla at your boy!
[Cheers and applause]
"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.

"Now, if you come back to this town,"
I'll know it.
And I'll get you.
Understand?
"(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, sir."
"Oh, I won't come back to this town, honest."
"As a matter of fact, I'm going home today."
Tout de suite.
"Here, let me..."
Let me show you.
"You see, here's my... my fare, $26.40, to Blitzen, Washington."
"Oh, man."
"Oh, be careful, bleeding."
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
I'm going to get the very first train home.
"I swear, honest, so..."
"So, goodbye."
Au revoir.
Remember me to the little woman.
(TITTERING)
"(STUTTERING) Goodbye, man."

Good luck walking that one off.
"Noah, buddy."
Hey.
Can you hear us?
"Man, you think he knows we're here?"
"Well, I hope so."
You know how much I hate doing nice things for people if no one sees.
Oh.
Hey.
I put that there.
He stole my wink.
Every time.
"Well, I guess I better do it again."
Whoa.
Hey.
Ah...
"Well, if you want to get credit, man, let's sign his cast and get up out of here."
"Ooh, ooh."
You know what we should do?
"We should sign it all over, with different dates, and then he'll think we came back a bunch of times."
What?
"Oh, hi."
Who are you?
Hey.
"Um, we're Noah's friends, Ben and Fitz."
- We came a really long way to visit.
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, that is so sweet and thoughtful."
It is.
Isn't it?
I'm fine.
"Grey, what are you doing?"
"If you sleep with me, you lunch with me."
New rule.
"You let interns sit with you at lunch, dr."
Sloan?
That is so cool.
"Oh, you want to go halfsies with me on that cookie?"
"Uh, what are you gonna trade me for it, huh?"
"You guys, they have Tater Tots!"
I have to go.
Mark.
Mrs. Shepherd.
- You've been avoiding me.
- What?
No.
You have that same guilty look on your face as you did when you were 10 years old.
And you put Derek's favorite frog into the microwave.
"I never pressed ""Start""."
What's going on?
I'm sleeping with her.
"Oh, Mark!"
Not again.
- How could you?
"- No, no."
"No, not Meredith."
"God, no."
Meredith's little sister.
Which one is she?
"The, uh, the... one with the juice box."
Are my new organs here yet?
"Mm, not yet."
"-You're right, that's Pop talking!"
-They risk their lives for their countyy.
-Countyy isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college andjoin the army!
I did.
I've enlisted in the Marines.
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.
I didn't want it.
Come on!

"Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!"
Go and show Carlo the tyee.
Nice.
Break your father's heart on his birthday.
"That's swell, Mike."
Congratulations.
Don't encourage him!
Get me a drink.
Go on!
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.
Many times he and I have talked about your future.
You've talked to my father about my future?
-My future.
"-Mikey, he has high hopes for you."
-I have my own plans for my future.
- No.
"You're doing the right thing, man."
- Send a postcard?
- Sure.
Call me.
Fly's down.
Honey.
Michael's coming over.
- You told him I was here?
- He knew.
"Come on, Mom."
"Jenna, sweetheart, look, I know."
"I know it hurts like hell and I am sorry, I really am."
"But you know, two days ago you told me these things happen..."
"You and Daddy have been together 30 years, Mom."
We aren't even married yet and he's already cheating on me.
I know.
I know.
"And I really don't need you to defend him right now, okay?"
I'm not.
There's nothing to defend.
It's despicable.
He did an awful thing.
"It's not an awful thing, Mom."
It's an unforgivable thing.
Unforgivable?
What do you want?
- I just want to talk to you!
- Get out of here!
It's over!
- Jenna?
- You hear me?
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.
- Thank you.
"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?
"Okay, I'll talk to you later."
- Nothing.
- Me neither.
Tapia Park's just over the hill.
Let's check that out.
There it is.

"- Well, that baby food is poisoned."

Can't you see it's all wrong?
You're my girlfriend!
And you're my best friend.
"- Tony, I love her."
"- No, you don't."
"OK, maybe I don't."
He loves Cassie.
And you love me.
That works.
- We work.
- Why now?
It's too late.
"It's always been there, Michelle."
It just took a while.
I need you.
You can't have her.
It's wrong.
It's wrong.
That's all I'm trying to say.

"Pilaf-sama, the boat's taking on water."
So row with all you've got.
"One, two."
"Pilaf-sama, it's no use."
"Okay, okay."
Come to the front.
Pilaf-sama...
"Don't cry, Mai..."
Easy for you to say.
"Don't cry, Siu."
"If we can just get the Dragon Balls, we can do whatever we want."
But we didn't even see them.
Are the seven Dragon Balls really even there?
"Mai, trust me."
They're on that ship.
P-Pilaf-sama.
Huh?
What?
Let's get out of here.
"How'd you like that, you dumb shark?"

"Pilaf-sama, we made it."
I thought I was going to die...
You two have done well.
Hey.
What're you doing?
Hey.
Climb this.
"You have my thanks, children."
What were you doing down there?
We're here for the Dra drama serial we're shooting.
Where're your cameras?
"That's kinda what I'm doin' here, too."
Huh.
Fuckin' takin' care of business.

Everything's all right.
"Get your clothes, and let's get outta here."
All right...
That's where we stand.
I don't know what we're gonna get here... good.
"Hiya, Dalton."
"It's uh, pretty, uh, gruesome in there, isn't it?"
"Wait, hold it, Victor, hold it."
"Listen, can we just come in and take a quick look around."
Now you know the rules.
Nobody in there until 'til the ma gets here.
Not anymore.
You know why;
"Maybe you better not talk about it now, Doc."
Got to-- l'll tell you why.
Lutie.
I can say it now.
Lutie.
"Wouldn't let anybody speak her name, would you, Jim;"
But you gotta humor me.
"Last wish, you know."
All Lutie needed was a little help from you.
She had better coming than she got.
She never forgot her children.
She was all right.
And you sent her away twice.
Your fault.
"That's right, yours."
"People don't tell you that much, do they, Jim;"
Jim.
Jim.
You hear me;
"Yes, Doc. I hear you."
"You, you'll never change."
You still got that same look in your eyes.
"No, you'll never change."
The Doc.
"Out of his head, I guess, Jim."
"No, he was right."
Just right.
"He's gone, gentlemen."
"Colonel Brewton, I had no idea."
-Are you sure;
- Hi.
"- Hi, dear."
"- Hi, Emily."
"- Hi, Jer."
Come on in.
"Oh, hi, Howard."
Bob.
Happy birthday.
Here.
It's a cake.
"Well, I can only eat it if it's made out of water."
"Well, it almost is."
"Uh, let's see."
"It's made out of, your lettuce, bean sprouts, your ground carrots."
Sounds delicious.
"Well, we don't know, Bob."
Nobody's ever eaten one.
- Let me put it in the kitchen.
"- Yeah, and I'll make us all a drink."
"Oh, Thank you, Howard."
"Gee, if I'd have known it was gonna be formal, I'd have worn my cummerbund."
Go ahead.
Open her right up.
- What do you guys want to drink?
"- Scotch for me, Howard."
"- Uh, I'll have a glass of wine."
- Me too.
"- Uh, Bob?"
- What the heck?
It's my birthday.
Uh-
"Give me a glass of water, and... drop a ice cube in it for flavor."
"Staff meeting, everybody!"
"Snake, Robot, podium duty."
Hey.

"Got a staff meeting, you guys."
"Come on, let's go."
"Now, where is that..."
Oh.
"Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?"
"-How're you doin', Rex?"
-Were you scared?
Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
"I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it."
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
"Oh, hi, Bo."
Hi.
"I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock."
"Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'."
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
"Oh, yeah!"
"Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away."
-Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
"-Come on, come on."
Smaller toys up front.
"Hey, Woody, come on."
"Oh, thanks, Mike."
Hi.
Hi.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
You all right?
"I'm fine, Jason."
I'm watching the show.
"We do have to get back before sunrise, though."
Let's get a move on.
"I don't think that's a good idea, Jason."
"Come on, hon."
Let's go.
We're very close.
"Jason, I'm not going anywhere."
"It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go."
I love you.
But we cannot do this to each other anymore.
It's over.
It's over.
"Daddy, wait."
I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.
I'll go back to the other side.
No.
Then you...
"You,d be doing what I did."
Trying to be something that you're not.
You're 20.
Go be 20.
All right?
I will not lose you.
All right?
I cannot lose you.
You got me out here with Matthew Stafford's little brother.
That's all I can get on such short notice.
- What do you want me to do?
- Collect them cones and pay little Stafford his beer money.
I'm taking a motherfucking Uber home.
I hate you right now.
You embarrassed me out there.
Your ass ain't getting paid.

We'll find Craig.
"Hey, how is she?"

Didn't give me anything on the way.
What do we got?
Hotel surveillance cam picked this up right after the attack.
Doesn't add up.
Why take Craig and leave Dana?
"Yeah, I've decided to do this."
I'm going all the way.
"In fact, today counts as our third date, so when I say I'm going all the way, I mean, I'm going to..."

"It works for me, so nothing else really matters."
"- Oh, my God!"
- What?
I just thought of the greatest thing.
Where's Sefton?
I don't know.
- He wouldn't be at the kommandant's?
"-I don't know, I told you."
What did the Krauts trade him for the radio?
I don't know.
- Why don't we look in these footlockers?
-No.
"Come on, you stooge."
Hand over them keys.
I haven't got any keys.
"- Okay, then I'll get me a key."
-Ow.
- Hey!
-Okay.
Hoffy?
- Okay.
"-Hey, wait a minute."
"Hey, don't."
Sefton will get mad.
Of all the hoarding cruds.
"Looks like Macy's basement, don't it?"
That kid's richer than my mother.
"Oh, shut up!"
For crying out loud.
What would he be doing with these?
Suppose you ask me.
"Go on, ask me."
Because I got the goods on Mr. Sefton.
Because this time he didn't shake me.
Take a look for yourself.
It'll curdle your guts.
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Buzz?
Was that you?
"Hey, hi there, little fella."
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Buzz!
They're cannibals.
"Mayday, mayday."
"Come in, Star Command."
Send reinforcements.
"Star Command, do you copy?"
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Great.
Great.
"Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death."
"Hey, you guys, I think I found him!"
"Buzz, is that you?"
"Whiskers, will you get outta here!"
You're interfering with the search and rescue!
"Look, they're home."
"Mom, have you seen Woody?"
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
"Oh, I'm sure he's there."
You're just not looking hard enough.
"He's not here, Mom."
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
"Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away."
Huh?
Huh?
"- A federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
- Jesus.
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his SAC for about an hour.
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is,"
"""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone""."
"Baby, not now."
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I...?
"No, no."
So...
How you doing?
You know.
Lousy.
"Montezuma's Revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tin horn."
Better not get too close.
I'll take my chances.
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
Dirk the Jerk
Dirk the Jerk
SENIOR:
So you were friends with Dirk?
SAM:
"Uh, yes, sir, in high school."
SENIOR:
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
Sit down.
"When did, uh-"
- When did Dirk pass?
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, uh-- First, drinking, then drugs."
And then too many drugs and--
He just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know."
"Dirk, he, uh-"
- He had his troubles.
What kind of troubles?
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money and, well, you know, kids, they can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
Mm-hm.
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the Jerk.
"-After what happened to his mother, he--"
-His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
"NO, NO."
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING HERE.
"THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN HEDGE FUNDS,"
OR I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL MYSELF.

"I DO HAVE TO GO, THOUGH."
BEFORE THE WIFE THROWS A FIT.
COME ON.
"LISTEN, CONGRATS AGAIN."
- YEAH.
- YEAH.
- SEE YA.
- SEE YA.
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER.
YOU DID NOT!
"NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU."
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
"AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SAYING, COUNSELOR?"
I AM SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD JUST MOVE AROUND A BIT
BEFORE THE SEMESTER'S OVER.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO LAW SCHOOL THINKING
THAT THIS WHOLE OFFICE IS JUST ONE BORING SECTION.
WHAT IF I LIKE YOUR SECTION?
I STILL THINK IT'S A MISTAKE.
I DO.
YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT
"WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, WHAT MAKES YOUR RIGHTEOUS."
"ANGRY, EVEN."
AND YOU HAVE THIS FIGURED OUT?
ABSOLUTELY.
"GUYS THAT I TAKE DOWN HAVE NO REASON TO BREAK THE LAW,"
-I'm sorry.
What should I do now?
Get work with the renovators.
Dad told me to ask for Jakki.
I'm Jakki.
"Jesse, Taisto's son."
Do you have any work for me?
What can you do?
-I'm not afraid of heights.
I used to be a firefighter.
Get overalls.
Really?
Yes.
This goes into your phone bill.
-Good.
My wife is sleeping right here.
- They usually do.
I'm not a marriage counselor.
"- I have an idea, you see..."
I've been thinking that...
Hello?
Are you role-playing again?
-I guess.
"You need a life, Jemina."
You're always doing homework or just dreaming.
I haven't done any homework in years.
Have sex with a nice boy.
There are condoms in my drawer.
"Moms don't talk like that, Mom."
And I'm not sleeping with anyone.
"It's pretty cool, Mom."
They court me like monkeys.
The oldest and the ugliest.
You should beat me.
If you want...
-Beat her?
"-Come on, do it!"
"Move the lights, pay attention!"
"Get out of the way, quicly, quickly!"
Yeah you want me to hate you?
Whatever you want I'll do it.
I'm so ugly and you're so beautiful I think you should hit me.
"C'mon, hit me."
"Hit me,"
"You ugly old whore, you make me sick."
Cunt!
Let me see your beautiful cock.
And let me do it for you baby.
I'll do it and you could hit me if I do it wrong.
Beg for it.
You asked for it.
Let me see your beautiful cock.
"Come on baby, I'll do it good."
Come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
I can't.
Do it!
Do it!
I can't.
Beg for it.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Get off of me!
"Water vapour doesn't stop ice, I should've realised!"
Get off!
Let her go.
Let her go now!

Get off of me!

Argh!
Arr!
No-o-o-o-o!
What was that?
It's Clara.
Dear God.
"Oh, dear God, where did she fall from?"
We have to get her inside.
Those things will kill you!
She's hurt.
She's dead.
What is that?
What is happening?
!
He's bringing her in.
"That green woman said she was dead, how can she be alive now?"
This technology has capacities and abilities beyond anything your puny human mind could possibly understand.
Try not to worry.
Isn't the creature still a danger?
It could reform.
"No, not in here."
Then you should be with Miss Clara.
"She's going to be fine, I know she is, she has to be."
"Doctor, her injuries are severe."
-Hazelden?

-It came for you in the mail.

"I think it was Tony said he wanted it burnt,Paulie,specifically."
"-Put it in my car, I'll take it home."

It'd be an honor to hang this picture in my house.
"Tony, can you come down here, please?"
What's the matter?
-What happened?
-Your nephew.
Christopher did this?
He hit you?
What for?
-What's the difference?
-He was high.
"Little prick, I'm going to wring his fucking neck."
Where is he?
He's been using drugs.
Heroin.
-Who's this?
"-You called me, maricon."
"-Where's Christopher, asshole?"
That's like the worst combination for you.
I know.
"Oh, just..."
I'm stuck.
"I'm sorry, Dale."
Jill...
You don't have to be sorry.
You just got a little wasted that's... all.
"Oh, I drank too much."
I'm never drinking again.
I've heard that one before.
I don't think he wants to marry me you guys.
And I'm getting married in three weeks.
Dale.
Don't worry about Drew right now.
"Just finish blowing chunks, ok?"
Why don't you go make sure everything's ok out there.
I'll stay here with Jill.
Ok.
"Listen, Hallie."
I'm really sorry.
Are we ok?
Yeah.
We're ok.
I said a lot of things I didn't mean.
I'm sorry.
"Jill, I'm so sorry."
Ok.

You want the keeper's cabin.
You'll have to follow the track through the woods about half a mile.
"Right, uh, thanks."
You'll have to walk.
The track's too rough for city cars.
"Oh, okay."
"""Welcome to the country, folks."""

"Okay, well, let's stop by the motel because I'd like to thank the kid."

Ugh.

Oh.

I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?

"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.

"Come on, let's sit down."
Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.

But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.

"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
They're probably a bit damp.
"I'll take him the pot too, shall I?"
"Well, I'm sure he hasn't got nothin' that I haven't seen before."
They're nice and warm.
[Speaking Polish] Hmm?
- Danke schon.
- Oh.
English - thank you.
Thank you.
Polnisch - dziekuje.
I see.
"I'll just, um... leave the door ajar."
And I'm going to get my knitting.
Why are you creeping about?
I'm not creeping about.
I'm just...
Ollendorff and I are going to speak to him.
"- What, now?"
- Yes.
He might be asleep.
"Well, if he is, I won't."
What's the matter with you?
I think he's Polish.
What?
"He used the word ""Polnisch."""
"Well, why didn't you say so?"
Neither of us speak Polish; we haven't even been to Poland.
"Hopeless, Ursula."
"Shh, shush!"
When did he say it?
Don't push!
[Footsteps]
"I don't know, I'm..."
"It's sick, you know?"
That's all.
[SIGHS]
[DOOR CLOSING]
What are you doing?
"I was, um, I was just..."
You were with someone in here.
"No, I wasn't."
Who was it?
Skip?
I said I was alone.
"Okay, okay, fine."
I just thought I heard a man's voice.
"Come on, the meeting's started."
Let's go.
"Hello, my name is Skip, and I'm an addict."
"Hi, Skip."
Uh...
I was in love... with a bottle.
"We slept together, we worked together, and... we got fired together, and, uh...if--if booze was..."
"my demon, then, uh... 12 Steps To Recovery has... has been my angel of mercy."
"It didn't happen overnight, and, uh..."
"I never would have made it without my sponsor, Monica."
"What is this, some kind of sick joke?"
[GUN COCKS]
Hey...
Geez!

NARRATOR:
He was brought across in 1228.
Preyed on humans for their blood.
"Selena, I don't want to wait that long."
I want to marry you now and become a lawyer too.
"Honey, don't cry."
It's nothing to cry about.
"Please go, Ted."
Just go.
Okay.
I guess I picked the wrong time.
"I'll come back tomorrow, when you're feeling better."
"Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Why, Nellie you didn't have to come to work today."
Work keeps my mind off of things.
"Selena's all right now, isn't she?"
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.
"Everything is just trouble, Mrs. MacKenzie."
Just trouble.
"Nellie, don't do any work today."
Just sit around and relax.
"Happy Labor Day, Mother."
Something's wrong.
She's upset.
"Can't blame her, with Lucas gone and nobody knows where he is."
I've gotta run.
Bye.
"- Hi, Norman."
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Come on.
"Hello, Mike."
Where'd you come from?
- Back there.
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
Mm-mmm.
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.
"You don't-- oh, Dave, thank you!"
Ok.
Thank you!
You're the best!
Kai!
It's Erica!
"Look, I came all this way!"
Uninvited.
To talk to you.
Please.
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Look, I know that I made everything really complicated for you, and I'm sorry."
Whatever.
"It's not you, it's me."
I screw everything up.
Why did you quit your job?
"'cause I figured then if I disappear, you and Ethan can go back to being in love,"
Travis can have a nice little musical career.
"No, that's not the way that this works."
I don't care how this works.
You can go.
Now.
"Kai-- I told you to stay away, all right?"
Stop trying to save me.
It's not your job.
"If Dr. Fred can give up, so can you."
"No, Dr. Fred, he hasn't given up."
Really?
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?
- There was an accident.
What did he do to her?
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
I'll beat you up!
Watch the teapot!
I don't need your advice!
I'm telling you
You...
"Get off, right?"
"Okay, I'll take your word"
Why are you pulling my clothes?
"Gao, are you really leaving?"
Y es!
But bear this in mind
"It's me who fired you, not vice versa!"
"Oh, you asshole!"
"Hi, is there some gold here on the road?"
It's you again!
Stay calm!
I just want to ask you something
Mind your head!
"Oh, you two are killing each other?"
Who exactly is your Brother Y an?
Y an Qingwang!
How come he stayed with Thunderstorm?
Say!
"Y es, yes!"
I'll tell you!
Brother Jin is killed!
"Y es, after Y an Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun"
He stayed at Thunderstorm's house
Dad!
"2nd Brother, 2nd Brother!"
"2nd Brother, don't you know me?"
I'm the one that's always bullied by you
What?
I'm a dirty panty fiend.
I have a thing for your panties.
"Really, I can't get enough of your jumbo panties."
I really love your panties.
I love your panties so much.
You can stop saying that.
I'll stop saying that now.
Good.
"Now, Marnie, what are you doing here?"
Ask Ricky.
Don't say my name.
"So, Ricky sent you?"
"Oh, Marnie, don't kid yourself that I don't know all about the big secret."
What secret?
What secret?
And I don't care if my husband did father that fat bastard!
Sshhhhhh!
Coach Bowman's my dad?
Ricky.
Can you feel me closing in?
"You're mine, Ricky."
Ricky!
Ricky!
"Hey, we're trying to sleep."
Sorry.
"Yeah, I do get carried away sometimes."
I should just shut up.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
"For over a century, I have lived in secret."
Until now.
That's paper inside.
Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
"Oh my god, it's tonight."
- I don't even know what to say.
"- Don't worry, you've been so busy."
"No, please."
Don't make excuses for me.
I will make this up to you.
You promise to do ...
What's on the paper?
My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there huh?
Oh my God!
I love it.
I love you.
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
He made me promise.
Sneak.
You do everything your big brother tells you?
Yeah right.
"I'm I'd listened to him, I wouldn't be such a fuck up and you two never would've met."
Can't fault you on that one.
Alright.
- I'm gonna get outta your hair.
"- No, no."
No rush.
I uh...
I gotta go change anyway.
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
I used to cry for you!
And I used to engross in yourthoughts!
Neither did I sleep nor did I remain awake!
How did I spend my day?
And the nights too?
O beloved dont ask me..

"Sir, I am here!"
- It's totally fine.
"Come on, get in the car."
- It's Ryan Gosling.
Come on.
- This is gonna be amazing.
"- I assure you, it's just fine and dandy."
"- He invited us, sweetheart."
- Can we stop by my house?
I don't really wanna be wearing this.
- You look fine.
- You look like schoolgirls.
"- Hey, let's go shopping."
"- Oh, my gosh."
This is amazing.
"Okay, Grace, you have the coolest mom in history."
- Ryan Gosling.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Aah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Wait, wait, what did he say?"
"""Absolutely."
"We'll be here working all night long."""
"I said, ""Really?"
"It's okay if we come by?"""
"He said, ""Yeah, we're just rehearsing now."""
- Ohh.
"- Uh, um..."
- What are these?
- She doesn't know what they are.
Ha-ha-ha.
They're goldfish.
"I know what a goldfish is, but why do you have goldfish in your car?"
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
"- You did, but most of it's broken."
"Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine."
"Yeah, but it's broken."
"Hey, look at that."
I think it's working.
"- Oh, my God!"
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
"- Hey, we got the TV back!"
All right.
You guys are awesome.
I'm gonna make you so much jam.
"- Please, don't."
"- Oh, we're gonna have ajam sess."
Absolutely not.
"- Okay, what are we watching?"
- I have some DVDs.
"Adventures in Babysitting, Prancer, Newsies, Curly Sue."
- I'm going out.
- Yeah.
Wait.
Where are you guys going?
These are heartwarming films.
- Curly Sue.
Let's do this.
"- All right, let me go get it."
- Get out.
- Why?
"Unlike your father, I am a man who keeps his word."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
All right.
Here they come.
All right.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Come on.!
Come on.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
"Come on, Island Hoppers.!"
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
Let's go.!
"I'm telling you, I don't know where it is."
I buried it under a Bougainvillea Priscilla.
But that was a year ago.
The whole garden's changed since then.
"Ain't buying' it, Roger."
The sun's almost gone down and the race is over.
"If you don't get that money before they close this place, there's gonna be something else planted here."
What's with the tender loving care?
Pull it up!
"Nine, 10, 11, 12..."
Thirteen!
There's 13 riders ahead of him!
This is ridiculous!
It's okay.
He can still win.
There's still 60 miles to go.
Tom!
"Come on, Magnum!"
- Come on!
"I did my best to stop them, Judge Travis."
"Now, I can see that, Litefoot."
stains:
"Come on, let's go, boys."
Stand him up.
"No, bring him on this mule."
"Come on, get him up there."
"Come on, get up there."
It's your last ride.
"There, boy."
That's it.
That's right.
You get to go see the Lord.
"All right, get the rope up over there."
Get up there.
All right.
[whistles]
"Hyah, hyah, hyah!"
Maybe you'd like to apologize for killing that white man.
[GUNSHOT]
"Hyah, hyah!"
[GLASS shattering ]
"Glad to see you, boys."
I know who you seven sons of bitches are.
You're not gonna get away with this.
"-Right this way, gentlemen."
"-Yes, ma'am."
I think I brought everything you asked for.
MAUDE:
"Oh, thank you, Mary."
MARY:
I just hope it's not too terrible for you in here.
Clark?
Roland?
Zendaya?
- Who?
"- It's Brooke, isn't it?"
[gasps]:
It's Brooke!
I've got all I need.
"But I, I didn't say anything."
"Hey, Emma."
We're finally here.
Face-to-face.
[somberly]:
To face.
I invited Amy to our after-work hang.
[breathily]:
Oh...
"Hi, Amy."
AMY:
Sorry we're late.
It was a crazy day at the office.
"I had to calculate the company's overtime, then I realized that was making me go overtime, and that I had to include that, too... ugh, my life!"
I could really use a drink.
"I'll go order two beers, Amy."
Maybe they'll give me a third one
I didn't ask for.
"Jack, help!"
Emma doesn't know this is a date.
How can that be?
You were so clear when you asked her out.
"I know, but she brought her friend Amy."
"Okay, don't panic."
I love this song uh.
It reminds me of being in Rome.
I wonder if toe sucking is big in Rome?
Baby you want a beer?
The six pack no?
"Baby, we have good energy."
We have a good energy me and you no?
Yes.
Come here...
Come dance with Papi.
Me and JP have been together on and off for about six months.
It's going pretty good but sometimes I get the feeling I'm not the only girl JP's seeing.
"Oh, JP..."
Ahhhh no no...
Are you still there?
Just stay here.
Who is that JP?
"Ah, computer is broken"
Is crazy joke ha ha...
No...
Come out where ever you are.
I only have eyes for you.
Hey JP!
Let's do that thing with the toes again.
Call me if you want to rendezvous.
Hey...
- Bye.
OK baby is no big deal is my massage therapist.
OK?
That's a reasonable explanation... right?
JP...
JP...
Where is he?
"Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter."
You seem to have plenty of company.
What do you mean?
"If I were you, I'd stay on this train and keep going."
What are you...
Oh!
Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
You're sorry.
Oh.
"Well, Gretchen, what happened to you?"
I found Nancy.
"What'd you do, have breakfast with her?"
I think you better not go in there.
Why?
"Well, she's sharing her drawing room with a man."
Nancy?
He was in bed when I walked in.
"Oh, there's some mistake."
"Yes, there's a mistake all right, and Nancy's made it."
"Gretchen, I think you've said about enough."
"Well, I saw him!"
You coming?
No.
Not until I hear Nancy's side of the story.
Uh-huh.
Drawing Room B. I'll see you at school.
"Aunt Nancy, I still have something on my mind."
(BELL BUZZING)
BOB:
Nancy.
"He's Mr. ABCD, he's good at playing deadly games."
He's going to play Russian Roulette!
There are 3 bullets in this Russian Roulette.
Over there!
Let's start the game!
I'm done!
"Hiroshima, he's shot himself 3 times!"
"Damn it, wake him up!"
He's dead.
"You're just as dead, Wake Yoyo!"
Follow me!
Follow me!
- l heard something.
- Let me see if I hear it!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What happened?
- l asked you what happened?
- Nothing...!
But there are mechanical traps.
I'll go first!
Robin darling!
You're terrific!
You always know where they are!
Sure. I know exactly where they are.
"So you go first, I'll protect you from the back."
Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright!
I can hear something!
Him again?
"No, he's Mr. ABCD's half brother, Mr. EFGH,"
Born 3 days after his brother.
May he do the same for you.
Have hope.
You deserve it.
PAULITO:
"La Primera lives, ese."
It lives through us.
It gives to us.
It is us.
"SimÃ²n, ese, it's all we got."
It's all we've ever had.
"Carnal, remember that time we went down to the L.A. River?"
"We drank that funky, funky wine, ese."
"Man, I was sick for a week."
You wanna know what Lourdes asked me?
I'm telling you this 'cause you're my carnal.
"She wanted to know if the reason why they call me ""Little Puppet"" was..."
You know.
Made me real angry.
I think she's pregnant now.
"I guess I showed her, huh?"
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.
Don't fight.
"Please, don't fight!"
J ust die!
J ust die.
Mi carnalito.
God damn me.
Coming out?
Paulito.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Your brother sent this for you.
- Never mind.
Dad's at Aunt Rosa's.
She wants us to come.
- What?
- Dad is at Aunt Rosa's!
- He came especially?
Why?
- How should I know?
He isn't answering.
Where is he?
Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere.
- What did Rosa say?
- To come.
You're more hysterical than her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why didn't you invite me along?
That was very unkind of you.
You want to know who your father is.
Good for you.
Really.
"But I want to know, too."
"I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives."
I won't hold you up.
Have some tea and go.
It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear.
That's all.
"Rosa, where's the Sweet'N'Low?"
In the kitchen?
I swore to Jonah.
"I have to pinch myself, I think I'm dreaming."
Cut it out!
"Yahoo, ya motherfucker!"
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
Shot in the foot.
He's fine.
So he got shot in the foot.
"What is it, a big fuckin' deal?"
"Vito, get a towel."
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
"Don't get me upset, now."
"Don't make a big fuckin' thing out of it, Spider!"
Ya little prick.
You trying to make me think what I did here.
It was an accident.
Fuck him.
Little fucking actor.
-You in?
-l'm in.
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
"Karen, will you grow up!"
Stop.
I'm still gonna go out!
"Not without your car keys, you're not."
Are you nuts?

- Sebastian!
"Ariel, what are you..."
How could you...
What is all this?
"It's, uh..."
It's just my collection.
"Oh, I see."
"Your collection, hmm."
If your father knew about this place...
"You're not gonna tell him, are you?"
"Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand."
"Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here."
I'll take you home
- and get you something warm to drink.
- [Rumbling]
- [Ariel] What do you suppose...
- Ariel?
Ariel?
I know.
But that doesn't mean you didn't.
Justin.
I get the feeling you're not here to see me.
"No, I'm not."
Is Rebecca here?
"Rebecca, this is Justin."
Justin Walker.
So you're one of them?
- His family?
- Yeah.
"- I got it, Mom."
- OK.
"If you're expecting tears from me, you can forget it."
I'm not expecting anything.
I just wanted to meet you.
"Well, I'm here."
I'm real.
You can even touch me.

- OK.
It's so bizarre.

There's just you left.

We're not enemies.

Mu Yeol!
You're saying all of them sacrificed themselves?
Right.
"The documents that are related to the raid, they've all been destroyed."
The North Koreans sent a team.
All the press people are missing.
Their identity cards have been erased.
"For now, we are the only five people who know about this."
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
-Go fuck yourself!
"Let me handle this, Jemina."
-Go handle the garbage!
"See his ""use, Senna?"
It's red and round like a clown's nose.
They must've had a clown for a boss.
Let go!
I can't breath.
My nasal cavities are built that way.
No more kiddy games.
Get in the garbage can.
I'll let go of your nose.
Damn you...
Need help?
"Jemina, I've got to go."
Peku went to get more birds and the cops took him.
You're talking to me again!
Peku is out of the game now that he's in the can.
Of course he is.
"Did I, like, win?"
-Maybe.
LEVEL 2
Give him a shot when he wakes up.
Remember how?
-Yeah.
Where am I?
-In the bar.
It hurts.
-Would this help?
I'd rather take a bottle of rum.
-Coming up.
"You're a nice girl, Jemina."
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
Master finagler!
"-Oh, right."
-(laughter)
"Drink up, boys."
"Ernie, uh, what have you been doing since you got out of the Army?"
I'm with some outfit.
"Come on, drink up."
"Oh, come on, come on, now, Ernie."
-What are you doing?
"-Well, it's a big outfit-- big."
"If I mention the name, you'd know it right away."
MORGAN:
What outfit?
What difference does it make?
I'm doing all right.
Believe me.
"Secret, huh?"
"Well, in a way, it has to be, yeah."
TUBBY:
I got it-- government work.
You could call it that.
Yeah.
You got a contract with the government.
For four years.
-Four years?
-Whoa.
I got a six months' contract.
Then comes cancellations and changes in specifications.
-How do you do it?
-Very simple.
"When the four years is up, I simply reen... uh, renegotiate."
-They're only too glad to do business with me. -(buzzing)
The tea is for Sifu!
Thinking of making a run for it?
Grab him!
Sifu!
- He's Wong Fei-hung?
"- Yes, it's him!"
That guy's involved as well!
He knows Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
Stop!
On your knees!
- Sifu...
- Sifu...
You two have gone too far!
Committing crimes in my name!
You're the real Wong Fei-hung?
I've been too lenient with them.
"Marshal, please don't take offence."
I'll deal with them later!
"OK, Wong Fei-hung."
"I won't pursue this, for your sake."
"Marshal, thanks for your understanding."
"Tonight, I'll hold a dinner upstairs especially for you."
Good on you.
"Foon, come with me!"
Sifu Wong?
You've already learnt Shirt Pinching Toad Trap.
You don't need another Sifu.
Get out!
Shirt Pinching Toad Trap?
"Have another drink, have another drink."
Thank you for coming.
"Sifu Wong, I'll drink to your hospitality."
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."
Time is running out for him.
"I can feel it, John."
But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."
"""Sticks"" have the name of a club."
"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
But the respect I earned made me think I'd found the answer.
"When J.D. showed up a year later,"
I knew we'd get even stronger.
"Hey, man, what's your name?"
Hey!
Where you from?
La Primera.
East Los.
"You talk like a fucking chicon, man."
I'll check you out later.
"Órale, I see they finally let your white ass out of the hospital, carnal."
Santana!
"How you doing, man?"
"Cool, ese."
Mundo!
"You guys, check it out, man."
"This right here's J. D. , my best crime partner."
"This is Chuy, Casper, Chucko, Raymond and Big Happy."
J. D. :
Órale.
"Can I talk to you, ese?"
"Yeah, come here."
(SPEAKS spanish)
"You thinking of letting him in, ese?"
I told you he was my best crime partner.
"He ain't Mexican, ese."
(SPEAKS spanish)
Órale.
"So, homes, how's that leg?"
"Check it out, hard as a rock, ese."
"Shit, homes, throw some shellac on it!"
Shit!
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
And a six.
Pair of threes still best.
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
"Hey, if you get a chance, can you take a look at it for me?"
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal...
-...the poor box?
-Ha.
That's an insult.
I got a vow of poverty.
"Where'd you get it, then?"
I stole it.
I believe you.
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.
I figure I saved him from a big temptation.
"Oh, Christ!"
I should have been there.
I wasn't there.
Should have been.
There was nothing you could do.
Lie down.
Give me the butt.
Come on.
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
Good night.
Hold it.
Hold it.
"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
"""Just tell her we're getting married""?"
"Oh, my God."
He's only 20 years old.
I've never even heard of this girl.
And how does that make you feel?
"Uh, ""my mom got married young... and still regrets it."""
That ought to do it.
"""Are you trying to tell me something?""..."
"What, is she stupid?"
"""Just that we should slow down."""
"""I h8 u, d'bag."""
What does that mean?
"Well, 8 could be ate."
"Like, ""I ate something."""
- Mm.
- And d'bag is like da bomb?
"I hate you, douche bag."
"Hey, Elka."
Thanks for letting me borrow this.
Oh.
What did you think of my mall walk mix?
Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.
Really?
I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.
"Oh, will."
Shut up!
Henschke!
We'll leave for a couple of days.
I'll let you know where we are.
Quiet!
You're coming along!
"Hey Mr Biberkopf, how are you?"
You've been away for a long time. 3 weeks.
Glogg stove?
"No, look."
- I'm not gonna buy that.
- It's a bandage anyway.
I don't know you.
What's your name?
Paula.
Paula?
I don't know anyone named Paula.
What's that about?
"You are ill, Mr Biberkopf."
Minor injuries to your head and arm.
I need to get out of here!
I have work to do!
I need to get out!
I'll get a doctor.
Just a moment.
What is going on?
What happened to me?
"Excuse me, we need to get your personal data."
"You don't mind, do you?"
You've been run over by a car on May 12th on Eberswalder Straße.
"You are Biberkopf, Franz."
Car accident.
"Higher, all the way."
That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
It's either a cat leg or a finger.
It's freaking me out.
Let's just get out of here before these people get home.
"Axl, we can't stop now!"
"We have come all this way, and why?"
For aunt Edie!
To give her the one thing in her life
She has always dreamed of!
Wait!
I remember!
It was a book.
You buried a book?
No.
"It was in a ""Nancy Drew"" book."
"She buried a time capsule,"
"And I always thought that I should do it,"
And I never did.
I'm digging a lot bigger hole.
I'll tell you one case Nancy Drew's not gonna solve!
Who's out there?
"Ooh, run!"
Run!
"Oh, look."
"Oh, ms."
Rinsky's here...
In our meeting.
Wow.
You look so pretty.
Is that a new top?
No.
Thank you for coming down.
"Whenever parents have a complaint,"
because I wanted to forget him.
Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
Illingworth.
"Ah, yes."
I see.
And then up there.
"Yep, yep."
And that leaves...
May.
"May, that sounds plausible."
And that gives...
Stewart.
Yes.
Alec Stewart.
You've got it.
You were on fire!
"Marianne, are you the big cricket fan?"
Yeah.
"Cos they were, ""Come on, Marianne - say some names!"""
"You were coming out with them, one after the other."
Very well done for a full ten points.
You certainly know your cricket.
Let's go through the names as you put them in.
"First of all you put in Cowdrey, Colin Cowdrey."
And you spotted you hadn't got that quite in the right order.
"Brearley, Mike Brearley, captain during Botham's famous Headingley Ashes."
"Hussain, Nasser Hussain."
"Pietersen, Kevin Pietersen."
"Illingworth, Ray Illingworth."
"May, Peter May."
"And finally Stewart, Alec Stewart."
And you didn't fall for any of our red herrings -
"Botham, Gower, Strauss, Willis."
Didn't go for any of those.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?
man-- that guy has been calling me every night wanting to know when it's gonna happen.
he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.
smartass.
Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
"See my hands, and my feet."
You can see it is I.
Myself.
Oh Lord...
Hvo-jm...
It's okay.
My baby.
You know Daddy's a policeman.
I'll take care of everything.
Daddy will.
"They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost."
"He said to them, ""Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?"""
Look at my hands and my feet.
It is I myself!
"Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."

It's pouring out there...
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
"Don't worry, boss, I will."
[Rustling]
[Toilet flushing]

Charlie!
Tommy!
"Hey, you!"
"I know you're out there, somewhere!"
What are you doin'?
"What the hell are you doin', huh?"
"What the... oh, Jesus Christ, no, no."
"Hey, look..."
"Hey, listen, pal."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you...
look.
"What are you doing, huh?"
"Listen, who hired you..."
Who hired you?
What are you doin'?
"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
"You're not gonna get away with it, you hear me?"
"Holy shit... what are you, crazy, or something?"
"Hey-hey, you don't wanna fucking talk to me?"
What are you doin'?
"Hey, leave that alone, huh?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, hold it... take it easy."
"Don't do it, don't do it."
"Hold it... no, no, no."
Holy shit.
"Holy... hey, wait a minute."
-Thank you so much.
"MacNeil/Lehrer, Friday night."
Zapatti's bullet killed the child.
It wasn't the cop.
That's it!
That's what passes for good news these days.
I'll take it.
I saw Tino Zapatti's probation report.
"Exemplary, but an odd thing."
It's front-loaded.
-With who?
-With supervisory personnel.
But it's signed off on by an honest judge.
-Judge Walter Stern?
-Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"-Oh, good."
Where?
-Woerner's.
Woerner's?
-The hangout at Borough Hall?
-That's it.
"When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest."
Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it...
... justunaffordablerightnow .
Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
I don't get to do a door slam on me.
I do a door slam on you.
This is my bar!
That means I get the last
- friggin' door slam.
"- Oh, yeah?"
What about this?
!
- What about this?
!
- Ha-ha!
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah!
- Moving out.
"- Oh, yeah."
Aha!
"So, Trent wouldn't give the ring back?"
Tell me how that went down.
It was dimly lit.
Through the darkness I saw an Adonis.
"He looked at me, I looked at him."
The nipple went in my mouth.
I loved it.
I can still picture it now.
"Brett, are you OK?"
Are we not doing flashbacks any more?
"Anyway, I'm not giving up."
We're going to get that diamond back.
How do you get at diamond out of a guy's mouth?
How stupid can the guy be?
Let's just think.
For a year I was Trent oregano dealer.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
Back to the hotel?
What hotel?
The Intersexion.
I'II go check it out.
well... next!
You go.
"Name, address and occupation."
Duck...
"lionel PIourde,"
"I Iive at 157, 3rd lane in St-Jude."
Occupation...
"I worked on the Van KIee farm, but I had a small accident, so..."
I'm declared an invalid...
that's about it.
"OK, go ahead."
What happened?
What happened?
"well, a Iot happened."
From the top.
"well, at the beginning..."
"Josée Morin, Touchy Tougas and me, we... we met at the hotel around 7:00pm."
"Start with when you arrived, and you saw the black guy."
You saw him with the lady and her gun.
That's it.
That's what?
That's it... we saw them.
You got out of your car?
Yeah.
"Who was there with you, aside from the lady, her son and the suspect?"
There was the one you call Touchy?
Sorry.
"Josée Morin, the dancer..."
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I killed them for you.
You did it for yourself.
"Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you.
And you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
I promise.
JESS:
Promise me you won't go away again.
I need my brother back.
Are you ready?
One condition.
Just this.
Then we're done.
I'll talk to Calum.
He'll get you everything you need.
You talking to me?
You what?
You what?
Haha haha!
"Check this, yo."
Don't point a gun at me ever again.
Where'd you get it?
Kosovan Kate.
Who's Kosovan Kate.
She works with the Albanians.
Here.
You need to wear these.
Give the old bill an head start.
"So she's setting up her own people, is she?"
I never left you.
I could have lived with you.
And him.
Love cannot be wrong.
"But I will leave him, if it means losing you."
I give my life to you.
Tilo!
Tilo!
- Are you OK?
- (Coughs)
Are you OK?
I woke up and you were gone.
I read your note.
I crossed the bridge and just as I got to the other side the quake hit.
Are you sure you're OK?
Yes.
Let's get you out...
Let's get you out of here.
(Coughs)
"Tilo Mistress, you have shown your devotion to the spices."
The spices know you will never leave them.
"Doug, I'm not leaving."
You're staying with me.
I mean here.
I'm not leaving here.
"Tilo, there's nothing left here."
This is my home.
I guess I can help you rebuild it.
You never told me what my spice is.
Sesame.
Tilo.
(Inhales)
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
"Do you love me, Frank?"
Sure.
You know I do.
"Don't worry about anything, okay?"
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
"You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?"
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
-Just today.
-Had to be.
What was that?
-There's a damn cat up there.
"-Oh, yeah."
"Hey, they sound a lot like babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?"
"Yes, they do."
"Well, I expect I ought to get back to work."
"Yeah, well, we all got to sometime, that's for sure."
That's for sure.
Take care now.
"Yeah, I'll do that."
"Frank, get over here!"
"Oh, my God!"
What happened to the light?
I hit him!
I hit him!
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!
Get on the phone.
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.
It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen him?
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
- Bishop Allen.
- Tilt up.
Tilt up.
There they are.
- Those guys were great.
- I say hi and then they say hi.
- This song was stuck in my head after.
"- Yeah, I love this song."
It's a great song.
It's a great song.
- This is one of my favorite...
- Is that her?
- That was the girl in the background.
- It was?
Here's one my favorite Ari Graynor moments.
Here it comes.
What?
Can we get a ride?
"- Oh, that's..."
- That's you.
"Is that ""we""?"
Here it comes.
"Sorry, Tris, the car's full."
- It is full.
- Is she gonna hiccup or something?
Are you mad at me?
What I love about that is the gum that's...
The gum is just about to fall out of your mouth.
You look so messy.
It's like Andy Capp.
"Remember the impossible, like, cigarette dangling?"
That's like you and the gum.
Good night.
"Don't get too attached, Dale."
"Come on, Jill."
We're gonna go have a sleepover at Dale's tonight.
Drew!
You ok?
She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
"Come on, babe."
"Ah, that's disgusting."
No.
This is definitely picture worthy.
Is that her puke bucket?
Look at...
Becca's panties.
They're grannie panties.
Bowie.
He's gonna have the worst diarrhea in the morning.
"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
"-I don't like the C note, Rosato."
I take that as an insult.
Michael Corleone says hello!
Close the door!
Your friend the cop...
"Hey, Ritch."
It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?
"I just came in to clean up a little, you know?"
What's the matter?
-Is that something on the floor?
"-Carmine, not here!"
Anthony!
You open this bar and I'll blow your head in!
"Freddy, it's good to see you."
-How is he?
-He's okay.
He's in the back.
"Girls, take a hike."
In this room here.
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.
"I thought I could help you, Senator."
Hagen?
"-Listen, I did not..."
-It's all right.
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay.
You're very lucky.
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.
"Had this happened some place else, we couldn't have helped you."
I really wonder if she is meeting Saho-san a lot.
I became wrapped up in the world Saho-san taught me about.
Shizuru!
What are you reading?
Oh...
Familiar Loneliness.
You really are showing off!
"Now, now..."
What kind of book is it?
Sevigne de...
You have to read it the other way!
"Oh, yeah!"
Um...
The Letters od The Marquis de Sevigne!
"It really seems like an old book, Shizuru!"
Yeah.
"Shizuru, did you always read that type of book?"
"Oh yeah, Shizuru!"
"You went to the library with Saho-san, didn't you?"
Eh?
"You're still meeting up with Saho-san, Shizuru?"
!
You are the one that introduced them!
Yeah!
"That's true, but just listening to Saho-san makes me tired!"
It's so hard that I just can't keep up.
"You are too good, Shizuru."
Fumi!
You called her your teacher!
That was then!
I just want her to calm down a little!
"Oh, man..."
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Afternoon Star:
Latest news in the latest paper.
That's the idea.
"Thank you, sir."
Late Afternoon Star right over here.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Here comes the colonel.
"He's in that cabin, colonel."
"You can't go down there, colonel."
The boy's gone crazy.
BROCK:
"Go on, back!"
No one's taking me and that goes for you too.
"Stay there or I'll drop you, I meant it."
Your last chance to turn around.
I'll count three.
One.
Two.
Three.
Send the doc.
Hurry it up.
"Hello, Dad."
Why am I calling you dad;
"-You used to call me that, Brock."
-Not since I got old enough to know better.
Growing up.
"That's great, isn't it;"
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
"You don't scare worth a nickel, Dad."
"-Docs always try, don't they;"
- What?
- No...
"No, not that."
Small...
Fly!
Fly!
Flying Tart!
"No, no, no, it got off to a flying start, and it's name... was Dragonfly!"
"Thank you, Polly."
"If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil."
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.
"- Ah, Major!"
"- 6:00, old boy."
"Oh, so it is."
"Uh, Major..."
"Can I offer you, uh..."
"Oh, very decent of you."
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
"Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?"
- What?
- For a memorial service?
"Oh, I didn't like the chap."
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
"- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?"
"Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy."
"No, no, could you look after some money for me?"
I won it on that horse.
"Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?"
I'm Kim.
I'm a psychologist and a feminist.
- I'll be paying the bill.
- I'm Wayne.
Wayne!
Glen.
How are you now?
"- Ah, good and you?"
"- Oh, not so bad."
"Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one."
I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.
- WAYNE:
Sure you do.
- I'm Kim.
Are you ever.
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.
"Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain."
- What can I get you to drink?
"- Uh, we'll need a minute."
"Uh, please and thank you."
Hmm.
All right.
"Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey?"
"- Sure, I will."
- All right.
He crosses his arms.
Are you aware of the psychology behind that?
"Now, when you say ""he,"""
"you're talking about me, right?"
Oh.
Kissing ass is part of the job.
We're hot right now.
It's expected of us.
"I was expected to be at my own wedding, but guess what."
- Where was I?
In your kitchen.
- When was this now?
Don't make this about me.
You need to be in the kitchen.
"I'd be happy to work the room for you,Jack."
People don't like you as much as you think.
Move.
"Look, this came down from the Prince of Darkness."
It's happening.
But don't worry.
I put somebody in charge.
"In which case, I humbly and gratefully accept."
- Hey.
"- Guys, this is Becky."
We went to culinary school together.
She'll be covering for me.
Uh
- I
- But you're a- She's a-
Yes.
I pee sitting down.
Get over it.
- Wait.
Becky Sharp from Becky's on Fourth?
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that place.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah.
"You help her, Carlo."
-What is that?
Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those Japs?
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"-You're right, that's Pop talking!"
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college andjoin the army!
I did.
Spy route.
Harrison Withers' place.
"Higher altitude, lower risk."
But always a show.
"Yeah, everybody's gonna have some grease today..."
"All right, now, Jelly Roll."
Yeah.
Lady Day
"Come what may, whatever you say"
We all gonna have a good time
"A little bit for you, Satchmo"
"You, Bessie"
"And how 'bout you, Jelly Roll?"
"Golly says, people who love work love life."
"Dizzy, Dizzy"
"I like Harrison Withers, 'cause he's a guy that loves both."
Scooby dah...
"Scooby-dooby, du-day"
"Okay, that's it."
"Curiously, Harrison lives for his cats."
Wow!
Birdland.
But his work is for the birds.
Charlie Parker.
Yardbird.
"In any case, his cages are the most beautiful"
I've ever seen.
It's him.
"The Health Department has it in for Harrison, 'cause they say he's got too many cats."
"I know, I know."
"Too bad for them, Harrison has a system."
"See a hat, don't be home."
"Come on, up on the stools, everybody."
I've an announcement to make.
Quick.
"Come on, move it, move it, will yous?"
Come on!
"Quick, get up there!"

Get her down off that.
People have to eat at the...
Get her off the stool!
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Yeah, good lad."
"There you go, what."
- What is it?
- Open it and see.
It's not a bike.
"He's brilliant, isn't he?"
I know that!
"- Ooh, wow."
- Very nice.
It's a pump.
"It's a very good one, too."
"See, I'm gonna get you a wheel for your Christmas... and another wheel for your next birthday... and then the saddle, what."
Ha ha ha ha.
You can pump yourself to school every morning now.
"Go away, you."
Yous are messing.
"We are, of course."
"Kay, when you're ready."
Stay with me!
Warrick...
It's Grissom.
I was first on the scene.
Heard the shots.
I was in pursuit of the suspect.
What?
"No, Warrick, come on."
"Come on, Warrick!"
Where are the paramedics?
!
Please.
Please.
"Come on, Warrick."
You got to fight.
I need you to fight now.
"Fight for me, okay?"
Give me an ETA on the paramedics.
We need them here now.
No...
"No, come on."
No.

I was on my way to the diner.
I was going to tell Warrick in person that he could keep his job.
I parked my car over there just before 4:30.
I started to walk west towards the diner.
I was in this area here when I heard the shots.
I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.
Do... no.
"My... my father never looked like that, so he can't be."
He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."
- But he is.
- Mnh-mnh.
He's the best version of your father.
"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."
"Inside, however, I'm still just me."
You saw it.
"I think Gracie saw it, too."
Don't you say her name.

Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.

"Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start."
You're not taking me through anything.

Mnh-mnh.
"You two, this... this apartment, this... that tank out there."
That... that thing in the mirror.

It's me.
I'm back.
No.
I buried you.

What didn't come from the big and tall shop?
Ok.

The thing is they use very good fabric.

"Yes, there is."

Me and you.
Just like the old days.
Remember?
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
"You're a drunk, aren't you?"
Drink it!
Are you too proud to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink with your little dove.

Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
My boyfriend surprised me.
Going to countdown to the New Year there.
Counting down at Central World would be the same?
Just as boring.
You want to say that to my boyfriend?
You're leaving now?
"Yeah, boarding soon."
So you want anything?
I don't know.
No.
Just go.
Have fun.
Alright.
Happy New Year in advance.
Happy New Year.

#Haven't slept for 5 days.
Damn!
How the hell did I get to this point?
The point where my whole calendar is blank.
"Oh wait, maybe I won't be free."
Doctor's appointment.
Excuse me.
"Do you have anything that is scientific, yet artsy."
What do you want it for?
I'm buying it as a New Year's gift.
"Royally inscribed stone monolith, 4,200THB."
"Sir Isaac Newton head, 2,900THB."
Let me browse around first.
Okay.
Woman:
Are you done with that?
He did not!
Hey.
What do you want from me?
"Dad, it's me."
I stuck out my neck for you.
Now you live up-- [sigh] All right.
What took you so long?
They had to make the shit.
"Okay, so I got yours with no onions."
How you like it.
"Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it."
I will.
You should call a doctor.
"I told you, it's just a panic attack."
You sure your mom's okay with you staying here?
"Yeah, she seemed fine."
Did you ask her?
- No.
- That's what I thought.
"Well, she's been really busy lately."
She's on the phone more than usual.
"How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie?"
How are they doing?
Gross.
I don't know.
Okay?
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.
Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
You can't do this.
"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."

What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
I thought having you here was gonna teach you something.
-Then you go and do this.
-l didn't do anything.
You know what?
Your father's on his way here.
"So for now, go sit in the waiting room."
"-But, Dr. Pratt--"
-Waiting room.
Bag him.
-Got a second line?
-Vein keeps blowing.
Run first unit of O-neg.
Hold four more units ready to go.
So where's the reception gonna be?
He needs central access.
They haven't decided yet.
I'd go to Baby Joon's.
La Chiquita Roja is more romantic.
"Neela, place a subclavian."
Cordis and sterile sixes.
What was the other place?
MALlK:
The Mandarin Club.
No way.
-That's a bad idea.
-Turn his head to the left.
-Systolic's 84. I like The Mandarin.
-Got a flash.
Should definitely do Chiquita Roja.
"Candles, white table cloths, you know."
"No, Baby Joon's."
"I'm telling you, martinis and chili fries."
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.

"- I'm coming in, Ernie!"
ERNIE:

"We'll be done in here in a while, then everyone can come in."
You got no problem with the bartender.
Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."
- Put this on my tab.
BARTENDER:
Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."
"You were over there, weren't you?"
"Couple inches the other way, I'd be just like you."
"You gotta cut this out, man."

Ah.

What about Kai Ng or the blondie with her at The Edison?
Here.
The night Vicki DeMille was robbed.
There's Vicki and Chelsea and there's Kai.
I might have something.
February 10th footage.
Fast forward to 12:02:16.
Chelsea Sennett?
Mmm-hmm.
All right.
"Now March 5th, rewind to 04:42:03."
There's Chelsea again.
"All four times, Chelsea was with the burglary victim on the night they were robbed."
"One, that's random, two's coincidence."
Four?
That's a pattern.
"So what do you say, Manto?"
Eight.
Eight?
They're worth 120 retail.
Not anymore.
"Story's all over TMZ, AH, CNN."

"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially

Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?

Uh...

Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"

"It's nothing, really."

"Actually, it is."

You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.

You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.

"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
Don't let him get in your head.
"Don't let him get in your head, Dave."
I know a place you will like.
Really?
Yes.
You will love it.
What kind of place?
Like a place that has dancing?
There is everything.
Everything?
"Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing!"
You want to go?
"Yes, please, regard me."
Follow me.
"Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go!"
It'll be a girls' night!
"Okay, but, honey, honey, honey..."
"Oh, my God."
You should just slow down here for a second maybe?
That's exactly what I need!
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys.
"I was kind of counting on that, Sctan."
Joey?
Yeah?
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake.

Dave!
Cut his head!
Big finish.
Star power!
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
Better!
[Groans]
"Okay, Lance."
Here you go.
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.
"Oh, you be sure to say hi."
Such a nice lady.
"Please, Mrs. Forman, there's no need to keep up the charade."
Fine.
She's cold.
Get out.
I just want you to know that I don't need these fries.
I choose to eat them because I desire their salty taste.
"Please, just take the fries."
"You need me to take them, don't you?"
Needy bastard.
"Hi, Fez."
Can I talk to you?
"Oh, you need permission, do you?"
I think I was a little too hasty breaking up with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I like the new Fez.
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.
"You know what, Nina?"
There's only one Fez... and that is a Fez with needs.
"And if you don't like that, then we shouldn't be together."
"- But, Fez, I-"
- Shh!
"Sorry, baby."
3rd: the Atom at 1.24.

And first - the amazing Radical at 1.19.08.
"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
"- Yes, Mr. Thurston..."
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
"- No, no."
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
"Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights."

- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
"Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston."
"Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards."
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
"Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards."
But you were serving me!
Make this quick.
"We're all gonna pull you through this, all right?"
Positive attitude - that's everything.
"Hey, pal, he got shot in the leg."
I think he'll be fine.
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!

I woke up holding a winning ticket.
"Daddy's revenge, 20 grand!"
Oh!
- God damn it!
- Oh.
I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!
250 bucks!
"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."

Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."

"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."

I have a rendezvous.
"Afternoon, Maude."
A woman like this renews a man's faith.

"Hi, Buck."

What are you doing in here?
You're gonna have to leave.
Not what you said last time we were in here.
"Hell, that was a long time ago."
"Oh, Buck. I've seen all that."
"You certainly don't have to be modest in front of me, of all people."
I think I do now.
"-Lucy, we gotta talk."
LUCY:
Don't I know it.
There are a thousand things to discuss.
The honeymoon.
Where we'll live.
-Lucy--
-And baby names.
"I like Randolph for a boy, and Eudora for a girl."
-What do you think?
-What I think...
... isthatyoucan 'tsee orhear anymore.
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
"Yes, Cedric."
- Ethel will find you a taxi.
- Taxi?
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Before I dropped off, didn't you have a moustache, Sergeant?"
"Yes, Cedric."
"That dropped off, too."
Away with you.
"Well, good luck to your endeavours."
Thank you.
We'll need it.
"Oh, dear."
Oh...

I'll polish him off but I'll need an alibi from you.

"Ray, listen to Dr Penzler."
It's gonna be all right.
DR PENZLER:
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
"Please, give it to her, Ray."
Okay.
"Over here, right over here."

Because she's altered.
"-But she's a drunk, how can you tell?"
-Dr.
"Clemente, why don't you--?"
"Lindsay, no kid talk."
We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.
- Let's talk about the book.
"- Well, I loved it."
You know what else I love?
Hummus.
Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.
Belinda.
"Christine, where's Belinda?"
"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.
I am gonna have to let that girl go.
"Oh, but I'm sure she's coming right back."
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- We need hummus.
- And sangria.
"- Ooh, that sounds good."
"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."
- Where's Belinda?
"- Oh, she's not feeling well."
She's lying down.
Probably.
By now.
"- Thank you, Pete."
And this is my attorney:
Lance Lord.
I believe these are yours.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Thank you for doing this on a Sunday.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.
"To be honest, I'm a little fuzzy on what this is we're doing."
"Uh, Dr. Barrett's made an offer on the farm."
An offer to buy it.
I've accepted.
I just need you to review these terms.
I represent supplies in the farm-to-table business.
We buy non-working farms and get them working again.
Okay.
Um...
"Dr. Barrett, if you can give us a moment,"
I need to confer with my client.
- Lance...
- It's just a quick chat.
If you don't mind.
"It's, uh, it's okay."
Of course.
"Uh, take all the time you need."
"I'll be, uh, outside."
Lance:
"- Okay, 42."

That'd be the night Johnny was to call me.

There was one place in town where l could find out for sure.

- Somebody special?
Missing Persons thought I ought to look.
- Who's missing?
- What's it to you?
- Homicide Squad.
- Lieutenant Kincaid.
- l thought you was a morgue buff.
- Buff?
A nut like those guys that chase fires.
I didn't know Homicide men hung out in the morgue.
- Where you f rom?
- Out of town.
- Frisco.
- How did you know?
The accent. I can spot any accent.
What's the name?
Charlie Wilson.
Met him on the train.
I thought I talked him out of suicide.
He didn't show f or dinner.
No word since.
- Yeah?
I meant your name.
You never phoned me once.
I told you at breakfast.
I phoned you at lunch.
Why don't you get yourself in here!
"-Where do you want it, in the newspapers?"
-I'm sick and tired of chasing you.
You must be stanley.
I'm blanche.

That's not my territory.
"Man, liquor goes fast in the hot weather."

"You were stupid, too!"

"Mirroring, random mirroring."

"I do the hand grabbing, that's my job, that's always me!"
"Come on, quickly!"

"I understand, I do."

"""I mean, he's still nice."
"""I really can't stand up straight right now,"
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!
Hello?
"Crowe, wait up!"
There's no one there.
Crowe?
Hey.
Do you hear me or wh...
"Think of him in terms of Leslie... someone she might've known, someone who liked her a lot."
You got something?
I got an I.D. From an orderly.
The guy's name is Neal Booker.
- Neal Booker?
- Yes.
You know him?
The orderly.
He's so quiet... like he's not even there.
- He working now?
- I don't know.
I think this could be Neal... if he were really angry and scared.
"Ridge, get down to personnel."
Find out where this guy is.
"Your eyes are different, Leslie."
They gave them to her.
They're not the right color.
They... they took the corneas.
Just the clear window on top.
The windows of the soul.
I've been looking for you.
In all of them.
I... saw them... carry pieces of you away.
I'm here.
Put it on.
You have 30 seconds.
"Take a look, Aunt Rosa."
"On the bench, next to Mom's purse..."
- Yes?
- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."
"If you love me, then you need to let me go."
"Oh, she's gone."
I wish I could cry on demand.
Thetearswon'tcomeout.
Go ahead.
I'll just find a place to park.
"You mean, you're not gonna drive off and disappear for 6 months?"
"Because this is my car, and my lease is up soon."
I'll be right back.
"Baby, get ready to get fragged."
"- Hey, where's Brian?"
- Parking.
Where's Adam?
"Oh, he's outside obsessing over the briquettes."
Is this even gonna work?
"Maybe we should hide the knives, just in case."
Oh!
Oh!
No!
No!
You cheated.
You cheated.
"Oh, come on."
"You looked away, honey pie."
I didn't cheat.
- Slap it.
Slap it!
"- Slapping of the... no, no."
See?
That's why I don't play with you anymore.
- You know what?
You are so cute when you pout.
- 7:20.

Got him to work early for a meeting that didn't exist.

And George.
"Please, they're watching."
- Who?
"- I don't know exactly, but they are."

So maybe he remembers.
"All right, I'll call Fritz."
You two guys get back to Central.

I thought you might like some.
Thank you.
You live here?
Yeah.
"No, not really."
But my partner does.
I kind of hang around here a lot.
It's nice to know your neighbors.
Especially when they're police officers.
"Yeah, I think so."
Well I gotta run.
You can return the glass anytime.
Sure.
Thank you.

I lived in Munich formany years.
How did you like Bavaria?

I didn't really feel at home.

Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.

He's staying with me for a while.
Do you remember Quico?
Why didn't you tell me she'd be arriving today?
We thought it'd be better to wait a while.
You could've told me.
"Mrs. Maria Cecilia, the circus is on the road."
We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby.
Nearby!
We walked almost for two hours.

"What really matters is that you're here, my doll."
Let me look at you.
You didn't grow much in these past fewyears.
Let me see your face.

You know S-E-X?
It's all about SEX.
Because sex is my life.
Okay enough.
I got it.
Thank you Tutor Pleng.
For what?
For agreeing to help me breaking up with him.
Oh no!
I didn't say I would.
But...
I got you this Louis Vuitton bag for you.
Oh yeah
Breaking up with the guy is so easy.
Don't worry.
Thank you
I grabbed it already.
You have good taste.

"This week, it was worse."
He couldn't even sleep.
"And then yesterday, he..."

She's at a funny age.
No. it was a very nice occasion.
Crisp breads.
Very gentlemanly of you.
Could we make amends?
Could I invite you and the lady...?
Enid.
That's it.
Could you both perhaps come to dinner?
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
Oh my!
It's so hot outside!
And these things I bought are so heavy!
Sis?
"Sis, why?"
What happened?
.
Why am I being like this?
What's the matter?
.
Come here.
"Don't cry sis, it doesn't look good on you."
"Because of my jealousy, because of my suspicions, I'm turning into something else."
"If I keep on being like this, Migs wouldn't like me."
"Come on Sis, you know you're not really like that, right?"
.
I'm already choking Migs.
"I've smothered him so much,"
"You know, it's like this Sis don't put him on a leash."
He has to be with you because he loves you.
Right?
Come on!
Brother Migs!
Happy Birthday!

Wait a second okay?

-I'm your wife!
"Bela, what's this?"
"I'm talking about getting very, very rich."
"You count cards, right?"
All of you?
"As a team, yes."
- When?
- Weekends.
And Christian holidays.
- Where?
"- Vegas, baby."
"So, why are you telling me?"
"Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster."
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
"- Yeah, it's catchy, I know."
"Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?"
"Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler."
Yeah...
This is crazy.
"No, Ben."
This is profitable.
"Yeah, I can't do it."
"So, I'm sorry."
"- Come on, Ben."
It'll be fun.
"- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun."
"No, it's not that."
It's...
"I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me."
We pay better.
"Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends."
Why not?

HEARTY GREETINGS FROM THE GLOBE
-Why are you yelling?
-Me?
Relax...
I love your voice.
What's your name?
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
What's Pepita the Elephant?
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Did you get it all down?
"Keep it, Superman."
I'm really hot all of a sudden.
Hello.
Is it Lusty Terhi?
Wait...
I'd just fallen asleep.
"Okay, try to come fast."
"I'm trying, Terhi."
I'm the secret garden of your lusts.
I'm taking off my panties now.
My orchid is opening up.
"Where are you going at this hour, Jemina?"
Where were we?
You said Jemina.
-So?
"Terhi, let's pretend that my name is Jesse."
I don't believe it.
Remember Pepita the Elephant?
Give me some phone sex now.
"Do I have to, Jesse?"
I'm fucking paying for this.
"Fine, let's go then."
My pussy is all wet.
I can hear you open your zipper.
-Right...
No.
"Anyway, uh..."
So I can still have Daisy this weekend if that's OK?
"No, that's great."
"But you could have called to tell me that, so why are you really here?"
"Well, I just wondered if you, you know, fancied a drink or a bite to eat tonight?"
Um...
I...
I can't.
I'm...
I'm having dinner with someone.
OK.
Cool.
Yeah.
Have a good night.
"Happy anniversary, Harry,"
You too.
"What the hell are you doing here, Harry?"
I've come to win my money back off you.
You're deluded.
Fortune favors the brave.
"If fortune favored you, you wouldn't be drinking here alone."
"So why don't you have a drink with me, Freddie?"
Unburden yourself.
"Take your hands off me, Harry."
Do you mind?
(MAN SHOUTS)
Look at me!
I need your help.
I need to talk to Freddie!
"Look, Kayleigh's gone, JC!"
She's disappeared!
Eat.
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
I thought I heard you...
I th... forget it.
Did you wanna talk about something?
We can talk later.
Let's talk now.
"Lydia, come on!"
Ly... wait!
Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
"If you're wondering about Jackson's real parents, they're about half a mile from here."
In beacon hills cemetery.
I...
I have to get to cl...
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
"Uh, um..."
OK.
I've done the catheterization.
"Yeah, no, I wasn't talking to you."
"Hey, Sam."
You two know each other.
"Yeah, that's right."
"Biblically, even."
We dated.
We did not date.
We were in love.
Or at least I was.
I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."
- I don't want to.
I can't.
- I know.
- Not without Stephanie...
- I know.
I don't want to go on.
"I know, listen:"
"I gotta tell ya,"
"I have never been afraid of anything my entire life, except for your father."
"So I have got to go in and look for blockages and try to fix them so he doesn't kill me, OK?"
"OK, let's do this."
Alright...
"OK, Dr. Conner, you are looking at perfectly healthy arteries."
There's no blockages here.
So it's not a heart attack.
No.
"OK, let's check the ventricles."
I didn't see anyone either.
I made it up.
I am not going to drive my son around until he's 40.
The only thing stronger than Manny's fear is his need to protect his mama.
"Oh, no!"
He got away!
"But you did very good, Manny."
That was a frickin' rush!
But we're not giving up.
We're gonna find that guy.
No!
Are you sure about this?
Just go.
I'm walking home.
I can't even hear him it's so loud.
Can everybody just shut up?
!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
- Stop.
"- What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
Is that your hot wife I hear?
"Hey, is she still taking those yoga classes?"
Hanging up.
W-w-wait.
Wait.
Real quick.
"The listing at 225 cedar street, it's mine now."
You poached my listing?
"We all ride, one of us is bound to cross his path."
Mathematical certainty.
You got a chance to finish this now.
You may not get another one.
"Alrighty, then."
Meet up at my wagon in 20 minutes.
"-Vin, good luck to you."
"-Thank you, ma'am."
Twenty minutes?
Long enough for a man to get to know someone.
Right?
[MAN laughing ]
[LUCY laughing ]
Buck!
Uh... .
"Buck, honey."
"I think you can drop the ""honey"" part."
"Oh, Buck. I'm sorry."
I sure never wanted you to find out about Luther this way.
-Luther?
-What?
"is that your name, boy?"
"-Well, yeah."
BUCK:
Luther?
"-You gotta understand, Buck."
-What do I gotta understand?
Luther is the father of my baby.
But he wouldn't admit it.
"So l-- Well, I made a play for you, Buck."
"Oh, wait, are you telling me I was second choice to him?"
"No, no, it was only a play to force his hand."
"If you don't mind my French, all right?"
You be quiet.
He's off the force if he does not start answering questions.
You want to save your ass?
Start giving us answers.
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.
"So do yourself a favor, and stop fuckin' around."
[ E.M.S. Officer ] Yo.!
Hey.!
"- We gonna talk or what, man?"
- When your rep gets here.
- Fuck the rep.
I gotta talk to you.
- When your rep gets here.
"Rueben, can you call E.M.S. about this guy?"
Yeah.
"Hey, Moe, Harbor found one of Superboy's shoes."
What about the socks?
They find them too?
Fuckin' shoe.
Jack Rector's comin' in tomorrow at 9:00.
- What about Donlan?
"- Uh, next week."
- His P.D.A. attorney says--
- Who's that?
Who's his lawyer?
- This guy Sloan.
- Sloan?
"Ooh, big gun."
Says he's grieving and all depressed for his nephew.
"Oh, Ray's all grieving and depressed."
Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago my position in Cuba is untenable.
I am resigning from office to avoid further bloodshed.
And I shall leave the city immediately.
I wish all of you good luck.
Salud!
Viva la revolución!
Viva Fidel!
Fredo!
Come on.
Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.
Roth is dead.
"Fredo, come with me!"
You're still my brother.
Fredo!
"I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator."
Fidel!
Fidel!
Fidel!
Al.
Get me a wet towel.
Does Kay know I'm back?
My boy?
Did you get him something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
"-What was it, so I'll know."
It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in.
It's nice.
"Thank you, Al."
"Fellows, could you step outside for a minute?"
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
Wasn't that enough?
Stop walking around.
"Frankie, go do some homework."
I've done my homework.
Do some reading.
Watch TV.
Do something.
"Grandpa, all I need is the truck."
I know you know that I mean.
"Come on, Ma, let me have the truck."
I got a date!
What do you take me for?
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.
He's cool;
American style.
His parents are Chinese-style cool.
"Frankie likes going out, but they'd rather he work in the store, selling milk and bread and lizards."
Ugh!
"I mean, do I try to interfere with your bookkeeping?"
!
My business is comedy!
That's what I do!
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!
"Yes, you are."
They're the money guys.
"Okay, slippery, bath time's over."
Come out with your hands up.
But I just got in.
"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.
Come in.
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.
- If this is about today...
"- No, it's not."
I got a message.
I have to go home.
I have to be there noon on Friday.
"John, do you realize what's happening to you?"
I have to go.
"Hey, it's me."
- Connie?
- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.
- What?
"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
"I tried to get you on the one to Charleston, but they're all booked up."
"So if you leave now, you'll just make it."
I can't.
"It's Christmas Eve, John."
You shouldn't be alone.
I can't.
"Yeah, you can."
You know... when Mary got sick...
I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
"Mano, Erik!"
Mother!
-Glory!
"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."
"Will be patients, all right."
Where you going?
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.
-Erik.
"-Walk away, she is an athlete."
"Sorry, Erik, I will go faster."
Boadicea!
Which girl impossible!
I'm impossible even.
"-Then, boot to break, girl."
-Yay!
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.
You're sorry?
"Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig."
[FOOTSTEPS LEAVING]

[TAYLOR SCREAMING]
[SCREAMS]
I'm not ugly.
[TAYLOR GASPING AND SCREAMING]
[FLUSHING]
You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
SAM:
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I--
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head."
But I couldn't control my body.
I could see what I was doing.
But I couldn't stop.
I just wanted to stop.
[SIGHING] I'm sorry.
-You don't need to apologize.
Let's go.
"Shiv, we have met before."
In our past life.
What?
I was a princess and you were a warrior.
And we were in love.
What...what...what...
Zak killed you to make me his.
And the same thing is going to repeat again.
"Shiv, are you getting me?"
You lost your life because of me.
"Shiv, we can't be together anymore."
Just...just...just a second.
One second.
"Just give me a second, okay?"
- Listen to me.
"- Just a second, okay?"
Very important.
You nitwit!
Where is your Hidimba!
That bloody old hag!
You ask why am I cussing?
She has made my life hell.
- My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!
"Past life, king and queen and what not she is talking about."
I'll stab her to death if I see her.
Let her know.
What?
I am on the other side of the island.
Wait a second.
Hey!
"Buzz, the monkeys aren't working!"
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
"Oh, where could he be?"
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure!
I'll even let you drive.
-Yeah?
"-Yeah, when you're 1 6."
"Funny, Mom."
Great.
How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz!
Ha!
You're alive!
This is great!
"Oh, I'm saved!"
I'm saved.
"Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake."
Huh?
Right?
Buddy?
"I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet."
-Oh.
"Well, that's good."
"-But we're not on my planet, are we?"
No.
"Okay, come on!"
You want a piece of me?
"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the rescue."
-Next stop.
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
"So then this Miss Elvina comes in, she must have been 100 years old, and I tell her, I say,"
"""Roger's just a friend of my family's in cotton,"""
"but she won't hear of it, she just wants to talk fish."

Zelda.
Zelda?
Oh.
Did she get what she wanted?
I hope so.
I beat it out of there the minute Roger got back.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I...
I get goin' on a story.
"Not at all, John."
I like it.
It speaks to your general enthusiasm.
"Well, I do have that."
I have something else.
My pin.
"You know what this means, right?"
I surely do.
"Where is everybody, Mama?"
I'm here.
I mean Daddy.
Rotary Club.
"All right, then."
"Well, Zelda, baby, how is everything?"
What?
"Just, you know, wondering how everything is?"
"You are so bad at faking' things, Mama."
"You know, don't you?"
Hold me.

"Hey, Mike!"
Want to bat?
"Come on, Mike!"
Yeah...
Yeah!
Remember how we used to do it?
"Hey, he's gonna mess up the whole flow of the game."
"Dejalo, dejalo..."
Come on.
That's gonna throw everything off.
"Danny, just throw the ball, dude."
"Man, he's gonna take my spot."
All right.
"Remember how we used to do it in little league, right?"
"Choke up on the bat, put your shoulder into it."
"Come on, throw him a nice juicy one so he can smack it!"
"Yo, what if he hits a home run?"
"Yo, just shut up and throw the ball, B."
Okay.
"Ponsela, ponsela!"
"Come on, Michael!"
"Esta seria, aqui."
"Go, go!"
"Go, run it out!"
"Run Michael, run it out, run it out!"
Run!

"That'll be a buck, thank you."
Oh.
I got it.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
"Well, pretty good shooting, Billy."
"Hello, the house."
Anybody home?
[man] Come on in.
I'm in the kitchen.
"Hi, perry, how you doing?"
Saw you drive up.
"Just fixing myself something to eat, come on in."
It smells great.
- You hungry?
"- No, I just ate."
"Uh, what are you cooking?"
"Uh, sit down."
How do you like the place?
"You haven't been over here since Daddy died, have you?"
- No.
- I fixed the place up.
Cost me an arm and a leg.
"Well, I'll bet it did."
"I'll tell ya, things are gettin' so expensive,"
I don't know what I'll be able to afford.
I don't work.
maybe I need a secretary.
I used to love canned peaches.
I can't afford 'em anymore.
No way I could buy those.
Where's Stu?
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?

"Jacob, I am dying."
You have to stay and do what we have decided.
- Nothing has been decided.
- Anna will need you.
And Helene...
And the boys...
"They're so young, Jacob."
"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.

"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.

"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."

For three points.
Maybe look for countries.
Belgium?
No.
No...
No...
"Hungary, or...?"
What's the country?
It must be something?
"Yes indeed, it must be something, but you haven't found it."
I'm going to throw it over for a bonus point to the Araucarians?
"Oh, yes, I've got the country."
We think it's Chagall and...
Belarus?
Show me your first letters.
Let's see if you're right.
Yes you are.
Chagall and Belarus.
"Chagall, one of the leading artists of the 20th century, came from Belarus."
Settled in France.
Anyone know the town he was born in a Belarus?
Minsk?
Vitebsk!
"And whenever he did his paintings, he said, ""Whenever I paint,"
"""I'm thinking of Vitebsk."" Anyway, there you are."
"Araucarians, we're with you."

"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
For real?
Yup.
Do you want jumping rabbits in the background?
"Okay if the client wants it, I'll do it."
"Being in relationship isn't a waste of time, really?"
It is.
But I made my choice.
Actually it's quite fun.
I've learned new things.
Learned what?
Not telling.
I don't want to spoil anything.
Holding back on me now.
I've learned how to love.
How was that for a sweet answer?
But don't you argue?
It's a lot of hard work.
Surprisingly it feels good.
Weird huh?
So did you hit it yet?
Hell there's nothing to hit!
Rash: 0
Shit!
They're all gone!
Shit.
They're all gone.
So I don't have to go see the doctor anymore?

I thought you weren't coming.
Why are you late today?
Well I couldn't sleep last night.
Oh!
(TIRES SCREECH)
Excuse me.
Suri.
(SIGHS) DI Orwell's here.
Why?
Our new chief called him in when you didn't answer any of my calls.
That's grand.
"Listen, Harry."
I deleted your text from his phone before Orwell got here.
- What?
- Harry!
You look like shit.
What were you up to last night?
Getting lucky.
We think this is Freddie Lau.
Owner of the London Green Dragon Casino.
DI Clayton knows who he is.
"Come on, Ben, let's give Harry some room, shall we?"
"- Do you want some notes, Chohan?"
- Sure.
I need a laugh.
- HARRY:
Strangled?
- Yeah.
Lau's PIN was one-two-three-four.
"Why are you texting a dead man, Harry?"
This is not going to affect our investigation.
- No.
That's not good enough.
"- You have to trust me on this, Suri."
"Jesus, Harry, we can't investigate a murder if you're considered a suspect."
You know I'm not a suspect.
Now he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"
Angie W.
"[CHUCKLES] Angie W., Tricia S., Tony D."
Don't any of you people have any last names?
"Look, I heard the gunshot,"
"I saw the fire, just like a hundred other people, all right?"
Can I go now?
"Yeah, yeah, you can go."
"Hey, but first, uh..."
"Can I bum a smoke, please?"
[LAUGHS] Sure.
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"All right, here."
Right.
Having a rough time?
"Nasty, nasty habit."
I'm handling it.
That's what they all say.
"Seriously, I'm just down to one a day, a pack a month, tops."
Really.
"And, um, how many more do you bum?"
"A few, and you must be Clara B., right?"
Clara Barton?
No.
Monica.
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."
Really?
Do one more scenario.
"Maggie, you're at your car."
You're fumbling for your keys.
- Okay.
"- Emma, attack."
"Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy..."
- [grunts]
- Ah!
- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.

Samantha.
"You've just--you've just grown up so beautifully, you know?"
- l have?
- Yeah.
You should see me.
I'm kind of goofy-looking?
Ha ha!
"Lucky for you, you look like your mom."
You think Mom was pretty?
"Yes, she was."
She was really pretty.
Do you mind if l--
What?
Can you lean toward me?
is that allowed?
Here.
You're not that bad.
"[laughs] I got both my eyes, my nose, my mouth."

"Me, too."
Yeah.
"Samantha, um, about everything--"
You don't have to say anything.
"Well, let me--let me-- l did this to you."
"And if nothing else comes of this, at least you can finally hear me say how sorry I am."
"I'm--l'm really sorry, honey."
[crying] I'm sorry.
She doesn't belong there.
"I mean, it's for retarded people."
She doesn't belong in that place.
Samantha signed a consent form.

"Well, I feel good about having some of this"

5 seconds... 4... 3... 2...
Chris!
- I'm so sorry.
"- Now that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Sorry.
I need a drink.
Luke... please.
Look in the drawer of the workbench.
Find something you can use as a weapon.
"Something small enough to hide, a s-screwdriver maybe."
- He's too fast.
"- No, no...not when he spins the bottle."
"When he spins the bottles, he's distracted."
"If you can get his gun, this is all over"

"He's going to kill us, Luke."

Didja get that?
He'll kill you.
Chris... shall we?
It was me.
I sent the postcard.
I confess.
You were in Spain.
"What is it, Haribhai?"
I was terribly sorry... to hear of your mother's death.
When?
Oh yes... just now!
"She's dead, isn't she?"
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.
There's something new.
She's here.
Who's that?
Aunty!
I know that.
How did you know?
You told me just now.
Didn't you?
Damn it!
I speak a lot!
So what's the important thing you've got to discuss?
How do you know I had something to discuss?
How?
You didn't tell me.
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it.
And how?
The fact that you're here means it's important!
First drive the Gujju out.
I'll go away.
But I must tell you something before I leave!
"You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?"
What is a man who loses his wife called?
A widow?
Right!
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?

Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.

From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
–Yeah.
Over here.
"While I was checking the bathroom, this tile fell off."
It looks directly into Kayla's bathroom.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, God."

–Better than you.
"Looks like I taught you my last lesson, huh?"
Don't end up like me.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
Going after that guy was the right thing to do.
"–Hell, I got you shot."
–I always knew there was a bullet with my name on it.
And guess what?
I'm still here.
So are you.
"Hey, you really ought to get in there and see him."
Yeah.
Me and Vic aren't really talkin' right now.
He'd want to see you.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
"We found the peephole, Bob."
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!
–It's clean.
–Pop it.
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

He knows what he said.
What'd ya say?
"Funny, how?"
"Just, you know."
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
"Maybe it's me I'm a little fucked up, maybe."
"But, I'm funny, how?"
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
"What do you mean, funny?"
How am I funny?
"You know, how you tell a story...what?"
"No, I don't know."
You said it.
How do I know?
You said I'm funny.
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny!
"Get the fuck out of here, Tommy."
Motherfucker!
I almost had him!
"You stuttering prick, ya!"
"Frankie, was he shaking?"
"I wonder about you sometimes, Henry."
You may fold under questioning!
What the fuck is it with you?
"Don't turn around, I told you."
What if I do?
You wanna bite me?
"Of course I won't bite you, but if you don't leave in 5 minutes, you're done!"
Because the car's going to explode.
You think I'm a fool?
Can't I get out in 5 minutes?
"Oh no, not 5 minutes, but 5 seconds!"
5 seconds?
Counting now...!
"5, 4..."
- Can't you slow down?
"- 3, 2, 1...!"
Damn it!
Still 2 more customers?

You're Yoyo?
"Yes, this is he!"

My father said so.
How did he know?
My mother said so.
"Alright, I believe your mother."
Thanks.
Who are you?
- Helle's my last name.
- Hello!
- Not Hello!
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?
About everything too.
But it's not the same.
Why not?
On your head!
- What?
- On your...
"look,"
On...
"I'm sorry about that, Mr. Fawlty."
Manuel asked me to give this to you.
Oh!
"Thank you, Polly, and, Polly..."

"Oh, Manuel, get some loo paper, muchos, for 22."
"Uh, twent... sí."
Are you blind?
There were on my head all the time.
Didn't you see?
- Yes.
- Didn't God give you eyes?
"Yes, but I don't use 'em, 'cause it wears the batteries out."
Send my paper up immediately.
What's all that?
22.
"Evening, Terry."
"Do you like Cavaliera Rusticana, Terry?"
"I've never had it, Mr. Fawlty."
"You're in a good mood, Mr. Fawlty."
Had a little bit of luck on the gee-gees.
"Not a word to the ""trouble and strife"", eh?"
"Oh, de Camptown Ladies sing this song"
"Doo dah, doo dah"

We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.
"Ludovic, the filming has to stop."
- Sire?
- I want to drive the car.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
- I will miss you.

Stop to sit at home and mope.
I can not bear.
It's repulsive.

- Maybe you should get it.
- Me?
Come on.
- Maybe you can come some good.
- So what is it that will help?
"- You're a cop, John."
I would be safe.
"- No one is safe benleyken, Rache."
Thank you.
- Where is Mike?
- There were some things he has to do.
- Work like?
"- Yes, I like business."
- You bring me Bella.
"- Yes, I brought."
- Who are you?
- My name is John.
"Brother, I wanted to look after a while."
- Do you always sleep with him?
- His name is Bella.
She is a girl bear.
"- My brother, say I'm too big for him."
- I never would not be very large.
Try to sleep a little.
- Will you tell me a story?
- I do not know any story.
Then we make up one.
My mother does this.
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Long long time ago ...
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Because you could've killed me and you didn't.
You get one favor.
Now go before I change my mind.
"Actually, I get two favors."
What?

I didn't!

"I brought you here, I risked my own safety to help you."
The compass is in your hand.
Why do this to me now?
I can't take a chance that I'm wrong about you.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're sorry!
"Blair, we gotta help her."
"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."

"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."

We'll be back.

No.

Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.

"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
-Of course I am.
-You can not see.
"No, we are all equal."
I do not.
Will we Krill.
We are all born alike.
"I'm not Bill, there is only one like me around the world."
I am a single krill.
-Where you going?
-I'm leaving.
"-I want to be free, Bill."
Do not have that to be free.
"Come on, let's think more school."
I'm full of shoals.
We walked into school life.
Sometimes I think your mind is its own.
"Tell me, what is beyond the school?"
More-school.
-And then.
"There is nothing beyond the school, a school are endless."
Everything has an end.
"See, I'm here."
And it's not a happy ending.
"It makes sense, Bill."
If I swim to the opposite of the school end up coming ...
At the end of the world.
Very well.
I'll count to three.
A. ..
Two ...

"No, I can!"
I need this rest.

"Where are you staying, lad?"
At the inn?
That is either Monsieur Chopin or Monsieur de Musset.

"But the fuck, bro?"
"What if that's his life, man, that's him."
That's his life?
That's my life...
"That's my boy, you understand?"
"You know, he took that from me."
He took that shit from me.
"Yes, Mr. Rodriguez?"
Can I use the bathroom?
"Come on, Michael, just go."
You don't have to interrupt.
"Oye, papa, ven!"
What's up?
Damn.
"What happened, huh?"
Damn!
Rodriguez?
"Does this look like a beet salad, hmm?"
This just came back.
My best salad just came back looking like that.
"Yo, I don't know..."
This is unacceptable.
Fix me a new one...

Is there a problem?
"All right, where do you think you're going..."
Come on...

"You know, it doesn't look that bad."
I actually think it looks kind of cute.
I always figure to check out first anyway.
- Why?
- Because that how usually goes for the good ones.
You got a hair dryer?
"Unit 42, come in."
"Unit 42, respond to dispatch."
You just missed her.
- Daze?
- She just left.
Who?
Rose.
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.
But she asked about you.
What did she say?
She said:
"""I'm looking for your partner."""
Those were her exact words.
- Is that all she said?
- No.
"She said that roses were dead, and violets were too."
She's fled after that and that's the end of it.
How long have you been here?
She's taller than I thought.
"How long have you been here, Daze?"
I can't really tell.
"Time is bend up now, so I don't know."
I keep missing my flights.
What's that?
"Oh, that?"
That's his.
The guy's.
What do you mean?
There's something very strange about him.
"God, I don't know how to explain it."
At first I thought it was just a crush.
But...
I think that Mikey's in love with me.
He's only nine years old.
"He's not normal nine-year-old, Rachel!"
"Jessie, you're upset."
You've had a huge shock.
Rachel!
"Would you listen to me, please?"
- Mikey said stuff.
- What stuff?
That David was being punished for killing Rosie and that now I could love only him.
I think that he killed David.
Jessie--
"Rachel, listen to me!"
Your son is dangerous!
"If there's something wrong with Mikey,"
Neil and I will deal with it.
RACHEL:
I know we have to talk with Mikey.
We'll decide what to do then.
"I'm sorry, Jessie."
( Dial Tone )
Did you get my fax yet?
"Oh, yeah."
It's right here.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Electrocuted?
I've had enough.
Whatare you saying?
Whatare you talking about?
I wanta divorce.
My God.
Divorce?
Whataboutthe girls?
The girls'll grow up.
They only knowyou from television anyway.
"It'll ruin us, ourfamily."
You're ruining us.
"Lfwe staywith you, you'll take us down with you."
"This isn't political, Dick."
This is our life.
"Everything's political, I'm political; you're political."
"No, I'm not."
I'm finished.
"Well, this is just whattheywant, Buddy."
Don'tyou see?
"Theywantto drive us apart, to beat us."
We can't letthem do it.
"We've been through too much together, Buddy."
We belong together.
That's whatyou said the firsttime we met.
You didn'teven knowme.
"Oh, yes, I did."
"I asked you to marry me, didn't I?"
On ourfirst date.
I said it because I knew...
I knew you were the one.
So solid.
So strong.
We're heading out.
Regards to President Wilson.
"Hi, it's me, Artie."
"No, I-I-I know."
I know.
"Look, please, do you think you could meet me?"
As soon as possible.
Artie does to us what he's making us do to them.
He keeps us in the dark.
"For all we know, we're decoys too."
"Look, we're all pretty good at our jobs, okay?"
We accepted the risks going in.
"Having intel in the field keeps an agent alive, Pete."
But Artie acts like keeping us alive
Isn't a priority.
"To him, we're just-- red shirts?"
- Yeah.
- Okay.
"First, he doesn't think we're red shirts."
"And second, that's so cool you knew what I meant."
Come on.
He's got a Tesla too.
Drop that weapon!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Grab the tsuba.
Ah.
You get a look?
- We get it?
- We got it.
Yes.
Now give it back.
It's quite a nice old place.
At least the roof doesn't leak.
"To your health, my lord."
And your delightful family.
(Lord Meldrum) Thank you.
Do we eat this or is just for ornamentation?
"Give it to Foster, he'll crawl up it."
(Clears throat)
"Er, well, how have you all been keeping?"
"Fine, fine."
(High-pitched) Fine.
Good.
Good.
"My nephew's, er, had the chickenpox."
"Oh, poor little chap."
How old is he?
27.
"Dinner is served, m'lord."
"Come on, you're sitting next to me."
- Mr Foster.
- Oh.
Thank you very much.
"- I'm honoured, my lady."
"- Please, call me Cissy."
"Come along, Teddy."
Show Mr Barnes where he's sitting.
Oh.
"Yes, of course."
Erm... been in any good pubs lately?
"You see, my Olive doesn't like me coming home breathing beer fumes."
"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.
I've enlisted in the Marines.
-Why didn't you come to us?

"Quirino, they're crazy, where are you?"
I've nothing to do with it!
"I'm Mario De Santis, and he's De Santis, Mario!"
"Wretch, then it is true!"
- Ben and Mike.

Someone else could not.

She doesn't need me anymore.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
Believe me.
I could see it coming.
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"Very soon, but I'll see you before."

"Hey, Rosa."
"Hey, Marco."
I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
Yes.
"Rosa, goodbye."

Not yet.
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Tell us what happened.
"Joe was coming on to me, and I told him no."
And Officer Taggot told him to get lost.
And all hell broke loose.
So who started the fight?
Joe...
I think.
Maybe it was Bobby.
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
"Did Officer Taggot hit you or shove you at any time, even by accident?"
No.
No way.
It wasn't him.
How could you be so sure if it all happened so fast?
"'Cause Roy would never, never..."
Valerie?
"Okay, Valerie?"
Valerie.

"You broke your arm, Georgie."
Is it true you did it trick riding?
Or was it broken some other way?
You think I'm abused?
I didn't say that.
Why do you say that?
"Look, I know how the game goes."
"You people are always trying to put words in my mouth, trying to make me say things I don't mean."
"Now, that's not true."
I want you to feel you can tell me things.
You're in a safe place...
I'm not abused.
"Okay, I broke my arm when I was doing a trick riding routine for my aunt Crystal."
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been doing it with her alone.
- Lou and Peter don't let me.
- Okay.
Stop.
What's wrong?
Stop.
"I don't want to hear any more of it, and put that back where you found it."
Why?
What's... what's wrong?
"You okay there, Duval?"
You said that I could do this.
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
"Just because you don't talk about him, doesn't mean that no one else can."
I'm your father and I told you to put it away!
So put that thing away now!
[Cork rattles]

That was wrong.
I know.

It's happening.
"It's finally happening, isn't it?"
What?
What's happening?
"Well, you're letting in that Dad is gone."
He's gone.
He's not coming back.
"Whoo, yeah!"
You think the city's big.
It's huge!
And lots of naked ladies.
"If I had my own naked lady, I'd never leave my room."
"If you had your own naked lady, I'd never leave your room."
"So, hold on-- do you got the money?"
We got everything!
Whoo!

"Oh, no."
I want to go back.
"Hey, the footpath's for virgins."
We are virgins!
"Hey, not for long."
"If you guys get killed, I'm going home."
Beautiful.
"Oh, my God."
Do you believe this?
"This woman gave birth to her own head, and it sang to her."
-Wow.
-Wow.
"Hey, Cash, where you going?"
You don't ask me that.
Never ask me that!
"Okay, I'm sorry."
I just forgot for a second.
"Guys, come here."
Whoa!
This is going to be tougher than we thought.

Have you lost it man?
I'm not afraid.
"You are not afraid, huh?"
What do you call this?
I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning.
You have another half.
You won't make it in time.
You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible.
"If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember?"
But I will finish in time.
Is this in time?

You thought?
That you were going away without ever seeing me again.
"Well, why would I do that, Bea?"
- I love you.
Why...
"- Oh, I know."
"But I lost you for a moment, Harry."
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?
Of course not.
"Well, you see that everything's all right nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was?"
Of course.
- It must have been a dream.
"- Yes, yes, a dream."
You're not angry with me?
Angry?
"Oh, I don't want you to leave me."
Ever.
"Oh, darling."
I love you so much.

That's all that you're good for!
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!
"Spider, what's your rush?"
"Thank you, Spider."
"Spider, that fuckin' bandage on your foot is bigger than your fuckin' head."

He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."

"Thank you, Warden James."
"I don't know, Hauser."
Maybe the pirate life ain't for you.
No.
You want some ice?
"No, no, no, no, no."
But she was something special to me.
"I mean, everybody felt that, but she was."
"I wouldn't be won'th a damn today, if it wasrt for her."
And it was more than that.
She was my friend.
Hey.
"Take it easy, Ward..."
"Exactly what time did it happen, Lieutenant?"
"Last night, sir."
About ten minutes to nine.
Ten minutes to nine.
God knows what I was doing when she could have used my help.
"Alone in my room, probably, with some idiot script."
"You were not, you were watching the ballgame with me."
I was?
A ballgame?
(SCOFFS)
"Oh, God."
I hope I wasrt.
I was alone.
I hope I wasrt...
But you werert alone.
"Listen, Lieutenant, he's upset."
"He's nervous, you know?"
And he...
"Mark, for God's sakes!"
Will you stop it!
This isn't one of my shows!
This actually happened.
Don't wig out.
Okay.
He's heading north now.
"I'm sorry, kid."
I'd Iike to apologize to everyone in advance for this.
"Check, please."
It's a rat!

Who's calling?
"I'm really sorry, but--"

It's him.
You want to ask him?
You can ask him.
Chris?
Jenna knows everything.
I didn't tell her.
Michael?
Hello?
You don't want me to talk to him?
"Why, is that because you're a lying piece of shit?"
"I didn't do anything wrong, Jenna."
Who is she?
- What are you talking about?
- I want to know who she is.
"You're blowing this way out of proportion, baby."
"Who were you with, Michael?"
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
Did you have sex with her?
Tell me.
"Did you cheat on me, asshole?"
I kissed her.
"It was one kiss and it meant absolutely nothing, baby!"
I did such a stupid thing!
- It was a stupid thing.
I'm so sorry.
"- You make me sick, you fucking slut."
"Well, where'd you come up with that creepy old guy?"
To get back at you!
Sorry.
"Oh, fuck!"
I'm so high!
You're so beautiful.

He fucked up and played ambassador to Mexico.
I'm not that ambitious.
"Then suck it up, and find some other way."

Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
"Well, well, Rocky!"
This is a surprise.
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.
I thought it was next month.
Otherwise I would've met you with a brass band.
"I thought it was funny you didn't show, but you've been busy the last three years."
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
"- Yes, only..."
"Well, you know Mac Keefer."

"Yeah, heard of him."
- He owns the town.
Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.

- Softer than that store cot I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
"- Well, you're out now, Rocky."

"I must implement corporate review, but it ends here."

It goes well.

-Who?
"The Chinese investor, it's him."
Aksel Nilsen.
-Oh well.
I shook his hand.
Damn ...
"It goes well, it."
Come now.
That's OK.
"Helen, now comes the Chinese soon."
It does not appear here.
Tonje.
-Put away the report now.
-They must get the latest version.
It's not what's important now.
Now you just go in and smile and buttoning his coat outright.
Let me.
It is not here.
Then we buttoning his coat together.
You and I. Right?
So remember to smile.

"Who's looking for him, please?"
- He's Master Ding.
- Marshal of seven provinces.
- The Brave One.
- It's nice to meet you.
I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-hung.
This doesn't concern you.
Step aside.
"Marshal, have you met Wong Fei-hung?"
Of course!
We've even fought!
You fought him?
Does Wong Fei-hung look like me?
"No, Wong Fei-hung is a young man."
"At most, 22 years old."
"If he were that young, he'd invite you for tea to celebrate."
Why did you call him a despicable cad?
Are you messing with me?
"Marshal, I'll be honest with you."
I'm Wong Fei-hung.
You're Wong Fei-hung's father?
"Wong Fei-hung, stay there."

She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
- A tantalising invitation.
"- David, please..."
"Drink up, darling."
"- You'll be packed and ready, won't you?"
- You needn't worry.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Daddy.
"Mother, I apologise for David."
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
- You understand?
"- Of course, darling."
- My poor girl.
- No.
I'm all right.
We're all all right.
"Aren't we, Tom?"
"Aye, indeed we are."
"Well, goodbye, Mistress."
These are for you and your husband.
There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.

"Much too long, you naughty girl, you."
We must get together again real soon for a rousing game of mahjong.
"Oh, I'd just love to."
"Oh, by the way, Karen, my dear."
I have an enormous favor to ask of you.

Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."

Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."
- Get off!
- The greatest thing
That I possess...

Why is he shooting at me?
I haven't gone this fast in years.
I'm gonna blow a gasket or somethin'.

"Serpentine, serpentine!"

Crazy hot-rodder.
"I'm telling you, man, every third blink is slower."
"The sixties weren't good to you, were they?"
What?
That's not the Interstate!
Ah!
Oh!
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ow!
"I'm not the only one seeing this, right?"
- Incoming!
"- Whoa, man."
- No!
- Hey!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
My tires!
"Fly away, Stanley."
Be free!
"Boy, you're in a heap of trouble."
"We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen, is arriving at the track."
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
What?
Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
Got a minute?
I'm off the clock.
I want you to give Griff his job back.
- No.
"There, less than a minute!"
"- Well, let's talk about this."
- He almost killed a patient.
- It was an accident!
It's still no.
- Just like that?
- Yup.
- No discussion?
"- Uh, no."
Alright.
I'm not leaving until we talk about this.
Close the door on the way out.
I need to eat.
"Frank, wait!"
Nicole...
"It's OK, I just,"
"I just wanna sit with her for a bit, OK?"
OK.
I yelled down the stairs.
- What?
"- When she left for work, I was too tired to go downstairs and kiss her goodbye."
You didn't know.
No one does.
I never in a million years thought I'd marry a woman.
"I had a boyfriend, we were serious, and..."
"I met Stephanie at some first responders thing, fundraiser, and  all my everything turned upside down."
I do.
"I do,"
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hvo-jm?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
"Baby""."
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
- Shut up!
"So, I'm killing all these girls..."
He's riding next to me wondering who's doing it.
We're investigating the crimes.
Me and my partner.
"You've been a very bad boy, fucking your new partner."
"Did you get fucked, honey?"
"Well, Tommy has made a career out of fucking his partners."
- Let the girl go.
- Shut up or I'll kill you.
"- Bye-bye, Tommy."
- Jimmy!
I like this game.
"Everybody dies, and they all die with Tommy's gun."
Now we've got us a game.
"- Say goodbye to her, Tommy."
"- Jimmy, don't do it!"
"- Jimmy, no!"
- Say goodbye to her.
Jimmy!
"Put the gun down, son."
Please.
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
"- What fun would that be, Dad?"
"It's all over, son."
Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
"- Come on, open your eyes!"

Get your morning paper!

"- I took him, Gus!"
I'll say he took him!
That last right hurt me!
On the table!
"You missed a great bout, Gus!"
"Oh, you should've seen it, Gus!"
Stoker hit him with everything but the bucket!
- He was landing as often as the Marines!
- Boy!
- I'll take care of that!
- Stoker was sharper than eight razor blades!
- He got careless!
- After the third heat!
!
"I know the kid is a gone gosling, an amateur!"
"Somebody yelled, ""Yoo-hoo, Nelson, you dropped your glove!"""
"He sure did, and his duke was in it!"
- There!
- How's that eye?
It's a beaut!
I can't wait to see Nelson's hand!
- Where's Tiny and Red?
- They ain't been in here!
You might have split the bottom.
"We'll be back, my friends."
"For the time being, good-bye... and good-bye."
Look out!
"Well, they wanted gold."
Now they got it.
"Hey, Claire, get the medicine kit and some hot water."
Is he badly hurt?
Yeah.
He's got a nasty crack on the skull.
"Some prospector, I guess."
"Go away, Buck."
Get out of the way.
John!
John!
"Oh, John."
"John, darling.!"
"Claire, dearest..."
I'd like to talk to Mr. Thornton.
"All right, dear."
I thought I'd... lost you.
"Try to rest, please."
He's feeling much better this morning.
"He remembers everything, thank heaven."
It wasn't so serious as we thought.
"He wants to see you, Jack."
What are you going to say to him?
I wanted you... and I took you with us.
"Well, I'm keeping you."
Jack.
"You know I love you, don't you?"
"You couldn't doubt that, could you?"
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!

Your beloved boss.
"Fuck you, Cavit!"

"It's OKauntie, he's a friend..."
"C'mon girl, I need to go shopping!"
I've nothing left to wear.
Nothing?
As if you ever had anything...
I can buy your entire day.
"It's my photo shoot day, with that German."
Why don't you meet him later?
Then you'll get paid twice!
What's going on?
I can't go out during daylight.
Do I need to talk to yourmom?
Fuck you.
My ass is freezing'...
Swimming in November?

I called yourmom when you left your phone at the bar...
Why is that?
She was one mean woman.
You idiot!
What did you say?
Don't shout!
"All I said was ""Ahmet"", and she was already yelling..."
Sorry...
My mom is a little bit weird.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Hellooo!
I'll see you later.
"Okay, bye."
- Bye.
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!
You will never touch me again.
"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."
I assure you this late-payment thing will never happen again.
"Yep, just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life."
[BEEPING]
"Oh, that's my other line."
"Okay, bye."

"Hi, Gigi?"

We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
"Bill, so you do exist."

And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.
So you better leave at once!

"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?

It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!

But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
"Just leave her alone, you bastard!"
Two containers.
One's tap water.
One's battery acid.
You have to choose.
That's the dare.
"No, I'm not going to."
Tell me who sent the postcard.
"- I don't fucking know, all right?"
"- Chris, I'm going to pick a tap."
"If you choose, Gemma's got a 50-50 chance of surviving."
If I choose... she's got absolutely none at all.
Now left... or right?
- You're a sick man.
You're psychotic.
"- Oh, come on, tough guy."
You can do it.
Pick one.
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- Who sent the postcard?
"If I knew, you really think I wouldn't tell you."
I don't know.
"Five seconds, Chris."
Five...

"Please, don't hurt her."
"Please, she hasn't done anything wro..."

Wait at the elevator.

"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.

I'm very grateful.

You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."

I see your giant elephant's cock.
I want it inside me.
I really do.
Now it's inside me.
-Right.
Are you there?
There's no one here.
"Hi, daddy."
Are you crazy?
What if the boss sees that?
Do you like me at all?
-I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Do you?
-Do you know what'll happen - if my vegan friends find out I'm chopping lamb all night?
I'm coming.
No problem.
I'll never sleep with you if you go now.
I hate you and your barometer.
I'd rather marry Peku than you.
"I hate you, Peku!"
"Kaitsu, I mean!"
Any explosives?
-Come on!
No way.
How about the fireworks stuff that got banned?
You're a genius!

You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Did you do that?
Do it again.
In time.
"No, now."
In time.

Even though you not a Ferrari.

You drive the hard bargain.
OK.
Luigi make you a new deal.
"You buy one tire, I give you three for free!"
"Oh, would you look at that?"
"Ramone, Ramone!"
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.
"No, no, no, no."
Deal me out.
Pass.
"No, thank you."
"- No, no, no, no."
No.

My last offer.
"You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!"
Done.

You know where I am.
Ah!

You know that?
That's what they love around here.
They need girls like you.

Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.
I like to be thanked.
No.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to."
Come on.
Get off me.
Don't play hard to get.
Get away.
Get off me!
I don't mind if you don't.
Get back.
Get away!
"Come on, we're gonna trade favors."

Definitely not a funny way to die.

"I need you to be honest with me, Javier."
Because I can't have someone lying to me.
"To my face, under my roof, on my time."
That's a lot of prepositions.
"I mean, there's no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there?"
"I mean, we made promises to each other."
"I mean, we have a contract."
That's like making promises.
Isn't it?
Maybe I should get back to work.
"Oh, yeah."
"Right, yeah."
"That's great, yeah."
- Javier?
- Yeah.
We're good.

Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.

Of course.

Can you take me home?
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
I'll read them to Alicia at night.
They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
Are you going alone?
Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
About what?
Loneliness.
I want to get married.

When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.

I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.

You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.

No.

I want you to--
I need you to understand that you are safe.

You are completely safe.

I do it to protect this family.

"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.
Blast off.
180.
200.
Good Housekeeping Seal of approval.

U.S. Government certified.

Lunar trajectory.
Junk of the Month Club sirloin steak.

"Grade ""A"" poison."
Absolute dynamite.
89% pure junk.
Best I've ever seen.
"If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing on this load for two years."
- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?
- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuff'll take a 7-to-1 hit on the street.
"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
"Take what's left there with you, and good night."
Uh-uh.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
"If anyone should be there,"
I should.
I feel awful.
You have to tell me where you got those boots.
Olivia?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to use my journalistic connections to get them out.
"Now, which one arrested Zack?"
Grumpypuss behind that desk.
And don't touch his hat.
He's very attached to it.
Marion?
Olivia?
Oh...
"Oh, my God."
Darling.
You're alive!
All right.
"Olivia and Abby can catch up, but we've got to get you to the hospital to meet your son, mister."
When did you get a Porsche?
"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.
I didn't know your brother was...
An expatriate.
I know.
It's surprising.
Okay.
"Billie, I'm out and on the way."
How you doing?
They won't let me eat.
Tell them to let me eat!
"Dude, it's all going down, man."
Tell me.
What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!
Interesting?
"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!
Master!
Reward!
Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
FINN:
I think I know where he might be.
(KEYS JINGLING)
JASPER:
Christ.
What's he keeping in here?
FINN:
I don't know.
Him and the previous manager added this door years ago.
"God, please, oh, please, don't let him be in there."
There's no way.
"If there was a dead body in there, we'd be able to smell it."
"(GASPS) Oh, God."
What?
Is he in there?
"Oh, my God."
"Close it, close it."
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
Did you see his suit?
It was fine.
It wasn't even touched.
Isn't it obvious?
"I mean, you read his journal."
He broke the cardinal rule.
You don't fuck with time.
"Jasper, please take his hat off."
It's my thinking cap.
What the hell is there to think about?
"We need to call the police, guys."
Hang on.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door, do you hear me?"
I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs.
I'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out!
"You'll go far, Henry, unlike this piece of shit."
"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
- Higher self!
- Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.
"Oh, shit."
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
"I'm sorry you're upset, okay?"
- Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
"That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this."
"Hey, I..."
"I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way!
This place is not haunted by a ghost!
"And when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new king of... it's right behind me, isn't it?"
Aah!
- Donkey!
"- Oh, my goodness!"
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah...
"Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
"Grab the kids, and let's get going."
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!
Run!
Run for your life!
- Keep away!
Keep away!
- Take it!
Something more interesting in the scene?
All were killed with a 9mm pistol.
The gun was not found.
But back to what we were talking about.
Christer calling you.
He said that a person would be killed.
But he does not talk you who is?
The Christer knew who it was?
I do not know.
I could not ask before it shut down.
You were covering Christer.
Why did not he tell them?
-No Was Lars who answered.
He called you often?
What does this have to do?
-Christer Was his brother. -how Do you know?
I am the police.
We will continue?
I wonder how long you have to spend.
Strømme.
Yes?
Ok.
I come already.
Exploded a bomb in Exodus.
It is a restaurant in the center.
-Still Not just here!
-Acabou To happen!
-Exodus Is controlled by the league Z.
-Hammit Milonkovic?
I'll go with you.
-how Come?
We're looking for his daughter.
Get away.
"Give me, what I need now is this."
I'll go to the ladies!
She recovered even before putting it on!
Must be very potent?
Darling!
Wait for me here!
Don't go away. I'll go put some on.
Save some for me!
The Formula is in the smallest tooth-brush.
Burglar...!
Stop drinking.
You'll get drunk!
I've been sober these last 3 years.
Useless!
Has he ever been sober?
You again?
Don't stand there.
I'd never ask you to dance.
I feel like dancing with someone handsome!
Me?
"Sam, the record's stuck!"
"Watch it, don't get fresh!"
It's you who's getting fresh.
Damn you!
- l feel dizzy!
- Me too!
How much does Fat Pig pay you?
Such awful taste!
I had worse taste 3 years ago!
Fat Pig is a traitor.
You'd marry a traitor?
"Granville, far be it for me to try to influence a h--hunchback."
Come on.
"There she goes, the grocer's delight!"
-
"- Granville, have you got that mike fixed up?"
-
- Just a minute.
The nurse is there.
I want to catch her before she goes in.
I've got an idea.
-
- Come on.
-
- Here you are.
"Thank you, Igor, my faithful servant."
This is what I'm going to say.
"""Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, folks!"
"""This is Ark--Ark--Ark..."
This is Ark...
"This is Ark--Ark..."""
"I don't think I'd b--better do this, Granville."
Did you notice a little s--stammer?
"Nothing worth talking about, no."
"But you'd better let me do it, just in case."
You look more like a duck's jockey.
Disc jockey!
Disc jockey!
"In my case, a slipped disc jockey!"
Don't worry.
"Listen, don't start it off till I give you the signal."
"You'll get your ID card, then you can tell your lovely Harald all."
He will make you forget everything.
Forget?
What can he make me forget?
I have nothing but hate left for him.
"But I won't let him forget, I'll show him"
He's in for a shock when he sees what he's done to me.
Hold on for a minute!
What is it?
Get dressed and hurry away!
My brother-in-law.
Damn!
Is there nobody here?
"You're sleeping in broad daylight, right?"
"But not in my underwear, Karl!"
"Also, still cheeky!"
I drove through the night.
And you've arrived 3 days too late.
Father John!
What?
- I said:
Father John!
Are you crazy?
Told you:
Not in my underwear!
In what hospital is she then?
Hospital?
The birth took place here.
Karl!
Mommy!
"You have a son, Mr John!"
Why is he in such a hurry?
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
-It's nothing.
"Hey, it's me."
Why can't you tell me?
Okay.
Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
"Well, does she like you?"
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
"Wait, I thought you hated everyone at work."
"No, no."
I only say that..
so Chandler won't feel threatened because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
"Sorry, sorry."
And I'm your only friend too.
"So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?"
"-No, I don't think so."
-Okay.
Is he a good guy?
"Yeah, he's the best."
"Well, I said maybe, but... look at his pant cuff, Tony."
Is that a gun?
Could be.
We have guns.
Not Ellie.
Uh... she packed hers.
"No, actually, mine's on me."
"Well, I-I thought you said you weren't comfortable traveling with it."
"Well, I wasn't at first, but it's become kind of a habit."
"Listen, this guy could be law enforcement, so let's show him ours and ask to see his."
"What, guns?"
Badges.
Hey.
Sorry to bother you.
"Again, you mean?"
Yeah.
"Uh, but this time I need to see some I.D."
"Well, too bad."
I'm not Navy.
She asked you a question.
You're making a big mistake.
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.
Oh.
Okay.
"Well, what's his deal?"
I'm an air marshal.
Mike Beers.
Thanks for blowing my cover.
"Sorry I drew on you, Mr. Beers."
These two kind of...
forced my hand.
I don't think so.
[snaps] Go wait by the door.
So we have a deal?
"You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones."
- Whatever those are.
"- [man] One, two, three, four!"
[rock music plays]
- He bought it.
"- Yes, he did."
"More importantly, he had no idea it was you."
"Yeah, but was all that really necessary?"
I am not whipped.
"It's all part of the play, Richard."
- Not my play.
- No.
Uncle Eddie's play.
[upbeat music] [applause]
Welcome back.
"Today we are doing a very special show,"
"""Foxy at 50... and Beyond."""
"- Welcome, guys."
- [applause]
"So, Dr. Jane, you have a hot new book out there titled,"
"""When I Grow Up I Want to be a JILF."""
"It's GILF, Donny."
As in grandmother I'd like to f...
- Uh...
- A GILF.
- Right.
- [laughter]
"Today, 50 is an entirely new landscape."
And you are lucky to have such a stallion at your disposal.
"No, your needs are fine."
It's your neediness that's the problem.
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.
You didn't want me to make a scene?
You didn't want me to make a scene?
Ha!
You dump Fez!
I dump fries!
There's your scene!
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.
"Oh, poor Fez."
Too depressed to leave his room.
- That's it.
"You guys, we gotta cheer him up."
- Knock first.
"If Fez is alone, I'm guessing he's not wearing pants."
"Oh, awesome!"
Wait.
Let's catch him.
"- Oh, wow."
- Wow!
Check out all this great stuff.
"Oh, my God."
Is that a race-car bed?
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!
Oh!
"Fezzie, come on out."
I can't.
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!
- Fifty bucks!
- I didn't get any...
- I bet you didn't!
- Hold it!
You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!
- What kind?
- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !
13 with three cents to the governor!
That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
But I thought maybe we could make an exception.
Or not.
"You are not helping your cause here, son."
"Stand down, or--"
Or what?
You'll send me to my room?
And I'm not your son.
I'm not even his.
I thought I was his partner.
But not anymore.
Guess they're right about you three.
You're not ready.
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Superman to Justice League.
There's been an explosion at Project Cadmus.
It's on fire.
I've had my suspicions about Cadmus.
This may present the perfect opportunity to--
ZATARA:
Zatara to Justice League.
The sorcerer Wotan is using the Amulet of Aten to blot out the sun.
Requesting full League response.
-Superman?
-It's a small fire.
-Local authorities have it under control
-Then Cadmus can wait.
All Leaguers rendezvous at Zatara's coordinates.
Batman out.
-Stay put.
-What?
Why?
This is a League mission.
- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
What about us?
"It's always Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time."
"You can't change things now, Anna."
Hello?
Why are you sitting here?
Sweetheart!
It's lovely to see you.
- I can't stand it when we fight.
- Me neither.
But we need to talk about this properly.
- Yes.
- Like grown ups.
"- Of course, sweetie."
- So stop calling me sweetie.
- What can I call you then?
- You could call me Anna.
Okay.
Did you marry Jorgen for my sake?
So that I had a father?
No.
I love Jorgen.
Do you?
A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
Huh?
You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control.
"Well, guess what..."
I'm not that man.
I'll show you!
You little whore!
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Emma, let me see your hand."
You keep the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!
How the fuck could you let her get out alone?
"You crossed the line, John."
You put the girl in jeopardy.
"Yeah, well, I didn't lose her."
She's reckless because of you!
To get to you!
"Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister!"
She's gone!
"Oh, man!"
She's probably at the EI.
Come on.
No.
No way!
You stay out of this!
You fucked up enough already!
Come on.
Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear?
Anything?
Couldn't you have lied?
I did lie.
Help!
Help me!
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
That dog belongs to me.
"I bought him, Smith, and I don't allow my dogs to be shot."
"That is, of course, unless I shoot them myself."
That's all right.
I'll give you twice what you paid for him.
He's not for sale.
"Just as you say, my good man."
Just as you say.
"Well, what others have you?"
"- Uh, here."
Hitch 'em up.
- These two will do.
I ordered a collapsible bathtub from Seattle.
Did it get here?
It's a bathtub.!
It's a bathtub.!
You sweet meats.
You're losing your home.
Easy with ye.
Come on.
Out.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Harmon."
"Here ya are, Mr. Smith."
We thought it was something to pile wood in.
The only bath a person gets up here is by the sweat of the brow.
How interesting.
Mush!
"Been a great pleasure, gentlemen."
A great pleasure!
Nice guys.
Defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
Where is she?
Where's Hyo-jin?
!
Hyo-jin!
What is it?
Where are you headed in the dark of night?
I'm asking you.
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?
Girl about this tall?
Yeah.
Hyo-jin?
That's right.
She's possessed by an evil spirit.
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He's trying to suck her blood dry...
Shut the fuck up!
"Answer me, bitch!"
Where is Hyo-jin?
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?
"At your home, where else?"
She's not home.
She is.
She just got back.
Don't go now- or you'll all die.
"If you go now, your whole family will perish."
What are you talking about?
The Jap is waiting for you... to annihilate your family.
He's dead.
You've got your million.
"No, jim, i haven't."
"Oh, of course you have."
What do you mean?
I gave it all to nick.
"I had to, jim."
He needed money desperately.
I had to help him.
Don't you see?
"Sure, i see."
Try to understand.
I understand.
I'm just beginning to understand.
"We know you're in there, jim fisk!"
"Come out, you yellow-bellied crook!"
What's the matter?
Are you afraid?
Come on out of there!
"Jim, you can't go out there."
They'll mob you!
You think i'm afraid of a mob?
Jim!
"You stay here, josie."
This is one time the colonel is going to be at the front of his regiment.
Jim!
Jim!
"What's the matter, boys?"
Losing your nerve?
"This is no joke, fisk!"
This is no joke!
"If it is a joke, it's on me!"
You can't talk yourself out of this!
Vibrant!
Superb!
So glad to hear it!
"- Tony, are you OK?"
"- I'm top-notch, buddy."
Enjoying your night out?
Me too.
"Hey, Nips."
"- Don't call her Nips, Tony."
"- Why, what you gonna do?"
"I'm, uh, objecting."
Strongly.
- Come on...
"- Tony, what are you doing?"
"Isn't she pretty, hey man?"
Tony.
You two make such a sweet couple!
Out of all the world's famous lovers
- Anthony and Cleopatra...
"Taylor and Burton, Jordan and Peter..."
Stop it.
Bert and Ernie...
I would say that you two are quite possibly the greatest snog history has so far encountered.
"What is wrong with you, Tony?"
Are you OK?
What is it with you people and the concept of OK?
"I mean, we're a fucking threesome, aren't we?"
You know... peas in a pod.
"A fucking family, that's what we are."
D'you need to sit down?
Just calm down.
No...
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
I'm Marybeth Cogan.
We met at the hospital.
That's Randy and Maria?
These are my kids.
-Please sit down.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry to have to talk to you here.
-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Do you readme?
"Listen, we losthim on the bridge."
Right.
I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
You take Sal.
I'll take the beard.
There goes Sal.
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Yeah, guyjust walked in, what's his name?"
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.
"He made me, too."
"He lives on four, he went up to six."
"He's cute, real cute."
The other guy's a Frog.
He checked into the Edison.
Had a hooker sent up.
You should have collared him right there.
- Who's on him?
- Klein.
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.
"Why don't you do the same, Doyle?"
You look like shit.
Come on.
"Look, my partner and I made this case, you know, originally."
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case?
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?
No.
"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
"They can help you, Dr. Bryar."
Not any more.
- Let me know when HRT's ready.
- Got it.
"Gideon, you send those guys in there, hostages are going to die."
Yeah.
"You don't do something, they're going to die anyway."
It's not gone.
I know.
"Well, you said when the chip came out, it would go away."
It's...
I still hear it.
Then there must be more of them.
"You said it was the only one, Leo."
I can still feel the buzzing.
The burning.
- Dr. Bryar?
- What?
- Reid.
"- It's all right, Elle."
Is there another one?
You know there isn't.
"- Lf there were, Leo would have told you."
"- Don't listen, Ted."
Make it stop!
I know what it's like.
- Make it stop!
- I know what the voices are like.
He's trying to trick you.
The voices.
They won't stop.
They've been talking to you since you were a child.
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:
What I'm trying to show you is that there's a difference.
There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:
She wanted to do it.
LAURA:
Really?
She told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.
- Is that not right?
PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
"- Ari, look at us becoming BFF's."
- I know.
- I love that it's capsulated on film.
- It's on film for...
- That's an attractive looking face.
- You're drunk.
- Good look.
- You're beautiful.
"Ari, when you..."
- Okay.
- I love this.
Have you been looking at me?
"""I've been looking at you guys."
"Have you been looking at me?"""
A lot of good practice.
Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.
Now it's done.
I'm callin' this in.
Thank you.
"Hey, guess what?"
"In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch."
Hello.
"No, no, no, no!"
Shit.
Hey.
"You, you're out."
Where you taking me?
Shut the fuck up.
We're almost there.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Blair, I'm so sorry."
"Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot."
I just...
Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys.
He's the only one powerful enough to get you out.
Okay.
"Blair, we have to go."
We have to get out of town right now.
"No, Ollie."
I gave him everything we had.
And I had to borrow on top of that.
"Look, you don't have to worry about that right now."
"No, I have to worry about it, okay?"
He calculates his late fees in body parts.
"All right, when's our first payment?"
Next week.
Fuck.
It came from outer space.
I saw it.
And it was headed toward land.
I called the government in Washington about it.
Maybe it was a Sputnik or an invader from Mars.
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.
Unidentified?
"Knowing you, earl, I'd say it was either whiskey or beer."
I saw it too.
I rest my case.
I believe you.
What if it is Sputnik?
Or a flying saucer...
... fromMars?
I bet we could find it.
"Sorry, kid."
I didn't really see anything.
"If we don't stick up for the kooks, who will?"
"Is my son bothering you, sir?"
No!
call me Dean.
"Hogarth, you were going to get your pet, honey?"
"I will, Mom."
-Right after I finish talking with--
-Dean.
-Found your pet.
-Where?
"squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth."
I'm trying not to wig out here.
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.
Beans didn't do anything.
He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag.
No!
No!
Don't you touch Beanbag!
No!
All right!
Bonus round.
Winner takes all.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.
"- Okay, that's not necessary."
- Cindy.
"- Well, listen, take care, guys."
See you later.
- [ Ray ] Hey.!
"- What happened to you, Freddy?"
- [ Chuckles ] Fender benders.
She's kinda cute.
[ Phone Ringing ]
- [ Ringing ]
- Dispatch.
Hi!
Can I call you back?
bye.
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I got it.
[ Phone Ringing ]
Dispatch.
"No, no."
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
"Jack, it's me, Jane."
Just checking in on the latest on the Bentleys.
"Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank."
- There's something going out between those brothers.
We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Golf Hotel to all units.
I need a report.
Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
I want two of you on doors!
Get outta here!
"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."
Where?
"Too late now, you'll have to look up through the roof but you won't see it."
"Oh, Red, you missed a spot."
See it right there?
- No!
No!
- On the hood right there.
"Stop, stop!"
That's cold!
Help!
Please!
Stop!
"Thanks, Red."
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
"If you do, you gotta be clean."
'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.
"What, I...?"
I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
"I mean, not with me!"
But there.
"Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone."
"- And I'd be in my cone, and it's..."
- Wait.
"Wait, you're being nice to me."
"If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine."
- I understand you criminal types.
"- No, no, no, no."
That's OK.
"- Yeah, the Cozy Cone."
- It's newly refurbished.
- Your sisters.
JANINE:
"I mean, everyone makes mistakes."
"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not?"
"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:
I am married.
And what's your question?
MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:
It's moving fast.
Just on our way.
"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
"Nice going, Campbell."
"Hey, Ben."
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
"Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,"
"Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar."
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah.
Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
"You live in Washington, D.C."
"Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach."
Will anyone help me?
Hey Gocha...
"Don't put pressure, he may die."
"See and tell me, I must kill him."
I must kill him.
"Hey, Doctor?"
- He's on the bed.
- Wake him up!
"Doctor is there, but what you do there?"
What to do now?
Gocha...
Gone again!
My partner said he's in this quarry.
He can't speak properly.
Even a sorry would hear like quarry.
"Sir, is Singamuthu's son a fool like you to come here?"
Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
What?
"You said you'd love to call me but then you said, ""Look forward to hearing from you,"" and..."
You see how that's kind of confusing?
"Yeah, look, we'll talk."
We'll get in touch.
You did it again.
Very vague.
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense.
"Goodbye, Gigi."
- He was cute.
"- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him."
What are you doing?
I'm not calling him.
"If he wants to see me, he'll call."
Wow.
That guy Alex really made an impression on you.
Was he hot?
No.
He was just right.
Morning.
"Morning, Ryan."
A surprise mocha venti just because you're so awesome.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Good morning.
Okay.
So?
"Oh, hi."
- He asked me out.
NATHAN:
Come to my cabin immediately
Okay sir..
Sir..
- Is your son a Police officer?
I am asking you.
Why do you laugh?
Is your son a Police officer?
He is not even passed Inter.
How can he become a Police officer sir?
"No, he is lying."
"He is a Police Officer, I have seen."
I now understood whom you have seen.
"I, myself was confused being his own father."
No surprise in you being confused.
What are you saying?
There is a Police Officer who looks same as my son.
He even has a girlfriend.
He speaks non-stop in Hindi.
My son doesn't know any Hindi.
Are you sure?
How can person failing Inter and working as stuntman become a Police Officer sir?
You can go now..
- OK sir.
Sudhakar..
- Sir.
I am sending the details.
You do an inquiry.
You're so fat!
- Hello.. you.
Do you know him?
Our Bruce Lee..
What is he doing?
Colton!
Colton Graham can help us out.
- No!
Fuck that!
- Yes!
No doubt.
"If anyone could clear your names, it's him."
"No, I'm sorry."
That dickweed is not helping us.
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?
Not anymore.
"But the wedding is at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas."
"But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whole... wedding thing, right?"
"You know, that actually might be our only hope."
Fuck!
How do we get there?
We can't go to the airport.
They're looking for us.
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?
But first...y'all got to get in the spirit of the party.
"- What do you mean, spirit of--"
- What do you think I mean?
- What about you?
- Me?
I've been in the spirit.
"- Oh, God!"
"- Oh, my God, dude!"
"Oh, my God!"
"- Love your dickdo, Raza."
- Yeah.
This is a fucking waste of time.
Mary Ann:
"Yeah, you shut your mouth."
This is all because of you.
Because you had to stay out late.
- It's not my fault.
"- If I don't get us out of here, you have no idea what's going on--"
- It's not my fault you don't know how to fight back.
"- Horace, go, go, go."
Okay.
- Wait a sec.
- God.
- Honey.
Sylvie.
"- Hi, Aunt Abby."
"- God, here, please, Sylvia, take your brother out to the car right now."
- What?
- Where are we going?
"- This better be for real, Mom."
- Take your brother out.
Abby:
"Shut up, Sylvie."
"- Go, go."
- Okay.
"- Oh, my God."
- What about Pete?
"- My bag, my bag."
"- No, no, no--"
"- No, Mom, forget your stuff, just come."
"- Mary Ann, Mary Ann, just come now."
"- No, wait, I'll be right there, I'll be one second."
"- Okay, hurry up!"
Doo-dah doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night
Goin' to run all day
Gonna bet me money on the bobtail nag...
I did it my way.
Can't stand Frank Sinatra.
"""You make me feel so young""."
Rubbish.
"You seem very jolly, Basil."
Hmm?
You seem very jolly.
Jolly?
"Yes, jolly."
Sort of... happy.
"Oh, happy."
"Yes, I remember that."
"Not that I noticed, dear, no."
"I'll report it if it happens, though."
"Well, you look happy to me, Basil."
"No, I'm not, dear."
"All that dancing about, singing and rubbing your hands."
"Just my way of getting through the day, dear."
The Samaritans were engaged.
I thought maybe you were in love.
Hah!
"Only with you, light of my life."
Or had a bit of luck or something.
"Did Mr. Hawkins deliver the tonics, Terry?"
"Yes, he did, Mrs. Fawlty."
Manuel!
Manuel!
"Oh, your horse, it win!"
"I think you hit it again, sir."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"Ready when you are, Mr. Fowler."
Be right there.
"Oh, sir, if you didn't think I was gonna be in the way,"
I would love to...
No.
Not at all.
Be my guest.
"Oh, thank you very much, sir."
I appreciate that.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I don't wanna appear grabby, but do you think I could have one of these, sir?"
Certainly.
As many as you want.
That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
You think?
I think you're really brave.
To consider rebuilding who you are.
I don't know if I could do that.
You could.
"- Well, I gotta go."
- Oh yeah.
"Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?"
"Yeah, I'm just not sure if I do."
I'll see ya.
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.
- Hey.
- I got you something.
But I don't have anything for you.
And yet you do.
A couple of songs on there that made me think of you.
Of course most things do.
I didn't know you were into Travis.
"Are you kidding, I love Travis."
He's the best.
Who?
Travis guy.
Are we not in the same conversation?
Check out tracks 8 and 13.
You'll love them.
Bye.
Thought you might want that back.
I already have it.
So do I.
Tracks 8 and 11?
Totally you.
So what are you doing?
Here.
This isn't too bad.
Here.
Jones...
Jones?
"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.
What's happening?
We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken- if it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
- But he's coming this way.
- [Tia] who is he?
- [muscles] our worst enemy.
- He's worse than the goons.
"[Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
[dazzler] let's go.
[all] yeah!
That's our hideout.
[stairs creaking]
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?
[Rocky] don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
[gasps]
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough"
If you take orders from your mom or older sister.
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
[crusher] yeah.
- Tony!
- [boys] where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
Shh.
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
Shh!
I hope you don't mind that we opened things up.
Long as you pay for them.
"Not planning on drinking that beer and driving, are you?"
LILA:
No.
No.
We wouldn't do that.
This is for later.
Just kidding.
"CASHIER: $7.95, please."
Y'all have a nice night.
Y'all too.
"She's too young for you, Bill."
I like them young.
Shit!
"That trooper's behind us, man."
Don't look back.
Just be cool.
What do we do if he pulls us over?
He ain't going to pull us over.
"Slow down, Ray."
Don't panic.
"He recognized me back there, man."
I know he did.
"If he did, he would have arrested you."
He was just looking us over.
"White boy and a nigger girl in Texas, that's all it is."
Right now he's probably running our plates.
FEMALE RADIO DISPATCHER:
5-42.
"5-42, go ahead."
"On your out-of-state plate,"
Can we spend some time together?
You're so beautiful.
- You're not serious.
"- No, you're really beautiful."
I envy you.
"- Please, stop."
You're much prettier.
- Not at all.
- How old are you?
- How about you?
Thirty-one.
I'm older.
You are?
Then I should call you Big Sis?
How did you meet Joongrae?
It was just a coincidence.
He wanted to have a drink so we did.
What do you want to have?
"Oh, it's my treat."
What would you like?
Should we go over there to the inlet?
I think it's not far.
"Oh, the inlet?"
"Sure, I haven't been there yet."
"Well, hop in."
This is my car.
It's cute.
"No, it's a piece of crap."
Director Kim thinks that you and I look alike.
Who told you that?
The restaurant owner told me.
That man always talks crap.
Check your bank account.
Your money's back.
[WHISPERS] It's Georgina.
"[IN NORMAL VOICE] Georgina, where are you?"
What happened to Poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
"You got your money, that's all that matters."
- Now you can go to Yale.
"- Well, I'm going to NYU now."
"Oh, great."
Then I'll see you next year.
"Wait, what does that mean?"
[PHONE HANGS UP]
Wait-
- Hello?
Georgina?
What?
- Georgina Sparks?
"- Yes, that's right."
I recently enrolled in Gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
"Thank you, Ms. Sparks."
- Is there anything else?
- I'd like to request a roommate.
Blair Waldorf.
"She's my best friend, and I just can't wait to live with her."
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in Dubai?
You know you can't lose me for long.
Where you headed?
Everywhere.
- West Virginia?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
"Yes, talk me?"
Talk me?
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Mr. Klein.
Hello.
I want to speak with you.
Ok.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
I agree with you.
"You can taste the Silvaner grapes, the Muscat."
I can sense my old lady.
What's your old lady want?
She coming to the basement?
"You mean, if we stay too long?"
Really?
- She'll come?
"- Yeah, in a bikini."
In a bikini?
I'm gonna wait then.
I'll wait till she shows up.
Till she arrives in a bikini.
- This I want to see.
- Me too.
Will she dance for us?
"Sure, she'll dance."
She could get lost in such a big basement.
It's roomy enough.
- How long have you been married?
- An eternity.
- How long?
"- 25, 24 years."
What?
- 24 years.
- How much longer will she want you?
I can't say for sure.
We're heading down a long road.
She's built to last.
"So, I'll show you your future room."
Shut the door.
I'm a masochist.
- What?
- Yeah.
Positive now?
You're only nineteen.
- I'm twenty.
- You're only twenty.
I know what age I am.
Don't start getting snotty with me.
I should be getting snotty with you.
Sorry.
"It's shocking, that is."
What do you think?
- I don't know.
- That the best you can do?
"Well, what do you think?"
I don't know.
"I should give out, I suppose... or throw a wobbler or something... but what's the point?"
"I mean, if she was..."
You should have come to us earlier.
"Before, you know, when... said you were gonna get pregnant... then we could've done something about it."
My God.
"You're positive, now?"
Absolutely certain?
Shh.
"Molly, my Irish Molly"
Good girl.
What's that on your face?
Shaving foam.
Oh.
"Well, fair enough."
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Who was it?
- Was it?
"Fucking hilarious, he totally did you."
- Have they chucked him out?
- Doubt it.
"Not gonna chuck him out for that, just a scuffle."
- He kicked me in the cock.
- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.
- What?
"- They don't look twelve, to be fair."
"Fucking hell Si, you muppet."
We are so dead.
What?
Dead?
That should be the end of it!
"Simon's taken a beating, a child's honour's been restored."
- I didn't take a beating!
- Yeah.
This is Northwood.
"It's not the end, it's the start!"
- We do what now?
- I get Charlotte?
- Is she hard?
"- No, she'll get them thrown out!"
"I'll go find her, you go and hide somewhere."
- Hide?
"- Yes, hide."
- Toilets?
- Charlotte!
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
But it's no longer a Chinese's place.
It's a British colony now!
I don't care!
I won't let anyone bully me.
Alright.
Leave me alone!
"The salary which you haven't paid me, if it's convenient... may I get it back?"
What did you say?
The salary which you...
The previous line.
No.
"You told me to leave you alone, didn't you?"
Good!
Very good!
It's what you said!
"Master, you love chicken's kidney's very much."
Eat more.
More rice.
Let me do it...
"Master, your rice."
Don't you know I am on diet?
I want half rice!
Let me do it...
"Bastard, what a useless guy!"
Half!
"Look, half bowl of rice which you want!"
Eat it!
"You do this in my place, you are not giving me face, are you?"
You said you would leave me alone.
"You lost, Chan Mon-gut!"
Peace!
Peace!
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
I always get these things right!
No thanks.
"Yeah, no thanks."
"But, I really can tell the future!"
"Right, Saho?"
!
"You smell nice, Saho-san."
Ah!
That smell is incense.
I love it.
"The smell is great, and it is interesting to watch the smoke rise."
It makes me feel really relaxed.
Yeah!
I have been getting into incense lately myself!
Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!
"Oh man, Fumi!"
You really are doing whatever your teacher does!
Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?
Sorry for visiting you at such a busy time.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
"No, you're not a dog."
You're a great man!
We're outmoded characters.
We're outcasts.
I don't want to die like a dog.
"But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet."
I have one.
-Jeffrey!
"-Jenny, don't move!"
Don't leave me alone!
- What'll you do?
- Storm my way out!
"Don't kill anymore, please!"
Give up your guns and come with me.
What?
You saw me kill Sidney.
He was my best friend!
And you dare tell me to surrender?
"When Chang died, I swore I'd kill you."
But now I don't want you dead.
Get out of here withJenny.
How?
They'll chase me to the ends ofthe earth!
I have nowhere to go!
Get out there and say you're a cop.
See ifthey give up their guns!
Jenny!
Jeffrey!
Dumbo!
"Thanks, Mickey Mouse!"
I owe you.
You owe me nothing.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'.
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live.
"Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy."""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
Are you a cop or not?
Now you come up with this story and I'm supposed to believe you.
When was the last time you saw this girl?
He's putting them in the water so I'll find them.
- He wants me to find these girls.
"- You're crazy, that's it."
- He called me.
- He called you?
- That's right.
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.
- You dreamed it.
Get in your little boat and get the fuck out of here!
You're an alcoholic.
You need help.
- Get your head examined.
- Maybe you need a drink.
- It'd ease the pain of being wrong.
- Get out of my sight.
Keep those people out of here!
Am I talking to myself?
Put Grandpa back on.
Just a second.
She sounds good.
Yes.
"Okay, bye-bye."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Okay.
This is it. 16 months ago.
Metoo.
I hate when people are late.
Metoo.
I was the first to arrive at
Metoo.
I was the first to arrive at both parties I've attended.
I was the first to arrive at both parties I've attended.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
both parties I've attended.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
It's funny.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
It's funny.
Joke.
"Ican'tbelieveI'm  saying this, but I think they might actually--"
Holycrow.
"Well, I did tell her."

You lost your hair.
- Yes all.
Your beautiful hair.
- But you found your belly.
"Oh, my friend."
My crazy brother.
Who are these people?
- My crew.
"Nicky, the sound engineer."
"Carlos, operator help."
"Our manufacturer, Ludo."
"And Louise, my assistant."
- Hello.
"Boys, this is a special man and my dear friend."
What are you doing here?
Let's make a program about Turkey entering Europe.
"Excuse me, are the phones working here in Serbia?"
Where is she from?
- From Belgium.
Belgium?
"Maybe he does not know, but his country is a coat."
"Yes, we know it."
- What a pity.
You are at the center of Europe and you do not know how to keep your mini-country together.
Nor is his country a good example.
"Ignore, Dragan."
"- He is right, I like it."
"We are mythical matter, Lady Louise."
The Balkans are the Balkans.
There is love.
I hate it.
It's love.
Where are they?
- You can't just barge in here!
- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
Keep your eye on the prize jenny humphrey.
You can't make people love you
But you can make them fear you.
For what it's worth
You're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
It's already been over an hour.
The bar's closing soon.
She's gonna come.
I know she is.
Whoa Whoa whoa.
Wait.

Dan is gossip girl?
Gossip girl?
You crazy?
Then what are you doing here?
I loopt you.
Are you waiting for gossip girl?
And I know you don't approve.
I'm gonna go close the tab.
This grudge match thing--
It d--it doesn't seem like you.
What's--what's going on?
I don't want to be irrelevant.
Irrelevant?

"It was dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
Your brother and me -- we needed you.
"You walked away, Sam."
- You walked away!
"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
Slut!
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
Leave me alone.
I just mean...
"I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
You're sorry?
"And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil?"
"No, you don't, dear."
No.
"The great warning-off of May 8th, yes."
"Good old Saint George, eh, Major?"
"Well, he killed a hideous fire-breathing old dragon, didn't he?"
"Ran it through with a lance, I believe."
Mr. Fawlty!
Mr. Fawlty!
Is Missus...
room no like.
She want speak to you.
Is problem.
"Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?"
"Why... why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?"
"I don't know, Major."
Better than marrying it.
Marrying it?
"But he didn't have to kill it, though, did he?"
"I mean, he could've, uh, just not turned up at the church."
"Good morning, Madam."
Can I help you?
- Are you the manager?
"- I am the owner, Madam."
- What?
- I am the owner.
I want to speak to the manager.
"- I am the manager, too."
- What?
I am the manager as well.
Manaher.
He manaher.
Please listen to me.
I'm a doctor.
I'm on your side.
I'm on the president's side.
I can tell you where the guerrilleros are.
I saw them marching towards San Juan.
We'll see about that.
Call the Capitán.
- Come on!
"- Hurry, over there."
We need more material.
Hurry up.
"You need to work faster, come on."
Unit 3!
There's someone lying there.
Let's see if he's still alive.
Careful.
There's another one down there.
Fire!
There are even more of them!
Come over here!
I always come at the right time.
Where's Smithy?
He stayed down there.
I lost sight of him.
It all happened so fast.
- Do you think he's dead?
"- If he isn't, I hope they won't get him."
"- Come on, get up there."
- Hurry up.
Come on.
I wonder what your father would have said about this ruckus.
"Yes, of my aunt, by the one of the rent."
"One does not worry about the rent, we can reach an agreement."
That is what worries me.
By the way.
"It has called a friend of yours, a certain Sandro."
"He has said that it is very urgent, must call to him immediately."
I have pointed its number here.
-I can use your telephone?
"-Please, you can use everything you want."
-The hand.
-It pardons.
"yes, whats up."
"Benito, you must save me, you must help me."
My belly.
What?
Higher speech.
I do not hear you.
"I need the wee-wee the 22, the one of Sandokan, is urgent."
What?
wee-wee?
wee-wee?
!
Why I serve the wee-wee to you?
Wee-wee Why I serve to you?
For the analyses.
It dates haste.
Disgusting.
"Ah, for the analyses."
"The 22, Sandokan."
"Yes, in agreement."
Sandro.
Sandro.?
"You know, i thought it might be him."
Oh.
"Well, what happened?"
Did you come to any conclusions about anything while you were out?
Mmm.
"I'm okay, ma."
I'm really okay.
- You sure?
Talk to me.
- I...
I just feel like...
Remember saul on the road to damascus.
Of course.
I used to read you that story.
Do you remember when god struck him and he went blind?
- Yes.
Yes.
- He went blind for three days
"And then when he came back,"
You remember how he saw the error of his ways?
"Mm-Hmm, yes."
"Well, i was running today..."
- Mm-Hmm.
- ...and i was trying to clear my head.
"I was trying to hear from god, mama..."
- Oh.
- ...and i just started looking at people going by.
I saw this mother.
She was playing with her kids.
She was pushing her child on the swing.
"And, mama, that..."
The mother looked like
"I, uh..."
"And I did one recently that was so big, when I..."
What was the question again?
The question was about...
LAUGHTER
I mean...
"I tell you who misheard, David O'Doherty."
LAUGHTER
"And he was like, ""Oh, that's a sweet job"
"""you've done there,"" you know?"
LAUGHTER
"OK, top thing people get jealous about."
People that can spell definitely.
LAUGHTER
Ohh...
"I've got D-E-F - after that, I've got nothing left in the locker."
LAUGHTER
That's why defo was invented.
Defo.
LAUGHTER
New girlfriends or new boyfriends.
"Yeah, that's a good answer, yeah."
It's that sort of area.
"Flirting, flirting."
Flirting with...
Yeah.
Flirting is exactly it.
Ahh.
APPLAUSE
"Yes, the top thing people get jealous about is their partner flirting."
I'm a bit of a flirt.
"Just last night, I had a girl give me a look that left me in no doubt as to what she wanted."
You killed Jerry the bookie with a bat?
It's not like a half mil is gonna hurt you with that lottery ticket.
"- Get me the money, Russ."
- Ohh!
"Great, Gig."
We gotta talk about this.
"I'll fuckin' ball-bat you, you creep cock sucker."
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
[ Coughing ]
- Mint Listerine?
- Yeah.
- When did they come out with this?
- I don't know.
- Is it good?
"- Yeah, it's good."
[ Tires Screeching ]
"Look, just give this Dale guy a little extra money."
- It's better than losing it all.
- Better than being dead too.
"Crystal, he hits people with commemorative bats!"
He's not gonna hit you with a bat.
He's your friend.
- What?
- Wanna see the jacket i got?
He's not my friend.
I just met this guy.
How can he be my f -
- Look - $900.
- [Sighs]
Made in Italy.
I'm not screwing around anymore.
"No, it's pretty good, hon."
"- Well, I -"
- No plate.
- No?
- No.
No knives and forks either.
I understand you're supposed to dig in.
"0h, allow me to show you, will you?"
You use only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand.
"You don't use the other two fingers, and always the left hand in the lap."
"- (McKenna) 0h, I see."
- May I show you?
"- Ju-Just these two fingers, huh?"
- l'll hold it for you.
- See.
- There we are.
"Well, I, uh... uh..."
"Boy, could I use this hand."
"- l can't, uh..."
- lt's alright.
- lt's good stuff.
- No one minds.
"- lt's messy, but worth it."
- l'll practise on an olive.
"0h, honey, it's wonderful."
Here.
Take a bite.
- Good?
- Yeah.
"Tell me - does this way of eating have to do with religion, or something?"
I think it's more social than religious.
I don't know.
"It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before..."
"Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay."
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty."
"Goodbye, Mr. Firkin."
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly."
Right?
"Yes, good luck!"
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
"Morning, Major."
"Good morning, Fawlty."
"Yes, dear?"
"What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?"
"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.
(THUDDING)
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'll see each other again
- real soon.
- (CAR STARTS)
If you're gonna stay here you gotta keep better track of yourself.
Sheesh.
"Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know, a bedtime story or something."
I've got some really cool ones.
"MAD Magazine, (LAUGHS) very funny."
"The Spirit, very cool."
Boy's Life...
Ehh...
"Oh, here."
This guy is Superman.
"Sure, he's famous now,"
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not like you.
You're a good guy.
Like Superman.
Superman.
(STOMACH GROWLS)
"- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?"
"Look, he's been through a lot."
"Just don't break his heart, OK?"
"Oh, my God!"
I just...
You know...
Wh...
What can I say to you to make you understand that we are not together?
"You know, if you don't believe me, you can ask..."
Ask my boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?
"- Yes, I do."
It's a very serious...
I love him.
"I'm sorry, I..."
I guess it was just a misunderstanding.
Mm.
- I'll let you settle in.
"- Yeah, OK."
And please feel free to spread the word.
No.
Listen to this.
"""Spend two weeks at a sixteenth century Tuscan farmhouse."
"Each night, you prepare an authentic Italian meal learning from local chefs."""
Wow.
Interested?
Two weeks cooking?
"What part of ""vacation"" do you not understand?"
- Are you expecting a fax?
"- Well, no."
"I mean, yes."
I am.
My papers from my office.
"- Oh, you don't?"
- No.
"Well, how would you say it?"
I don't know.
I'd call her up and ask her to a dance.
Or a movie?
"Yeah, or a movie and we'd go and get something to eat."
Or drink?
"No, not any girl I'd propose to."
"Oh, I see."
"Well, go on."
"Well, then when the time came, I guess I'd hold her hand."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Then what would you say?
I'd say:
"""Betty, I'm crazy about you."
"Will you marry me?"""
"Well, let me think."
"Yes, Ed, I guess I will."
"- Well, then we're engaged."
- I think that's what they call it.
Oh.
"- It's swell, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
"Hey, what will your mother say?"
"She'll probably say, ""Thank, heavens. """
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
How you like the sodas?
"- Okay, Nick, take it out of there."
Is she my daughter?
Of course not.
She is mine and Jørgen's.
What were you thinking?
- Is she my daughter?
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I asked you a question!
- I'll call you tomorrow!
Won't you come to bed?
"- Why did you do it, Jørgen?"
- Do what?
"I didn't know it was him, Helene."
It's just too much of a coincidence.
- He shouldn't have come.
- No.
But we can't control everything in the world.
"Hi, it's 602 again."
Do I have any messages now?
Fine.
Thanks.
- That's nice.
- Let me have a look?
- It's got small swastikas on it.
- They're not swastikas.
It's wonderful.
It's from...
- It's from Allan and Kristina.
- One of our really good lawyers.
"He'll be fired for giving such an ugly vase, right?"
- Put it over there.
- It goes in the basement.
I have to talk to Helene.
Where is it...?
Where is it...?
Show me!
- ...
"Jesus Christ, dude...!"
- ...
What...?
You explain that to his mom...
That's okay...
"She's not going to tell her mom on us, is she...?"
"She fell down on the playground, that's all..."
Right?
Right...?
"Say it, little girl..."
"Say it... come on, dude..."
Let's go...
I fell down...
...On the playground.
"Well you have to be more careful, Okay honey?"
I don't like to see my baby hurt...

Are you reading this?
"It's for school, it's boring c'mon, look...!"
It's so cool...!
We can talk to each other...!
Through the wall...!
Can you hear me through the wall?
...Only sometimes..
Did you hear anything the other night...?
why was your dad so mad...?
Where's your mom...?
You're one of those rich computer twins.
Otto recoded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood.
You brought me back to save you.
Otto:
The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated.
[Gunshot]
"You hang on, all right?"
You hang on!
I should have gone to your ball games.
I should have...
I should have been better to your mom.
Duval:
He's dying.
He said you could fix him.
I'll meet you at the gate.
"No, we're coming in together."
No more lies.
Why does he think he's my father?
Because he is.
No.
"No, no, no, no."
"No, it can't be."
It is.
It is not.
It's impossible.
This doesn't happen.
It...
it... it never happens.
"If by ""it"" you mean me, it's happened."
Look at me.
You know who I am.
- Shut up.
Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

"This guy, Stenz.."
made multiple calls to a secure line in D. C..
but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.
Really?
Did you check Walker's personal records?
"His computer, his emails?"
"You don't know Walker, John."
He was a dinosaur.
The man still used a pager.
"Oh, shit."
Listen.
"Carol, I got to check something out."
We'll see you outside.
I don't believe it.
"I think I know how Walker got the codes, but I'm gonna need your help, sir."
Move back!
Move back.
Emily.
"Oh, baby, you okay?"
"Oh, thank God."
"Thank God, baby."
Did you see my routine?
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
"You were beautiful, baby."
You saved us.
You know that?
"Hey, stay with Mommy for a second, okay?"
We just got back off tour.
"- You had a band, didn't you?"
- We're Silicone Valets.
"- You didn't teach these Flop Idols, did you?"
"- Yeah, tried to."
For me sins.
"- Too rebellious to teach, us."
"Weren't we, Miss?"
- No.
Just too thick.
"- Do us a quarter, will ya, Moz?"
"- Oh, two quarters for me."
Cheers.
"Quarters, eh?"
You are doing well.
"Oh, yeah."
Now who's thick?
Keep the change.
"Well, you completely cleared me out."
I'm gonna have to have a major restock.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Ah, well, better get back."
- Nice to see you both.
- Yeah.
"Oh, actually this is our first EP."
"It's called ""Exhibit A""."
Thanks.
"Hope the teaching works out, Miss."
"Yeah, I know I couldn't handle a load of kids screaming' at me every day."
"No, 'cause that's for successful bands, i'nt it?"
Bye.
"All right, fella?"
Chah Bahar targeted.
Confirm Chah Bahar.
Go!
"Leave, leave, leave!"
"No, no!"
Not without my dad!
"Go, go, go!"
Your little bitch says you're gonna put me in jail!
"Come on, Martin."
This isn't you.
You protected presidents for the past 25 years.
What are you gonna do?
You really gonna shoot me?
All right.
Yes.
He deserved it.
You killed him!
Get back.
Get over here.
Get in the room or I'll knock you out!
And do as you're told.
"Go on, sit down!"
I'm gonna carve my name on your chest!
"No jail for you, you little bitch!"
No!
No!
Get it off!

We can't talk here.

Why not?
Count to 15 before you follow me.
"Second thought, make that 20."
Brent!
I said 20.
What has gotten into you?
You've become a cub scout?
No.
These two fingers represent the pause button.
On our friendship.
What?
River Rock Publishing is in the middle of a cold war.
"I'm America, and you're the USSR."
That's ridiculous.
Crossing enemy lines is a mistake.
It complicates things.
"Oh, Brent, come on."
This is crazy.
How long can you two keep this up?
Don't blame me.
Blame Julianne.

An error in the dimension subroutine.
Somewhere here.

I simply will not be beaten.

"I can get the molding off, and I think that's the way to go."

Are you all right in there?
"Well, we got a little problem here, but"
"I""ll get you out."
"Just stay calm in there, remember, most accidents happen in the home."
There it is.
I don't believe that they use doors like this.
I'll get you out.
As easy as pie.

"Yes, everything is set."
I'll take a plane and go straight to Budapest.
From there I'll go to the embassy and then I'll come to get you.
"Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the water."

"See, the author explains that title there in the introduction."
"That's what they used to call him when he was a kid. ""Hey, Fat!"""
"He got so mad that he set about as his life's work to make himself skinny, and it worked."
That's a picture of him on the back cover.
- Where?
- Right there.
"If he writes another book, he should title it Hey Corpse."
"Okay, gang."
"Why don't we gather around, and... drink a toast to the birthday boy here."

Bob.
Okay.
"- Okay, ready?"
- Ready.
Here's to Bob Hartley.
We wanna see more of him...
- but we hope we see less.
- I get it.
I get it.
"- Cheers, cheers."
"- Cheers, cheers."
Cheers.
Look at that.
Aren't you going to drink your water?
Back to work.
"Hey, Kelli Ann."
Did I get any calls?
"Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no."
Not a lot of phone traffic.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
What's her name?
Who?
"The girl, Alex."
There's no girl.
"You can't hide it, man."
I know strung out and you are strung out.
"Okay, please."
KELLI ANN:
This is amazing.
"You can't focus, right?"
"Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your e-mail 100 times a day wishing you could write songs."
"No, feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations."
"It's always the same and it has happened to you, my friend."
Shit.
"Welcome to my world, asshole."
Let me get the door.
Sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli?
I gotta finish this stuff.
Okay.
- Yeah.
So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Okay.
Pen perfect?
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's very...
Buckley.
It's not your fault in there.
Really isn't.
I better go home.
So...
Exterior train station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole school of dialog.
On and on and on and on and on.
Lose half.
Which half?
I forgot mine...
Please...?
Give me the fucking keys!
Thanks!
"- See you at home, little girl..."
- Hey!
- Shut up!
- But I didn't say anything!
Shut up!
"Abby, I did it!"
You did what...?
They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital I almost got suspended.
But I did it.
What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen Yeah?
- Hey...
You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
"""ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH"""
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.
This this kid who used to live in the building.
Tommy.
"He would come down here and drink and smoke with his high school friends, and.."
"And when they weren't here, He would play ping-pong with me."
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
Looking for a room.
"My mother ain't here, but the lady in number two will show you the rooms."
Yes?
Yes?
I'm looking for a room.
Mrs. Maggione's kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes.
I'll get the key.
Third floor.
There's something about your face that looks awfully familiar.
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
"- No, really."
"Listen, sister, all I'm looking for is a room."
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it a good cleaning.
- It's all right.
I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.
- I'll take the room.
What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.
- Sold.
- In advance.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
How did you happen to come to this house?
"Looking for references, huh?"
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
"Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish."
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
He saved Ben.
- We're his parents.
How is he?
- It's too soon.
- The news said his heart stopped.
- It's going now.
- How's he doing?
- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.
- Thank God for small miracles.
- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.
- Heated pleural lavage?
His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.
- That'd be fastest.
What do you think?
- You're the Attending.
Call Cardiac Surgery for a perfusionist with a bypass pump and a heating unit.
"Lily, go get Benton."
- Mark needs you for bypass access.
- Got to stop the bleeding first.
Thoracotomy tray.
Now!
- We'll go to the waiting room.
"- No, I wanna stay."
"No, we have to go."
It's from Laverne.
"- Corporal, can I have my letter, please?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Here, Father."
- Oh.
[Moaning] Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
"- Good morning, Klinger."
"- Good morning, darling."
"- Come again, snookums?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"I'm sorry, sir."
It's a letter from Laverne.
Laverne... the ex-missus who left you high and dry for that butcher boy?
Morty's a sausage maker.
That's below butcher in the Toledo social register.
"But everything's changed now, sir."
Listen to what I read so far.
"""Dear Maxie, You are much in my mind these days."
"""Taking up with Morty was a terrible mistake."
"The man's soul is made of animal by-products."""
"Guess that makes you feel pretty happy, huh?"
- Seeing the sausage king put through the old grinder.
"- It's more than that, sir."
Can't you read between the lines?
She wants me back.
"Oh, that's music to my eyes!"
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
Good night.
"John, you knew that."
Quite some time has passed.
Therapy How's it going?
"- Now I'm a new man, Father."
- I can see that.
- House is sold?
- No.
"Satmalısın House, John."
You have to continue life.
"Which hayatmış this, Father?"
- God works in mysterious ways.
- Now it is doing?
I can not understand.
Why?
Why come here at You're bothered that the candles burning?
- Because he would have done.
"- Anna would have done, because he believed."
"- Flame, a symbol of his faith believed that."
- Yes.
Well ...
I also drink it.
"Sometimes I'm thinking, God, I have chosen, or Does God he chose me."
"Because if he opted me, the error could have done."
"Hey, Father."
It relaxes you a little bit.
- Then I will see you on Sunday?
- No ...
- My mom says I vereceklermiş a medal.
I'm very proud of.
"- I'll be safe, John."
"I love you, Daddy."
Turn him away from me.
Keep up with me.
You can move faster than that.
"Yo, Tino!"
"- Hey, how you doing?"
- What's going on?
I got something for you.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
"Hey, Tino."

I've always wanted to see this place.
"Yeah, I guess it's a bit much."
Heh.
"Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice."
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
These are great.
That's just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.

Come with me.
"So the thing about cherries, you have to..."

Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.

Not until you tell me what's going on.

Okay.

- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing withoutJeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care ofJenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
Hey!
Don't shoot!
It's me!
Somebody's aiming at my ass from below!
What happened?
Where'sJeffrey?
I know you both lied to me.
Tell me the truth!
Ow!
Stop!
Ow!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ow!
-
- What's going on?
-
"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
"- Yes, it was."
"Well, at least Jo seems well."
- I kissed him on the ear.
- Perhaps if you had another?
Why ever not?
Surely David's capable?
Yes.
But he can't bear to pass me in the hallway for fear of touching me.
"- Come on, Lucy."
- I do love you.
It's not necessary to tell Father about this.
- No.
- No.
"Come on, then."
"- Bye-bye, Grandma."
"- Come along, Jo."
Agent Muller.
- Someone's in with Muller.
- Good.
Give them 60 seconds and then go in.
You've left a trail a blind man could follow.
We're surrounded.
Speak in English.
The Führer wants you to... reassess the strength of Patton's army in East Anglia.
It's invasion strength.
They have the photographs.
General Patton is ready to invade Europe at any time at Pas-de-Calais.
- Hitler's astrologer...
- Astrologer?
My God.
He believes... attack will be at Normandy.
All right.
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
But it's...
"Look at it, it's..."
"Go on, say it, most people do."
It's smaller on the outside!
"OK, that is a first."
Is it magic?
Is it a machine?
It's a ship.
A ship?
Best ship in the universe.
Is there a kitchen?
Another first.
"I don't know why I asked that, it's just..."
I like making souffles.
Souffles?
!
Why are you showing me all this?
"You followed me, remember"
- I didn't invite you.
You're nearly a foot taller than I am.
You could've reached the ladder without this - you took it for me.
Why?
I never know why.
I only know who.
What's this?
Me.
Giving in.
I don't know why I'm crying...
I do.
"Remember this - this right now, remember all of it."
"Because this is the day, this is the day, this is the day everything begins."
Clara!
It's not just a game.
Not to me.
I can see that.
"Where were you a week ago, Monday, sir?"
"A week ago, Monday."
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
"Uh, excuse me?"
I was here.
Like always.
Watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
"Do you own a pair of scissors, Mr. O'Dwyer?"
Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please?"
How about some metallic paint?
Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Marissa Kessler?
"Well, you do have her picture up all over the wall."
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lotto girls."
Jackpot winners.
People who work there.
Secretaries.
Gaffers.
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I publish a newsletter.
A lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
"None of my business, but I know you and Bradfield were..."
He really liked you.
Anyone could see that.
Like I said... none of my business.
"When I mentioned Clifford Bentley, that last fella spat on the floor."
Right.
This is it.
Reggie Barker.
How would David move the body on his own?
I've seen a wife butcher a husband twice her size.
You'd be surprised what people are capable of when shit hits the fan.
Not long before evening drinking.
Someone should be in.
Open up!
Police.
I can see you!
Idiot.
Sarge?
Stay there.
Make sure no one comes out.
"Reggie Barker, is it?"
"- Where are you going, mate?"
- I don't want no trouble.
- The Bentley boy's upstairs.
- David's here?
Yeah.
Stinking the place out with that bloody stuff.
"Is his old man here, as well?"
- He's CID.
- So?
So I don't want no part of this.
- Help me move him.
"It was hot, you wouldn't believe."
And dressed completely in black...
"In the supermarket, you can ask my wife..."
Him in shorts.
"carrying his son, behind him wife and daughter dressed head to toe in black."
- Leaving a trail of sweat behind...
- The smell was horrible.
People who deny it... lie to themselves.
Or they are simply stupid.
- They are centuries...
- They've had bad experiences...
They are centuries behind.
- 500 years.
- 300.
Sweetheart.
My little baby.
My Emmi mouse.
You little darling.
"You're so big now, you can hug Mommy."
That feels so good.
Little sweetheart.
My sweet little mouse.
My teeny-tiny sweet little mouse.
We don't want you to get cold.
You're my pretty princess in white.
My princess.
I'm so happy I have you.
Mommy's always with you.
Mommy always comes.
That's right.
"Hello, I'm home."
"Yeah, what is it?"
What have you done?
"""The lovers moustache tickles"", doesn't it?"
I've shaved it!
I can see what you want.
"You misunderstand, sir!"
This is... a cross-connection!
What?
Let me put it plainly.
What you are dreaming of can never be true!
But what are you scared of?
Wouldn't you be scared if a man proposed to you?
It's wrong.
Cancel it!
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?
Hart's my husband.
"But he's Godbole, isn't he?"
True but I'm married!
Obviously.
But you never spoke of it.
I thought...
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.
You just thrust a rose in my hand.
What could I do?
!
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!
What if he does?
In that case I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?
We gotta go
(Door closing)
"Coming to the stage, from the BX."
(Cheering and clapping)
"Please welcome, the one, the only..."
Vanessa!
(Cheering and applauding)
"It cracks and clicks and the glass it rips to pieces,"
Too sharp.
I sometimes slip between the creases
I been building out your weakness.
(Woman) Wow.
Brow and bone structure bent to your likeness.
I like this.
Live in the middle with a piece of mind.
Make like a mirror and turn me lovely.
"Face to face, and say you love me."
(Woman) Yes!
(Woman) Yes!
(Crowd cheering) Yes!
"(Woman) Aw ma, you did your thing up there."
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Let me talk to you for a second?
"Okay, you have one second... go."
"So I'm saying, I think you look mad sexy."
You here with somebody?
Yeah.
"All right, that's cool, ma."
I'm kidding.
I'm here with my friends.
"Got you, got you."
Do you think I'm a magician?
New York City is a big place.
How am I supposed to find Alex Bohemia?
Kind of like finding a penguin in a sandstorm.
You sure you got the right address?
You boys think this is Atlantic City?
"Jeremy, pick up your milk money and get inside!"
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for-
"You're in the wrong neighborhood, man!"
I'm looking for a family.
Maybe-
Wack accent!
"You way out of your 'hood, white boy."
You crazy or what?
Or maybe you're a cop?
Hey!
"Get the hell out from my building, you little shits!"
"Come on, old man!"
He's the chump.
- Thank you.
- Chump.
Thanks.
They're not scared of you.
They don't know who you are.
- They're supposed to be scared?
- Everybody supposed to be scared of you.
- Why?
- Why?
Please!
Big-time gangster like you!
Rich.
- Do you have many rooms?
"- Yeah, we do."
Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.
"I'll think about it, and come back later."
Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.
"Okay, let's go together."
"Yeah, let's."
Hwasung Rest Area
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.
"- Potatoes, large size, please."
"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
"The drunkard has tattled, has he?"
Not him.
Producer Ranbir Kapoor told me his.
"Does he know about it, too?"
Of course.
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.
"In the newspapers, too?"
Yes.
I've sent the news!
You're not an assistant director anymore.
You've been promoted.
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an independent choreographer!
What a cold reaction!
No!
It means the same!
Won't you reward me for the good news I've brought?
What do you want?
Don't you remember?
No!
This won't do!
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?
Yes.
That's how you hurt your own feet!
So let's go...
Okay...
"I mean, I've got to go to the loo!"
But aunty's using it now.
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!
When must I come again?
When I'm not around
If I told them everything they'd never let me go out.
Baby... come on.
"Simon, we've got to talk."
"Simon, look at me!"
- You are always watching porn.
"- Just go, OK?"
It was only porn.
It didn't mean anything.
I did it for us.
You are dead to me.
- You look like a worn-out corn hole.
- Simon just dumped me.
- You were hooked on each other.
- It was the porn mag.
He's always jerking off to porn.
Men can be real creeps.
"Take this, baby."
- What is it?
- X.
- I can't swallow pills.
- You can't use that for diddly shit.
Now swallow.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Come on, they're playing our song."
Whoever finishes first wins the pile.
"- That's a lot of coke, Marc."
- A gram each.
That's nothing.
- On the count of three.
"- I'II wipe you out, faggot!"
- You're history.
"- Three, two, one, GO!"
"- I'm sure you do, Mr. O'dwyer."
- It's not just a game.
Not to me.
- I can see that.
"- Where were you a week ago monday, sir?"
A week ago monday.
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
- Excuse me?
- I was here.
Like always... watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
- Do own a pair of scissors Mr. O'dwyer?
- Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please."
- How about some metallic paint?
- Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Melissa Kessler?
You do have her picture up all over the wall?
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lottery girls."
The jackpot winners.
People who work there.
"Secretaries, gaffers."
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
"I, publish a newsletter."
Lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
What's this?
You're gonna get in trouble.
No.
"- Oh, give me some room."
"- No, Ponch."
Don't do it.
"She's my project for the month, remember?"
How about Miss Trailer Park?
Legs up to here?
Remember?
"A bird in the hand, my boy, a bird in the hand."
"Good morning, my lovely."
"Not now, Ponch."
Sarge needs these reports.
Saturday night they got a great double bill at the drive-in.
Some of us stopped going to drive-ins when we graduated from high school.
- Accurately you calculate your gas...
"This is a drive-in movie and a picnic, all in one date."
- It's really far-out.
- Poncherello.
"Think it over, I make a terrific potato salad."
Ponch.
"We did good today, babe."
"Yeah, let's celebrate."
Let's get back to the campground.
Far out.
Today has got to be our day.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
It's almost time.
Yeah.
For what?
Lunch?
No.
-Come on!
-Let's go!
Bring Sandra back to her room first.
Why?
Is there a problem?
I'm pregnant.
I had my check up with Dr. Gamboa.
It's already 7 weeks old.
I'm having such a hard time.
Your husband will come back to you!
So stop crying now.
Stop crying.
"When his memory comes back, who else will he come home to?"
What if his memory doesn't come back?
"Whatever pain was caused by your relationship with Migs, it also has beautiful memories."
"And most of all, stop pleading or begging on that Bela."
Her conscience will haunt her more if you have no connection.
Do you still love Migs?
.
Yes.
I love Migs so much.
You have to wait for him to get better.
"Migs, stop it!"
Come on!
-Why?
I used to do that.
-No.
Oh!
"Wait, I forgot something."
-I'll come back.
-Okay then.
What?
What is Cock or Balls?
"It's like Rock paper scissors, except you stand back-to-back, unzip your fly, pull out a little bit of skin, and the other guy has to guess whether he's looking at your cock or your balls."
Best two-out-of-three wins.
Somebody wins?
[Eddie] [groans] I'll go first.
[clears throat]
"If I win, you gotta face Cassie."
"Okay, and if I win, you shut the fuck up about that book."
Deal.
"Wait, y'all actually about to play this shit?"
No peeking.
No need.
I can draw a courtroom sketch of his dick.
"All right, ready?"
"Yeah, did you find it?"
"Three, two, one."
- Balls.
- Fuck!
Every time.
[Ron's zipper opens]
- You all right back there?
- Yep.
Whew!
Okay.

What do you think of that?
"Yeah, drink it in."
Why are you so fucking close?

How long have we been mates?
"Well, I don't know."

"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
Why don't you love me anymore?
Why don't you love me anymore?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
"Look, Terry..."
"Look, Terry..."
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
He says that it is your job to answer the tough questions.
"You owe it to me, to the marriage, to confess everything."
- Pastor Paul...
- This is where we did it.
Can you believe I brought her here?
The same place we were married?
Pastor Paul says we should confess our sins.
Let the confessing begin.
"Make a list, will you, honey?"
Cheated on Clara.
Cheated on Lisa.
Here.
Clara:
Controlling.
Go ahead.
Lisa:
She likes for me to make the decisions.
"Let""s see."
Clara spends too much money.
"Lisa""s broke, but she""s not afraid to ask for help."
She likes for a man to take care of her.
"Lisa is tiny, or petite."
Clara is a big...
- thick person.
- Fat.
You had a great body when we were married.
You just got to work out a little.
Clara has pretty eyes.
"Well, they are."
"They""re beautiful, honey."
They are.
"Lisa, her body""s fit."
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.
- You what?
- Yeah.
- You're not pregnant?
- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.
- I wanna set up a nursery.
- No.
I were gonna call it...
Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I need to be there.
"- Hiya, Moz."
"- All right, Alex?"
How you doing?
Just on me lunch break.
"Thought I'd pop in, get a little bit mashed."
"- You still teaching at secondary school, then?"
"- Yeah, for me sins."
Felix.
"Run,run,run!"
"Go,baby!"
"Go, go, go!"
"Go to second, go to second!"
"Go, baby, go!"
"Go to third, go to third, ziggy!"
"Go, babe!"
"Run, run, run!"
Home run!
Home run!
Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
You have to see the view.
Join this road.
"Gentlemen, this is our research department."
We are proud of what we gained through research.
"Yes, here is Frederik Jackman and Tonje Sandvik."
Tonje Sandvik our research leader.
Is that you?
Aksel god.
Do you know me again?
-Yes.
Of course.
-Here's Report.
-It's Not necessary.
But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.
OK.
"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."
"Eva, listen to me."
PWG is the only card we have.
"In a few days the deal is done, and so you'll never have to see him again."
-What do you mean?
-Drag Back.
Hear what they have to say
He will not getting buy a single share.
-So You'd rather go bankrupt?
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
Jimmy you don't understand anything.
What I don't understand anything is why anybody would want to take your picture.
That's what I don't understand.
You're just a freak.
A weirdo.
Behind your back everybody laughs.
They call you chicken woman.
That's why you look just like her.
Such a sweet point.
"Don't step on that shoe, we'll have to pay for it."
C'mon!
C'mon!
One day the chicken woman had chicks.
"And everybody stepped on, cause they were so ugly..."
Don't talk to her like that.
We still have two rolls of film.
Old Mac Donald had a farm E...
I...
E...
I...
O and on his farm he had some chicken.
E...
I...
E...
I...
O
"With a chick, chick here and a chick, chick there"
"Here a chick...chick there, Chick Everywhere a chick chick"
Old Mac Donald had a farm E...
I...
E...
I...
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"I sleep here, eat here."
I am here... got that?
I'll go with you.
The way I look they'll never believe I am gay.
Make me a Zenne.
Some cream?
"Oh, you speak German?"
My ex-husband was from Bavaria.
I lived in Munich for many years.
How did you like Bavaria?
I don't know.
I didn't really feel at home.
"The people... but now, I miss it very much."
Bavaria is beautiful.
I hope Ahmet will enjoy it there with me.
What are you doing?
Take this!
Stand in line.
"Hey, I wanna meet him."""
"And Kat's like, ""All right, I'll go introduce you."
"Come on."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- I never met him either.
Andy was talking to somebody and then Kat goes:
"- ""Andy, this is Ari."""
"- Oh, man, that is so funny."
- Great.
- I couldn't help it.
"This is at The Box, which is an amazing space."
This was amazing.
This was...
Yes.
Yes.
- This was a really fun day.
- They did that how many times?
Like 10?
"Upwards of 10 probably, right?"
- Yeah.
- This is one of my favorite days.
"We're all, like, hanging out in there."
- My parents were here this day.
"- Yeah, your parents were there."
I love everybody's different faces.
Look at this.
Bewildered.
"This was originally slow motion, right?"
Or I guess we shot it regular.
"It was, but we realized the song wasn't long enough for us to play it in slow motion."
- Right.
"Oh, man."
It was a bit rushed.
I could do better.
Ok.
That's good.
"Sarah, that's really good."
"And Debbie's actually one of my favorite models necause she's so flexible, and she moves in really interesting ways, you know?"
"So, what do you do with that now?"
Oh...nothing.
It's just an exercise.
You mind if I keep that?
Thanks.
Yeah.
"You know, you really should've gone to art school."
"What is this, a mid-life crisis or something?"
Do you have cancer?
"No, no."
"No, no."
"Well, then what?"
Art school?
That's what I should do?
I thought it was Commerce or...
"Pre-med or I'm ""on my own."""
I said that?
Ah.
"Well, I wish I hadn't."
"I mean, I know that doesn't really help."
It helps a little.
Well...
"I had a really nice time today, Sarah."
"Yeah, me, too."
Good.
Take care of yourself.
"Working freelance, you must always do good work."
Or be jobless before you know it.
I know I suck.
C'mon.
Think on the bright side.
At least during New Year this time you can relax at home like everyone else.
It will be a new experience for you.
"Anyway, I got to go."
I got a briefing.
Bye.
Happy holidays.
You ready to be happy for once?
From today lots of people start traveling home.
And plan to travel around here and abroad.
"Only the first day, I'm already going insane."
Damn I'd die for a job now.
Your mail sir.
Happy New Year son.
"Stay healthy, and take good care of yourself."
Mom.
PS.
"The photo I asked you to retouch, when will I get it?"
"It's not that kind of work, mom."
Shoot Je!
Shoot what?
Umm...
What's up?
I'm off to Japan.
You want anything?
You?
To Japan?
To do what?
"I guess that would've been structural letdown, huh?"
You know this place?
Yeah. it's a fleabag hotel.
"They say that Bret Easton Ellis, he got drunk... and he threw up in a flag tree."
The thing won't stop growing.
They got to keep trimming it.
- Just relax.
- He's a very good writer.
Just relax.
Thanks.
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.
Walt.
We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
Sometimes it's just a bit monotonous.
Just a tiny bit dull.
"Hi, Claire."
"Frank, come here."
Have a look.
- Frank!
- Marvelous.
- Look at this.
It's a Torben Din.
- Very nice.
"- 25,000 kroner."
It's a steal.
- It is?
"- Yes, it's worth at least 30-40,000."
- I have to go help out the Gimp.
- He's putting Bodil in a home.
"- Well, good for him."
You just can't eat a thing around a mentally handicapped person.
- He's skin and bone.
- Why can't he eat?
- You can't eat around those people.
- Why not?
It turns you off food when fellow human beings are barmy.
I've never heard that before.
- You haven't?
- No.
- Mia said I was speaking for myself.
- I've never heard anyone think that.
I shagged a handicapped girl once.
I shagged a retard.
- But you can't.
A real retard?
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
Thanks.
You and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
Sunsets are really pretty.
Maybe we will.
Dead man walking.
Hi.
Hello.
Can I come in?
There's a front door.
I wanted to see you.
This is quicker.
What happened?
"Oh, I"
- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
Jumping off another roof?
"Kyle, I've learned my lesson."
And I'm here to learn another one.
"You said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me."
I can't.
There's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
"Oh, Amanda."
She's home?
As a surprise.
You're anxious about it.
"Your heart's beating really fast, I can tell."
"She told me, ""We need to talk. """
So?
You don't think that means anything?
Uh... it means she wants to talk to you?
Isn't that a good thing?
That's what I thought.
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
"You're here about Ben, of course."
What about Ben?
-Ben Haverman.
"This morning, the newspaper said he had died."
"Out of the blue, it said."
That must have been our Ben.
"Bronze Lion, ex assault group member, it has to be him."
"Yes, it's Ben."
Oh God.
Out of the blue.
Was it his heart?
Are you going to the cremation?
"-No, I have to do something else."
You?
"-Well, so many people are dying."
Fantastic garden.
"-Yes, it's my pride and joy."
It takes a lot of time.
They're beautiful I've never seen them before.
Which ones exactly?
-The pink ones.
I've got those from Israel.
The children brought them for me.
Nice holiday present.
-They live there.
Have a seat.
"Yes, they're three very tough rascals."
They participate in every war.
"Syria, Jordan, Egypt, you name it."
They've got that from you.
They're real American Jews.
Very fanatical.
"""And I meant what I said, and I said what I meant."
"""An elephant faithful, 100%."""
Give me five!
"Yes, sirree."
"Hi, baby."
- Your mom smells good enough to eat.
"- What does she smell like, Daddy?"
She smells like pepperoni pizza.
Sausage.
Lots of cheesy cheese.
And a frog.
"Clara, honey... did you tell Mr. Rodriguez that we would eat the cost of his kid""s procedure?"
- Dad?
- Boo Boo!
"Hey, baby, welcome home."
My girl.
"This afternoon, I hired a new receptionist."
"J.T., take the elbows off the table, honey."
"It""s rude."
Thank you.
"- What""s her name, Daddy?"
- Rebecca Singer.
But she goes by Lisa.
She just went through a rough divorce.
"She""s completely broke."
Can you imagine?
Take your fingers out of your mouth and eat more.
"L""ll bet she""s super nice."
She just needs somebody to give her a break.
"- That""s way generous of you, Dad."
- Just try one string bean.
"You know, it felt good."
Not anyone else.
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to a teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
Go have your Robin Williams'
"""O captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.
"Excuse me, sir."
Can you tell me how to find room 305?
Sure.
"Um... head down the hall, take your first right, and it's the..."
third door on the left.
"Thanks, Sam."
"You got tall, Winchester."
Trust me.
This will help.
That ghost is dead.
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!
"Well, you know what I mean."
"It knew my name, Dean."
My real name.
We burned Barry's bones.
What the hell?
"Well, maybe it wasn't Barry."
Maybe we missed something.
We just got to go back.
No way.
How did we not see this before?
- What?
- Check it out.
"Oh, my gosh, you guys."
The yoga instructor just smiled at me.
He has the cutest... dimples.
Shh.
Ok... he's telling us to shut up.
His smile is just his state of zen.
"Oh, God."
Namaste.
Namaste.
Do you guys really do this all the time?
Yeah.
I have to.
I'm older than you.
I get fatter quicker.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got your message.
You're late.
Hey.
Hi.
What's going on?
You guys look so serious.
I was just telling Dale about my wedding
"Um, Drew still hasn't picked a tux yet."
Or groomsmen for that matter.
"Well, you know we're guys."
We take a little bit longer with that stuff.
Yeah.
"Well, I gotta go."
I have a hair appointment at 2:00 and then a couple jewelry design appointments.
"Oh, that's so fetch."
"Congrats, girl."
"Thanks, girl."
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
A camel!
Uh-huh.
Course this isn't really Africa.
It's the French Morocco.
"Well, it's Northern Africa."
Still seems like Las Vegas.
We're just a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert.
I don't know. ln school they call this the Dark Continent.
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.
- Marrakech?
Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. it sure does.
(Chuckles)
"(Horn Honking, Tyres Screeching)"
(Yelling ln Arabic Language)
Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
What's the matter?
(Both Speaking Arabic Language)
"Well, I sure want to thank you."
"Without your help, anything might have happened here."
"My pleasure, monsieur."
There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
Yeah.
Just what was the trouble?
Uh... your little boy accidentally pulled off his wife's veil.
- 0h.
Yeah.
- Hank!
"I want to introduce my wife, Mrs McKenna."
- How do you do?
"- Come in, have a drink."
"- No, thanks."
I'm in a hurry.
You're always in a hurry!
"- Mrs Keka, a letter for you."
- Thank you.
Put it away.
It'll rain in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Mr. American!
Here it is.
From America.
"Good, good."
Do you save those things for me?
Of course I do.
I'll get to you.
"Tesla, turn it off."
What can I tell you?
He gets scared shitless when he hears this.
Pensions are finally safe!
- It really scared me.
"- Go on, have a drink."
"Tesla, I can understand your inventions, your ideas..."
"I support that, but..."
Can you tell me how many pension robberies we had here?
I've got no idea.
Of course you don't.
- Do you want me to tell you?
- Go ahead.
Not one!
Not a single robbery!
Who on earth would attack me here and steal the pensions?
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.
Time enough to waste this jerk first.
- Are you retarded or what?
- He touched Martine.
This rat is jinxed!
Here they come!
"I'm warning you, lying is my speciality."
You're not what's lying.
- What is?
- Poverty!
"If one lies, it's to get... one shouldn't ever get!"
"Here, it's okay."
"Jeez, my clog!"
We can't stay here!
- Do you have money?
- No!
"It's full of memories, this place."
I started when I was thirteen.
I never hurt.
I made supermen out of them.
"Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold."
The ice queen doesn't want to die.
To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love...
Same battle.
What are you?
- Hatchet man?
Pocket knife?
- Pardon?
Friend of a friend?
Where did Mickey unearth you?
Is the cadaver in your way?
We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."
He solves...
"Natalie, who does your hair?"
"Oh, God."
"Well, you take your time."
Okay?
"I'll just be over here at the crime scene, if anybody's interested."
Natalie?
"My mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture with me."
Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!
Or suicide.
Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.
"In many ways, this reminds me of the killer astronaut case"
I solved last year.
You probably read about it.
"Hey, Monk?"
Look at this.
You've gotta be the youngest attorney in the firm to sit on a case this big.
I don't know.
"Listen, here, hey."
"I was gonna give this to you at dinner, but it feels appropriate here."
Danny.
"Oh, my God."
I saw it and I thought of you.
It's beautiful.
"Here, here, here."
- Can we afford this?
I had some stocks pay out dividends.
You know.
Can't a guy do something nice for this girl?
"Yes, he can."
I love you.
"Wait, you didn't get this off that dead girl, did you?"
Wow.
Wow.
- Just checking.
I'm just... pushed too far to his throat.
Did you know...
- I don't know.
Tell me how.
Say it.
"Yeah, I would've."
- How?
"I don't know, okay?"
"No, it was an accident."
I didn't want him dead.
"You must've choked it back into his windpipe, right?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was an accident."
Here.
Take this.
You look half frozen.
Thank you.
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.
I was supposed to fix the gate.
It's...
It's fine.
It's no big deal.
You could have been hurt.
And...
I'm...
I'm sorry.
"Pin, if it wasn't for you, I would have never met Raven."
"You'd have met him, one way or another."
Some things are just meant to be.
Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.
"- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?"
- No.
Pin forgot to mend the gate.
Oh.
Kind of boring.
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves.
Or who Ghost Pony is.
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.
I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?
You want a ripe mango?
Come on!
I'm in the mall!
Yes sis.
"Okay, bye!"
How's Joy?
.
Why are you looking for her?
What do you want to hear?
.
That she's okay?
.
And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
- Bring him in.
- Yes sir!
"I'm so famous, there's bound to be impostors."
I want to see the Commissioner!
Where's he?
Where's he?
He's a mad nutcase!
Does he look like one?
All mad nutcases say someone hit their head!
Someone hit my head!
"The Commissioner, where is he?"
Say something or he'll get mad.
I'm the commissioner.
I'm Hiroshima Tora from Japan.
Ali Baba Toyota wadashiwa Yamaha!
Abracadabra toro sahimi tempura sayonara!
He can't even understand my Japanese.
What?
- O sake teppanyaki yamato desu ka.
- What?
What's the name of Hiroshima Tora's father?
"He doesn't even know his pa's name,"
- he's not Hiroshima!
- l am!
- How dare you pose as Hiroshima?
- You...!
I have the Emperor's appointment letter.
Don't try to fool us with a bit of paper!
Emperor's letter...!
"Come on, take him out!"
Take him out!
I'm Hiroshima Tora!
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
I'm going up.
Are you OK on your own while I get you something to wear?
Will you tell Simon I'm here?
Of course.
Got your plastic tits yet?
No.
But I will get some as soon as I'm 18.
"- Hi, Patricia."
- Sofie's here.
She's crying.
She's crying again?
- Sofie.
"Are you OK, baby?"
- I just feel so low.
- Where have you been?
- Sleeping in the park.
- Why didn't you go down to the boat?
- You can't help me.
- Of course I can.
- What's up?
- My mum.
- She'll calm down again.
She's thrown you out.
Tell the bitch I did the right thing.
- It's dead embarrassing for me.
- What the hell is going on?
"Morning, girls."
Is something wrong?
- What's this?
- Check out the centre spread.
"- No, thank you."
- You've got to see it.
The boxes aren't going anywhere.
But I told Nicole that I-
The best part about spring cleaning is ditching out on spring cleaning.
"You can't do it, can ya?"
You always have to do the right thing.
And you always find a way of putting fun before work.
"Alphabetical order, my encyclopedic friend."
"But I will have you know, I'm done with my room."
And I'm trashing this with the rest of my stuff.
But first...
Bite marks.

It's irresistible.
Come on.
Show me what you got.
Okay.
Keep going.

No one knows.
I'm surprising my mom for her birthday.
You're a good present.
How's New York?
Amazing.
Everything I imagined.
And the music program?
The teachers are all so inspiring.
And the students there are so talented.
Like you.
Yeah.
Chelsea.
Colin.
Colin?
Let's go!
Morning.
Tell Casey I'm sorry.
It sounded like I woke the baby.
He's cutting his first tooth.
Nobody sleeps.
That's a lot of blood.
It's Miranda Clark's.
She's in the hospital.
"Multiple cuts and bruises, concussion, possible skull fracture."
She have profile?
Her boyfriend does.
"Colin Blakely, The New Shadow."
"A year ago, he's bussing tables, now he gets 3 mil a picture."
So it fits the pattern of the other eight.
"Victim's high profile, young Hollywood, no forced entry, no prints."
Hmm.
Where was Mr. Blakely?
Clubbing.
Got home at dawn and found her.
They must have known he was out and got surprised by the girlfriend.
That's a big escalation.
Where's The Shadow now?
Kaiser.
He insisted on riding in the ambulance.
It happened before I got here.
What'd they get?
"3 grand in cash, and take a look."

Another couple of days in Devon.
London for the studio shoot.
Then what?
Back to Careless Talk and carrots?
Don't know.
Swain's talking about another feature.
Air-raid wardens.
There'll be slop.
I don't know.
- Here.
I'll get you a real desk.
Marry you.
- Get out.
Horace:
Get outta here.
"- Fuck, I didn't see that."
Horace:
Get outta here.
Fucking backgammon.
"Oh, shit."
Here come these two rummies.
- Hi.
Pete:
"Hi, Lenny."
- Hi.
"- Pete, you're gonna serve 'em?"
- Why not?
Fucking Ford.
He's a fucking piece of shit is what he is.
And he's a clumsy motherfucker.
"- Pete, I understand you don't like the president, but the fact is, he never said ""Drop dead, New York."""
"He probably said-- he said something a lot more boring, like,"
I'll veto any bill that includes the bailout of the municipal government of New York.
"- He said it, Jimmy!"
- Okay.
- He said it!
"- All right, all right, Jimmy, why don't you change the subject, huh?"
What else is in the news?
"- Well, Namath going to the Rams."
I mean...
- Who cares?
"- Well, I for one, don't like it."
Anyone care to weigh in?
- Joe Namath has a great tush.
I see a light.
- You're not dying.
It's just your ankle.
"Oh, God!"
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me!
- Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
"Throw a rock, honey."
Blunt chest in 2.
"You look wonderful, by the way."
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
"- BP's falling, 70 systolic."
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
"Given there's only one, I don't see how you can."
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.
"He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it."
I need a thoracostomy tray.
"All right, let's see how much air he's got in here."
"Oh, God!"
"That any better, Mr. Chambers?"
Likewise!
"Come on, boy!"
Come on!
Schnapps?
"Well, Sam, here's to your very good health."
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
"You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog."
Yeah?
That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
"- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?"
"- No, no, no, not yet."
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole!
Ha-ha!
How are you?
I got lots trouble.
"Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap."
"What matter, huh?"
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
"Two of my dogs, they die."
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
"Quiet, now!"
Yo!
"That's one fine dog, mister!"
"You want to sell, maybe?"
"- No, I don't."
- I'll say he don't!
"You know, that fellow back there... just offered him 1,000 bucks."
- One thousand bucks?
"- He's like this genius, super secretive."
- Okay.
"And apparently, they're working on this new project."
Big money involved.
Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm?
Fo Shou?
Yeah?
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo of anything that they're working on, that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs."
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi."
Um...
Just Cooper.
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine.
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Follow me.
"- Oh, yeah."
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that."
"Okay, great."
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.
She wouldn't wear anything that wasn't perfect.
It doesn't matter anymore.
[ Sobs ]
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Can I-
"- Can I, uh, drive you home or somethin'?"
"I'm sorry, Mr. Spooner."
I--
I have to get out of here.
[ Sighs ]
No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.
What the hell was that?
Everyone okay?
Dirk!
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
"All right, everybody stay where you are."
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
"I'm like ""21 Jump Street."""
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
Where is it?
No way you'll ever find it.
Where is it?
!
Sam Winchester.
Still a bully.
"You, you jocks."
You popular kids.
you always thought you were better than everybody else.
"And to you, I was just Dirk the jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.

[Sighs] I'll be right there!
Who is it?
[Danny] Miss Elliot?
Yes?
Miss Karla Elliot?
Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?
[Chuckles] I don't know.
He'll be gone in a minute.
There you go.
Thank you.
Do it.
That's good.
Mmm.
Ahh!
[Whispering] I love you.
I have always loved you.
[Ticking]
[Ticking Continues]
Ya haven't got a warrant.
You just want to get me in some kind of trouble.
Go away!
Go away!
- Come on...
- Just go away!
Mr. Jacob!
- Why do you have to go?
- Because I have to.
I have to go home and get some money.
"So we can buy new books, medicine and food."
And help all the others.
Do you promise to come to my birthday?
I swear.
And I'll be calling you every other day.
Okay?
"And that's not going to be a lot of times, because I'll be home in 8 days."
Perhaps you can take me there one day.
Perhaps.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

Why can'tyou justenjoy it?
[Sighs]
I do.
I do in my own way.
"Then whatare you scared of, honey?"
"I'm notscared, Buddy."
You don't understand.
"They're playing for keeps, Buddy."
"You know, the press, the kids, the Liberals out there."
They're outthere trying to figure out howto tearme down.
- They're allyour enemies?
- Yes.
"You, personally?"
Yes!
"Listen, this is aboutme."
Why can'tyou understand that?
"I mean, you of all people."
It's notthe war.
It's Nixon!
"It's not Vietnam, it's Nixon."
Theywantto destroy Nixon.
"If I expose myselfjust the slightest bit, they'll tear my insides out."
You want that?
You know?
"You wantto see that, Buddy?"
It's not pretty!
"Sometimes I think that's whatyou want, Dick."
Whatthe hell are you saying?
Are you drunk?
"Jesus, you sound just like them now."
"I gotta keep fighting, Buddy, forthe country."
"These people running things, the elite!"
You have to visit.
Your house is large.
That would be ackward.
Maybe ill get a new exam in the university.
"Thats a good idea, good birdwatchers are needed in this country."
Thats for sure.
Its gonna be strange without the war
Yes.
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow.
-How long is it since you have seen them?
Soon four years.
A beer?
"-No, i have to...."
"-You, all the others went into town."
"One beer in the cantine, just the two of us."
Is it a date?
If it helps we can call it that.
-It helps.
-Good.
Cheers!
Thanks
You didnt think you'd get away that easy?
Skinnarland sends his regards.
The sheriff is threatening with exposing them all.
-So you will have your hands full.
Straight back.

"Good,Thanks."
-Einar reports about good weather in the area.
-Good.
-Have a good trip.

"No, 9."

- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
Cool.
That I'm on the list.
"Well, I can't say I'm surprised."
You made my top ten.
Just squeaked in there.
"Well, I don't even know if I'm going to do it."
Why wouldn't you?
I have my reasons.
"So don't do it, then."
"So, you don't think I should do it?"
"Alex, are you asking my permission?"
No.
Why would I need to do that?
It's not like we're...
It was one date.
One motorcycle ride.
'Cause I'm really not the possessive type.
Good.
'Cause I'm not really... a possession.
Can I see you tonight?
"Yeah, I'd like that."
"Oh, no, not tonight."
I've got to prepare for a deposition.
Tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow's tough.
- Working at the tavern?
"No, I, uh..."
I've kind of got a date.
Really?
Not a date date.
It's a blind date.
It was set up a week ago.
"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Gentlemen, please go check that shit out."
Freeze!
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but higher-self doesn't.
"Jesus, baby."
She was talking to the man.
Shit.
Look at this.
Dude's got memory lock on.
"Well, that's all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
....
- It's nothing.
- It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"27 vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
"- Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
Are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No.
"Thank you, Miss Givens."
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Givens?"
"Of course, I am."
I'm fine.

"Bawacog, Croutch, Dark_Chii, McFly, MiniBen314, Thirteen."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
Yeah?
"Yeah, I got a good look."
"Yeah, yeah."
I got it.
"Sure, I'll take care of him."
"Out of the way, blubberhead."
The famine is on.
"Guys, want some cigarettes?"
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.
"You better pack them now, boys."
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
- A nickel you don't conk him.
"- All right, a nickel I do."
"- You missed him, chump."
- Yeah.
A nickel apiece you owe.
That cop don't walk right or something.
"- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic."
- You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from in police college.
Look.
"Hello, toots."
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
"Oh, nuts."
Hey!
What are you doing with my baby?
"""Hey!"
"What are you doing with my baby?"" Here's your baby!"
- You loafer!
I'll get the cops after you!
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."
- Wow.
- Instant classic.
- Wow.
- That was really scary.
"- Yeah, yeah."
I was very scared there for a minute.
"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.
Who's Brent Hoffman?
He was my favorite cat.
"You... you had to put him down, huh?"
"Uh, no, no."
He was eaten by two of my other cats.
Really hard to watch.
"Hey, I really appreciate you guys coming to one of my sing-alongs finally."
- Yeah.
- It's fun.
"And as a ""thank you,"""
I've got some extra tickets to the Rihanna concert this weekend.
Do you guys wanna go?
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun.
"Who is that, though?"
"Yeah, I'm excited, though."
"What do you mean, ""who is that""?"
"she's light-skinned, with the butt."
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
- Really?
Wow!
I didn't know that.
All right then.
"Okay, let's celebrate."
"Yeah, because the new number i have in mind is about half a mil."
[Spits]
[ Clears Throat ]
"Come here, Russ."
- I rather not.
"- Russ, come sit down."
"- No, no."
"- Russ, sit the fuck down!"
Okay.
"Unfortunately, Russell, we have a new wrinkle in the situation."
"Oh, really?"
What's the wrinkle?
Basically I had to play pinata with Jerry the bookie's skull.
- That ups the invoice a little.
- Is he okay?
"- No, he's dead."
- Oh!
"Oh, God."
"You know, okay."
I'm really uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.
"You know, not to mention,"
I broke my 1986 World Series commemorative bat.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- It was a gift from my mother.
"She's gettin' a little old, and she's not feeling good these days."
- Hasn't left the house in 6 weeks.
"- Okay, just give me -"
"She wants to work for me, because she needs money."
What for?
She has all she needs here!
"Just sit down, Franz."
You want something to drink?
Coffee?
Quick!
Come in and shut the door!
"No sleep last night, Franz?"
You need money?
I don't need money!
- Put the gun down!
What's going to happen now?
"You'll slaughter your family, or what?"
I don't want to show up in the newspaper like that!
"I said, I don't need money!"
Franz doesn't need money.
Does it work with the suit?
"Yes, the suit looks good."
I look old.
No.
I would say mature.
I'd like to ask you something.
The tie looks good on you.
If you think so.
There is still a problem.
It'll be fine.
Are you coming with me?
I don't think I'd make it through an evening like this.
You don't have to.
I know.
Just tonight.
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
It's too hot in this gown.
We always feel the heat when we're going on a date.
What if we got found out?
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.
"When it comes to girls, you've got to be brave."
"If you have little courage, you must have a thick skin."
- I've got an idea to show off your heroism.
- How?
The painted face you're afraid of will come for you tonight.
- You slapped me!
"- No, I was swatting mosquitoes."
"Don't be scared, don't be scared."
Watch me teach him a lesson!
Block.
- Kick me now.
- How?
- From the bottom.
- OK.
You got the wrong place.
- Not like that.
Harder.
- Harder?
That's too hard!
Get lost!
This young man has great potential.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
Sifu Wong.
I feel safe around you.
Really?
I'm sorry.
Wait.
Hold it.
"Hey, come on."
"We're all concerned with human rights, for God's sakes."
"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?
"It's against your own principle, for God's sake!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hold it!
Hold it!
"If you want to effect any change, you have to do it within the system."
Director:
"Ok, cut."
That's a wrap.
"I think I'll walk home tonight, Mike."
Take that and drop it by my house.
"Good night, tom."
Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.
"Priests, doctors, lawyers-- I've talked to them all."
I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.
[Airplane flies over]
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
I swear I didn't do it.
Who did this?
Brother...
Brother...
Brother...
Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.
Let the attrocities end with me.
You must save our men.
Let me be the last man to die.
Leave no one.
- Father...
- Kill me.
You bastard!
You came looking for your father.
Kill me now.
How dare you kill my man Cuddappah Raja?
Now kill me.
"You said he'll come as your saviour, right?"
I will kill him infront of your eyes.
and put his dead body under Gocha's feet.
"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.
Kill him.
He is my son Velu.
Vetri Velu.
"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.
Where does the guy live?
"Why, you gonna go there?"
I think I should.
Don't.
You'll regret it.
"It's just a suspicion, but..."
You know how the villagers have been dying out recently?
He's got something to do with it.
He's not human.
Give me his address.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.
You've gotta have a general idea.
It's hard to explain in words.
It's deep in the valley somewhere.
How much further is it?
Still a ways ahead.
Shit!
What's the matter?
It's there.
Over there.
I don't see a house.
Look.
Right over there.
"Whoa, isn't that a deer?"
"So, you weren't making this up."
"What did I tell you, dammit?"
What in God's name...
What's happening?
Look.
So she is in town to kill someone.
And this is the site of her hit.
Hey.
Hey.
"I'm--look, I'm sorry."
I...
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm just...
"I got a lot of stuff to do, you know?"
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Catch up with you later?
"Yeah, absolutely."
Okay.
Bye.
Are we way off base here?
Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.
I'm sure you have.
I want 'em at least another 15 feet back from the stage.
"Officer, hi."
What's going on here?
Setting up for tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Big human rights celebration.
Joseph Dellaman's giving a speech.
The ex-political prisoner?
The rally's here.
He's giving his speech in the square.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
You're a...
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
"You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity."
Farewell.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, good riddance, ya loony!"
"""Rendezvous with Star Command."""
"-Hey, gas dude!"
-You talkin' to me?
"-Yeah, man."
Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet?
Andy!
Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
"Oh, no!"
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
-Buzz!
"Buzz, come back!"
-Go away!
No!
"Buzz, you gotta come back!"
I...
I found a spaceship!
"It's a spaceship, Buzz!"
"Come on, man, hurry up!"
"Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!"
"-Cutting Boulevard, huh?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
Which way?
"Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?"
"And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home."
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
"- No, I want to help you."
"Mr MacGregor, if I mentioned the name Dennis, and that I know that you're being ""B""-ed..."
"- ""B""-ed?"
"- Well, blackmailed."
"- Look, may I come in?"
- Wee Sonny MacGregor blackmailed?
- I think you're mistaken.
- You're wondering why I'm here.
"I know why you're here, friend."
"You're being ""B""-ed, too."
"- No, I'm a complete outsider."
- I wouldn't say that.
"Please, let me explain."
A young lady came to see me...
You're a lucky fellow.
"Good luck to you, sir, and good day."
- Mr MacGregor?
- Go away.
You'll regret this.
- How did he find out?
- I don't know.
Why didn't you let him talk?
He obviously wanted an ally.
The more friends we have now...
Make an ally of that idiot?
"No, thank you."
I'll rely on my bomb.
And now... for the gunpowder.
(Doorbell)
Bill!
"Oh, Bill!"
Honey!
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.
Did you say that to him?
Something like that.
Strong words.
Something like that.
Strong words.
Did you mean it?

'Course I didn't.

Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
MARSHALL:
"Old man Marshall, as long as you're still married to Lily, you're doing just fine."
"Sir, this is on us."
Sorry the wings were so hot.
"Oh, no, dear."
It wasn't that they were too hot.
It's just that I had wings earlier.
Much earlier.

And it was on early.
How early?
Mike?
"wakey, wakey."
"But then, everything changed."
Hey.
Hey.
See my show?
"Oh, I meant to watch it."
"I just got so busy with the whole ""being sound asleep"" thing."
"It took all night, eight hours down the drain."
"Oh, it's fine."
But get this:
After the broadcast...
Hi.

Excellent.
"Et vous aussi, monsieur?"
"Nothing for me, thanks."
Tres bien.
Merci.
Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
She could be fucking him right now.
She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.

Nice to meet you all.

This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."

I didn't get it.

Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.

"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER

Just go away.
They're gone now.
Don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.
Jenny!
How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
"No, that's fine."
"Joongrae, I like you."
You live foolishly.
You know me?
"Just, a little."
"You're reckless, but not loathsome."
You know nothing about me.
I knew I'd meet you some day.
Seriously?
Do you love me?
I like you very much.
- Do you want me that much?
"- Yes, more than any other woman."
"Then, have me."
I don't mind.
But I still love you.
"Joongrae, you are mine today."
"Thank you, Moonsook."
I love you.
"I love you, too."
Have a seat.
You must've gotten up early.
Aren't you tired?
"No, are you?"
"No, but I think I'm coming down with something."
It's because we worked ourselves too hard last night.
"Oh, come on."
"You were married once, right?"
"Yeah, I got divorced."
A long time ago.
Should I leave you alone?
Seems like you were deep in thought.
- Hanna?
- Her daughter.
Are you her son?
No.
I'm just the guy who opens the door.
"Mr. Leland, this is my daughter Hanna."
- Hello.
"- Hello, Hanna."
"Oh, I forgot to get your signature on this."
Um...
It's just part of authorizing you to look at the safe deposit box.
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
Um...
- I won't be late.
- Okay.
What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.

Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."

Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?

"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.

Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."

"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.

And... and did you?
Did you dig it up?
Oh.
Moved before I could.
What a shame.

"Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time."
"That's wonderful, yeah."
"There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation."
Where are you going this late?
To the West.
"- What, on foot in the Zone?"
- Can I see your papers?
"Well, did you have a nice New Year's?"
Your name?
"Well, what's your name, Miss?"
Karka!
Pauline Karka.
But it is... bloody.
What do you have there?
My child.
May I see it?
"Now come inside and get warm, young lady."
The Rats
- Based on the play by:
Adapted for the screen by:
- What's it about?
- Go to the police!
"Room 12, the police inspector said."
"For that you drag my child out in the freezing cold, risking it dying?"
"- Well, whatever, Mrs John."
- Don't shout at my daughter like that!
"What has happened, Miss Pauline?"
"The inspector didn't say, Mr Hassenreuter,"
- only that they are to id..idi..
Pauline...
- Identify...
"- ...her, yes."
- Pauline?
I've never heard that name.
- What am I to do there?
You like doing that.
"Yours, Corporal Dawes."
"You, Evans."
Gordon.
"Come on, Stubbins."
Each man check his release box.
Easy now.
Nothing worse than blokes hitting their boxes at the same time.
It sounds like the Salvation Army on a Sunday afternoon.
"You've nothing to worry about, they're smashing parachutes."
They ought to be at £60 a piece.
"Morning, Bill."
Morning.
"All right, you gentleman aloft."
We're ready.
We are ready.
He's ready.
So are we.
"Gentleman, I don't like your colour."
You look a little green.
What colour would you like?
Suppose you surprise me.
"0K, Number 0ne, a good parachuting position."
Action station Number One.
Jump when I touch you on the shoulder.
Are you ready?
Go!
There goes my first one.
Reach up high on your front left webs.
Pull down steadily now.
"Your head well forward, feet together."
"OK, hold it."
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
One of which is pain.
"The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him."
Chase!
How's cameron?
She's not giddy.
Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
- I don't know.
- Grunge band out of Kentucky.
Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.
Thanks.
- My God.
- What?
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.
- You must have that one.
- No.
For my mom.
This was her favorite group when she was my age.
It's signed by Belinda.
This would be the perfect graduation present.
"I've been looking all week long, and I couldn't find anything."
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?
From college.
From business classes.
I'm surprised she has time for anything... except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture.
"It's not a lot of time, but..."
- Go on.
Get it.
She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.
- This was fate.
- I think it was.
"And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
I'm a lucky man.
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep.
Thank you.
- Is everything there?
- Yes.
- I didn't touch anything.
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"- Yes, but I'm going home."
"- Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
- Do you like dancing?
- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
- Silent cinema?
- Yes.
- What do you do when you go out?
- I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
Thanks for the wallet.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
Temperature suddenly dropping with no explanation.
Thought that you were a man of science.
I am.
But I also know that there are things in life that even science can't explain.
Okay.
Carter.
Any messages for me?
"Uh, no, Ms. Marquez, no messages."
There's nothing from Mr. Harpel?
Nothing.
Danny here?
Do you see him?
What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.
[Sighs]
One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.
Uh...
Lobster truck is here.
Hm.
"An hour ago, I found Mr. Myers down in the E.R. washing the feet of a homeless guy."
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Reminds me of my Uncle Ben...
"Goes to mass every day, twice on Sundays."
Nobody calls him crazy or that he has some syndrome.
You believe in God?
I was raised Catholic.
It never leaves you.
I pray sometimes... mostly for the mets.
God's record there is pretty spotty.
- What's going on?
- Anything?
Who brought Mr. Janson out here?
- I can see!
- You can see?
Jacob brought him for lobster.
Ha!
"Jacob, I can see!"
I can see!
All praise to Hashem!
I can see!
It's a miracle!
"I touched Larry, and Larry can see."
This is a fact.
"Look, as scientists, you have to accept hard evidence."
Larry has graves' disease.
That's why he was blind.
We treated him with a steroid that reduced the swelling...
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Shut up.
- He totally knows.
"- My point is it took Elliott a year to say he loved me, and another year to say it without using a cartoon voice."
"I think I should be ready for a guy who shows emotions,right?"
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Don't you think?
Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
Dad.
Um...
"You know,I found a strand of your hair on my jacket."
"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.
"I love that you work here,and that your hair smells."
Thank you.
"Oh,can we go for a walk or something?"
Yeah.
Is that...?
Get a cramp?
You okay?
Yeah!
We should come back to the beach tonight.
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
Look out.
Watch it.
"Watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I... don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
Watch out.
Short circuit the control system.
"Oh, no."
Letha!
Letha!
Look out.
Get out of my way.
Can't you put that thing out?
"Come on, take a shot."
Move it.
"Now, Tony,"
Make a hole in the plastic shield.
And it doesn't have to be neat.
Have some coffee.
It'll wake you up.
can we have the check?
What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
do you?
That's very annoying.
but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
To have my picture in the papers...
Be the first in Rome...
"Damn it, Malaparte, take me to Capri."
You're laughing at me!
"I can't believe it, you're laughing at me!"
"No, no, I'm laughing at myself."
It's incredible.
"The destruction, hunger, violence..."
All that for a photo in the papers.
You ignorant son of a bitch!
"I hate your attitude, you latin snob!"
Know-it-all!
All of you!
Back!
Pervert!
Pig!
Dirty gigolos!
"Imbecile, imbecile!"
And you're laughing at me?
"You can stick your flag right between your legs, in your ass!"
One catastrophe after another.
"Get out, get out!"
It's unbelievable!
What a disgrace.
"Listen, if you take me to the airport, I'll pay."
Stop!
Stop!
I'll give you US$50 to take me to the airport.
Get in.
What's happening?
What's this?
The Vesuvius.
You won't?
You really won't do as I say?
Director Kim.
Director Kim!
Director Kim!
"Director Kim, get back here, right now!"
"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
"-Good, if you want..."
"I am going to prove it to me, but you do not take advantage which my parents have gone away to Florence."
And that does not return until this the night.
And you do not watch to me by the eye of the lock.
Absolutely.
In agreement.
"It sees calm, I am ""gentleman""."
-Certainly you do not watch to me?
-I have said that no. to You.
-I will do in a while.
I go.
-Please.
You do not watch?
eh?
"No, absolutely."
"I want that the things between us they are pretty, very clean, until the marriage."
"Soon all good will go, will be all normal one."
You do not watch?
eh?
holy shit...
Alvaro?
what you do in the ground?
Eh?
I do... yoga.
You like?
Good... it is not bad...
"It is pretty, truth?"
yes.
You like it or not?
Good... enough...
They see here.
"No, Alvaro, you do not do it."
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.
The law is right.
Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?
Law is dead.
But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.
"Come on, look."
"I'll give you $10,000, you can do as you want."
"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?
(Laughing)
"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.
"You were an accountant, that right?"
"Me, accountant?"
"Can't make a good living these days, don't you agree?"
One thing.
"Was your name Lun Taichen, and did you know Cheng Tachwan?"
Cheng Tachwan?
Cheng Tachwan?
"Don't mind me, Joyce."
I've worked the Samaritans' Christmas bazaar.
I know misery loves company.
I just feel so alone.
"Listen, I was actually on my way to a coffee morning."
A really nice crowd.
Why don't you come along?
Thank you.
"well, well, if it isn't Miss marple herself."
I thought I couId smell cat piss.
Looks like we're going to have to up the ante.
"- DeIphiniums are looking good, Margaret."
"- Thanks, Barb."
"This way, Joyce."
Come along.
Quiet as you can.
Baby asleep upstairs.
"- Joyce, hi."
- Pam.
"- Oh, my God."
What happened?
"- Oh, yoga."
You left so quickly the other day.
Is everything...
OK?
"Erm, fine."
you could fit a whole salmon into this one.
I Iove the coIour-coordinated Iids.
"I think we've got just the thing for you in here, Joyce."
Beretta nine-miIIimetre.
"Good, solid pistol."
Squeeze off a full clip and you can stop a Fiat Panda at 50 yards.
What the hell are you thinking?
"It's war, Jomar."
We can get rid of the heavy water once and for all.
- We don't have a choice!
- I don't believe that.
What do we really know about the Germans?
Do we know how far they have come?
I will try to find out.
Do that!
"- Lise, are you looking forward to the concert?"
- Yes.
To hear Beethoven?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Concert on Saturday.
- Thank you!
There's a concert on Saturday.
Here you go.
Good afternoon.
Ellen Henriksen.
I'm arranging the concert.
- Arvid Fladmoe.
- Kristoffer Kleive.
I hope you had a nice trip.
"8 kg in the hull, close to the engines."
Approximately 45 minutes after departure.
Friday is the worst day.
The ferry is always completely full on that day.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not the one making the decisions.
Excuse me...
"Yes, what is it?"
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark.
Be gone.
- Wait!
- Come back here!
"Sir Knight, come back, please!"
Griselda.
Mr. Fishfinger.
I've got to go.
Sorry about your hand.
It hurts!
I've missed you.
I've kept your potato.
Bye!
You really are a big disappointment to me.
I thought you were gonna make something of yourself.
He is the king's champion!
- Both:
As fuck!
Look at Tommy.
This is what I'm saying.
"""Practicing with my boys, Edelman, Gronk, and Amendola."""
- God.
- And when was that?
Yesterday.
What?
Get the fuck out of here.
- ( doorbell dings )
"- Oh, shit, I'll get that."
These motherfuckers practicing without me.
"( sighs ) Come on, Ricky, they in Boston, man."
"Well, shit, Edelman lives in LA and Gronk lives here in Miami."
"Last time I checked, Amendola was in Botswana."
"Yet, they get the call and I get the proverbial stiff arm?"
"- Yeah, yeah, you're right."
- That's bullshit.
"You're right, you're right."
Fuck Brady.
Fuck him.
I'ma unfollow his ass any motherfucking way.
You know what?
I'ma set up a practice of my own.
Just fucking go to...
"Hey, T!"
- Yeah?
- Grab me a group together.
"And not that busted-ass quarterback from last time, all right?"
"Who, JaMarcus?"
He used to play for the Raiders.
You're my partners.
You're holding so many options on land you could buy Brooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
- What's that?
- My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I going to do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
- Take care.
- All right.
That's for the dead cop.
Reverend Chapman will introduce me?
With one sentence.
And then what?
Get out of here.
- And which way is that?
- Side door.
No.
He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.
Hey!
Drop it!
Help me!
"- Let her go, Jordan."
- Stand back!
You got no where to go.
Drop the scissors.
"Listen, fellas, I'm a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders, oh, it's just so unsatisfying!"
That's why they always go out in style.
"Just relax, Jordan."
Don't do anything stupid.
Stupid?
Me?
How can you say that when we've outsmarted you for years?
"Who's ""we""?"
Who's your partner in L.A.?
A genius.
He believed in me.
"Took my visions, made them real."
"Give us a name, Jordan."
You'll never find him.
Ah!
[Gunshots fire]
[Sobbing]
Okay.
"No, I understand."
Thank you.
Hey. [Door closes]
That was Ryan and Esposito.
They had to kill Jordan Keegan.
But they sent us digital copies of Jordan's computer.
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
Wait!
Hold it!
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.
I'm not that good at it.
"Now, wait a minute!"
Thomas!
Thomas!
Break it to her gently.
Break it to her gently.
He did it to me again.
"Hi, Lena."
Saul's got this little problem.
His heart attacked him.
"No, that's terrible."
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Could you tell me the status of a Saul Greenberg?
An ambulance brought him in a while ago.
Possible heart attack.
Sure.
I'll check for you.
No ambulances have checked in since this morning and that was a pregnancy.
That's impossible.
The ambulance left about five minutes before I did.
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?
Yeah. international Life Support.
- And his doctor?
Who's gonna pay for the window?
Go check out what's going on.
- Why don't you go?
- And you call yourself a man!
"Bello, come here!"
Come here!
"Bello, come here!"
What is going on here?
You're crazy!
Are you allright?
They picked the wrong person for a fight.
"Let's go Franz, here is your hat."
Are you alright?
"What's going on here, constable?"
"Oh, you don't know either?"
Acting like a deaf-mute.
- What do you want?
Franz again?
- Franz will be back.
- Flowers?
"- Yes, please."
I can't possibly accept this.
How do you think how is this gonna work out?
- You'll see.
- Are you hooking up with him?
- You'll see.
Even if you break his bones he'll stay the same.
You're quite smart.
"Reinhold, there are so many men."
I'll get you ten other guys!
I need him!
He must cooperate!
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
Where are you going?
I don't know yet.
Can I come?
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.
"Well, we got to do what's in the photo."
"Right, bro?"
Where we going?
Nowhere.
I don't want to abandon Jasper in case something goes wrong.
Are we okay?
I got jealous.
This is a- it's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.
"And I, obviously, am- I'm not handling it well."
(SIGHS)
You got jealous?
(EXHALES)
Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.
I didn't know cats could smile.
(sighing ) Neither did I.
And there's a blue caterpillar.
Blue caterpillar.
Hmm.
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
off your head.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
(laughing )
Alice.NNothing can harm you there.
Nyou can always wake up.
Like this.
(laughing ) Ow!
(sighing )
Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""Nwas wearing a codfish on your head?"
-Would you wear it?
N-Alice.
a corset is like a codfish.
not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.Nl didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
Never since I can remember.
I want her to be able to learn
- how to solve problems on her own.
- Yeah.
"I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever."
Thanks or whatever.
He dumped me.
- What?
- What?
W-What'd he do that for?
He said I was suffocating him.
I can't believe you guys made me talk to my boyfriend.
You ruined my life!
And mine!
SAMANTHA:
God!
- JEN:
Um...
- JENNA:
Let's get piercings.
Do you understand anything that just happened?
Yeah.
Teenagers are crazy.
"I mean, I think we got it wrong."
"Like, babies are not the hard part."
That is the hard part.
But we'll get through it.
- Yeah. (sighs)
- Mm-hmm.
We just gotta put our thinking caps on.
"Okay, just get the hat, Greg."
"Oh, yeah."
They still got it!
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
- We don't know yet.
"I'm so sorry, Nick."
You think you can figure out what this is?
I'm going to do my best.
"First, I have to test the cat's claws, but if I can't get it from the cat,"
I'm going to have to go see Juliette.
"Okay, are you good here for now?"
- Not really.
- Yes.
"Hey, where you going?"
I'm going to find Adalind.
[Cat yowling]
[Cage rattles]
[Cat yowls]
Maybe it just doesn't like me.
Blutbaden and house pets don't really mix.
"Except, you know, as the occasional between-meal treat."
I'm going to start with some valeriana officinalis.
[Cat hisses]
[Cat screeches] All right.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps approach]
"No, no, no."
Don't shoot.
"Hey, come on."
Put it down.
Who were you shooting at?
Adalind!
Adalind!
[Cell phone ringing]
Yeah?
"He was here at my house, Nick."
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.
We've got to track Zana.
-Sensato.
We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.
VG
-Tangen is out there.
-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?

We will take you in for questioning and searching his apartment.

Sausage?
A little dessert?
"Mom, some dessert forthe Director."
- I'm really fine as is.
- Taste it.
"It's good, a kind of chocolate."
"Kind of, it's called blood pudding."
It's chocolate with pig's blood.
- You have to eat it.
- I got that.
"Yourmother's right, it's not so hot here."
"They told me it was very hot here, but..."
"camels used to bring the mail, the directorwas a Bedouin."
- Are you making fun of me?
- No...
- Mattia!
- How's it goin'?
This guy?
Looks like the michelin man.
He's joking.
"He's the new director, from milan."
- I get it.
- What?
He always gets things late.
- Buy you a coffee?
"- No, I have to work."
"Wait, Iet me introduce two stalwart co-workers."
"little CostabiIe, one of our greatest employees."
- welcome to the famous CasteIIabate.
- Wait!
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?
"Fine, I'll get it... again."
- What do you want me to do first?
- Find the O-neg.
Everything okay in there?
For the time being.
Call for four units of type specific.
Soon as I get this up.
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.
He needs the works.
Those are his kids out there.
"Hey, Frank, can you bring those guys to the Family Room?"
Sure.
"Come on, kids."
This way.
- I'll be right in.
- Great.
- Guide wire?
- I'm getting an error signal.
There's not enough water in the warmer.
- Thanks.
- Cordis inducer.
Stitch.
Where's Dori with the T-pod?
T-pods are on the bottom shelf.
Update his vitals?
"- Okay, infuser's on."
- Looks good.
"Doctor Gilbert Venin, I presume?"
"Shit Livingstone, asshole?"
Your finger's on the pulse.
Mickey the Arab wants a word with you.
I'm very expensive.
"- Playing for keeps, or you got the creeps?"
- Don't you worry.
We're in a pest controlled area.
What's on Mickey's agenda?
Disneyland!
- That's gonna be tough.
"- No, a straight split."
"Tomorrow, midnight, where you want, ladies as witnesses, face to face, all holds barred."
It's high time.
"You shit flies, keep buzzing around Mickey."
"If he ever comes out of the Casbah, he'll regret his mad wanking."
"He's not mad, he's here!"
Skedaddle!
Oh my!
Oh my!
Your what?
Do you have an aspirin?
Your lovely brothers.
"Simon and Edgar, for instance."
out of your league.
Forget it.
Edgar. 5 am.
Blow deal.
Rue Lenine.
In Charenteuil.
That's our turf.
Sure you've got no aspirin?
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."
What do you want?
-To where you go?
They see here.
We speak.
It vetoes the devil.
You have what you deserve.
She can't be.
She never goes out.
KNOCKING
Hiya!
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
"It's Melissa, isn't it?"
Yeah.
I'm Peggy.
This is Elaine.
I know.
OK if we come in for a sec?
"Yeah, sure."
You have the most incredible skin!
Have people told you that before?
Not really.
So pretty it glows.
Let's open that other bottle.
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
The drawer nearest the fridge.
"(If you don't want to do it, just say no.)"
CORK POPS
"Did I mention, this woman is a genius with a lens?"
PEGGY CHUCKLES
"She will make you look better than you have ever looked,"
I guarantee it.
"And if she can't, hell, everything we do is airbrushed, anyway."
I don't think...
I don't really...
We have a deadline.
And there's literally no-one else we can ask.
As a neighbour?
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
- It's at Jay-Mo's Diner.
- [Siren wailing]
[Coughing]
[Siren continues wailing]
[Grunting]
[Tires screeching]
[Coughing]
[Tires screeching]
- Backup's on the way.
- There isn't time.
"All units, 565 East Jefferson."
"I repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
This is Lieutenant Al Garner requesting available fire and EMS units.
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.
"- Repeat, all units, 565 East Jefferson."
- [Coughing]
[Man] BP's 84 over 36.
[Garner] The owner's car was stolen.
I need to ask him some questions.
- He's in and out of consciousness.
- [Labored breathing]
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up for yes and a thumbs-down for no?
Did Kaman Scott do this to you?
We have 15 minutes to get him to the hospital.
Do you know this girl?
Tracy.
Tracy.
Don't let him...
- Please stop him.
- Is Tracy nearby?
My Barefoot Cinderella.
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
And then you'll say do you wanna take a chance.
And stay with me forever.
No one'll ever be more beautiful.
"My barefoot, barefoot Cinderella."
[Audience cheering]
[Music stops]
You rocked.
Not hard when I'm with you.
"Hey, hey, hey."
I'm Hannah.
Hannah Montana ladies and gentlemen.
And apparently her new boyfriend.
Why is it always the guitar player?
Why not a nice cameraman like my nephew Lenny?
"But seriously, I'm happy for you Hannah."
And what's your name?
"Ah, you don't wanna know my name."
Come on.
You kissed her on national TV.
What are you shy all of a sudden?
Come on what's your name?
-Jesse.
-Jesse!
There you have it.
Hannah and Jesse America's new sweethearts.
Good night everybody.
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.

"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
Split!
Where to?
Come here!
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!
"Bravo, aunt!"
That was wonderful!
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?
"Always remember her, before you touch another woman."
You can even remember me.
"Sure, Mom!"
"Call me ""aunt""...not Mom!"
"You were great, young lady!"
"Thank you, Laxmi."
What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""
- And a final consonant.
- And a consonant.
Thank you.
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."
I heard Cary is back with you guys.
"- Yeah, starts today."
- Oh.
He's a good guy.
Wish him luck.
"So, we'll need you out here until we get an office cleared out,"
- if you're all right with that.
- I am.
Good.
It'll just be a few weeks.
"Welcome back, Cary."
Whew.
AN:
Yeah?
"Um, is this FE Construction?"
Hello?
Who is this?
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.

"I'm sorry, kid, I, uh,"
"I don't know, man."
6 months on the sidelines.
I guess I still have a few blisters where I used to have calluses.
I don't think that's what this is.
"Oh, no?"
Then what is it?
You're about to be a dad.
You know?
You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.
Like asphalt is hard.
Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.
"If there's one thing I'm sure of, is that you and Savannah are going to be great parents."
"Charge by the hour, Doc?"
Aah!

Aah!
No...
"Oh, my God."
Eleven.
Aah!
So what do we know?
"Our father's dead, daughter's missing, but we may have caught a break here."
I don't know if we have to retire so soon.
That's been the plan this whole time.
"One last job, travel for a year, settle down and..."
Find normal lives.
We're so good at this.
Do we have to stick to that plan?
Always stick to the plan.
Are you sure this time though?
Like really sure.
I'm always sure.
I could not be more sure about this.
I'm a hundred million billion percent sure.
"Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure."
"We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house."
So cool.
It's not cool.
It used to be cool.
Okay.
This is our last job.
As planned.
Are you sure?
"I am... 100,000 billion percent sure."
Shut up.
"Yeah, sure."
Thank you.
There she is.
Faster than schedule.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Finish it.
Finish what?
The joke.
"Yes, sir, that is correct, sir."
- We are on full lockdown.
- Hey!
We need help up here now!

Heading for Castle Sky.
You've reached the voice mail of Emily Cale.
Why aren't you texting me?
"Em, as soon as you get this, call me back."
"- Keep moving, keep moving!"
"- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol."
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?
I have Eagle.
"Call WFO, get as many men as you can to the Capitol."
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.
A hard perimeter around Castle.
Eastside Gate.
"Come on, let's go, people."
"Fred, open the gate."
Kelly?
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
Used to babysit me.
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.
- Why can't we go into town?
Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
(SPUTTERING)
We have company.
"Have a look, Bayard."
BAYARD:
Bielle.
(BARKING)
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I.
"But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece."
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
"I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size."
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
-Hatter.
-Size.
Fez.
I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
-Cheshire.
"-How's the arm, love?"
All healed.
"Goodbye, sweet hat."
Gossip girl might be right about me
But she's--she's wrong about you.
Without serena van der woodsen
Who would i have dreamt about?
I might have spent my whole life on the outside
If you hadn't let me in...
Which i'm holding against you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
Wait. they're a team.
Team of what?
Wait.
Why are you all here?
I got a text saying to meet you.
- Yeah
- So did I.
- So did I.
You wanted to meet gossip girl.
Well look around.
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high school friendships fade
It's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.
now that all my secrets are out
You have a clean slate...
Until college.
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you. oh.
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.

Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."

I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.

"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!

Tell me it's gonna work!

"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"

Knock-out drops.
Surely you've heard of them?
- For knocking out what?
- People.
Who else?
- You mean a sleeping draught.
"- I suppose so, but instantaneous."
"My dear madam, you're asking for a Mickey Finn."
- Am I?
"- We have a mild soporific here, if you're sleeping badly."
"I'm sleeping perfectly well, thank you."
Mickey Finn...
Mickey...
Thank you very much.
"Desiree, you are the expert on crime, how would one obtain a Mickey Finn?"
"Well, I get all dope on drugs from a little crook called Maury Fish."
He hangs around in a pub called the Limehouse Arms.
The Limehouse Arms?
Thank you very much.
(Piano music and chatter)
- Yes?
- Gin and...
"Port and lemon, please."
- Thank you.
- One and six.
- You know Maury Fish?
- Why?
I want some Mickey Finns.
"The real McCoy, mac."
- What for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
It isn't that I...
Thank you.
Lin?
You're a brave woman.
"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.

"Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right."

M. P:
"Last pad over, next to the water."
- See that runway over by the beach?
- Yeah?
That's where your Peter-san's going to be coming in.
You take care of yourself.
Thank you.
"- Mister, you Beckworth?"
- That's right.
"If you want to go where the war is, this is the way."
"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
"But Ms. Viola, there many dangers along the way."
"Hazard-no, challenges."
-As soon as it comes.
"Okay, find Uncle Ramon ..."
"Send him to bring friends, Adélie how he can."
-Is ...
Do not forget the family motto.
The RE-MASH.
"Come on, Uncle Bud, we have too many fish to catch."
"-So, what news?"
-Ruins.
"Every corner, every direction, completely blocked."
There are rumors of people thinking the unthinkable.
"Noah, are calling The Iceberg's End."
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.
-We can not ...
Return- to seek hundred times.
-There is no escape.
"-Thousands of times if necessary, there is always a way out."
"It does have, and right there."
"Ice, no ice, but it has ice tone and testing ..."

"Ready, you can go."
"Erik, no!"

"You saw, you saw?"
"Never, do it again."
"Father, I flew!"
-Erik.
-I flew!
"I beat my wings, was very quick."
"Yeah, here, want this?"
That should clear up the infection in about 24 hours.
"However, the world might look a little fuzzy to you for a while."
"Here, put these on, Paula."
It'll cut down the glare.

"- Well, to make lunch."
"Lunch has already been prepared, courtesy of Jack, our new short-order cook."
"Well then, I better check on it."
I wonder how many ways you can boil eggs.

"Boy, what a waste of talent."
Hmm.

- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!

I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."

"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
Michelle's pregnant.

I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
Wow!
Add one goldfish.
"Oh, no!"
"For him, time has stopped."
Is it dead?
No.
Watch carefully.
"Now, he's in the future."
He leapt through the time he was frozen.
"No, that's not right."
"On TV, time machines go zoom..."
"Yeah, up and back between past and present."
Correct.
And that's what I'm studying.
"Follow me, please."
I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?
What if he kidnaps us?
You've got your cell phone.
No service.
Isn't he a weirdo?
That's only what my Dad said.
"Come on, come on, come on."

You don't know that for sure.
The King has hated me for five years.
I know things have been difficult between you but...
Our marriage has been for public show.
"In private, he's ignored or slighted me at every turn."
You need to stay strong.
You're still the Queen of France.
Perhaps not for long.
Do you think that the King would want a scandal that could endanger the throne?
"The Dauphin is his son, the King could never admit to anything else."
I had hoped that everything with Aramis was over.

That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
Slapped you!
"You probably think I'm finished, huh?"
!
"No, there's another one!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!"
There's a slap for you!
"Slap, slap, slap!"
"Yeah, there you go!"
"Here's a little ""reach around the back of the head"" slap!"
"Oh, God, please!"
"You have to get away, he won't ever stop!"
"Oh, I'm going slap happy!"
"# I'm goin' slap, slap happy #"
# Slappity slappin' you #
# Teachin' you a lesson for comin' in my house #
"What are you looking at, Robertson?"
!
They're here!
The audition results for the school musical are in!
"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy!"
- All right!
"- All right, Wendy!"
Who's the male lead?
"No surprise there, it's Bridon!"
"- All right, Bridon!"
"- Cool, Bridon!"
I get to be a stand-in!
"Congratulations, Bridon!"
Guess we'll be working a lot together!
"Yeah, great."
Goddamn it!
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
Maybe if he wasn't so handsome...
Which one?
Both.
How can I compete with that?
You had a world-famous TV star and a hunk that drives a truck.
He drives a truck.
"Well, morning's no slouch."
Ah.
She's probably twice as old as both your guys.
"Even so, that body, those big tits..."
"Oh, you did very well, my friend."
I suppose.
You did.
And now it's time to put all that behind us.
We agreed... fresh start.
Fresh start.
Right?
Clean slate.
Clean slate.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Your dirty slate.
Yo.
"Matt, I just got off the phone with Diane's lawyer."
"Oh, fuck."
He told me about the D.U.I.
The D.U.I. with the kids in the car.
"Got to say, didn't see that coming."
It's bullshit.
I was so not drunk.
Believe me...
I've driven drunk.
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
GIGGLING
GIRL GIGGLES
"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
What do you mean?
Have you heard of the killer Chou Lien-chan?
Chou Lien-chan
"No, and I have no quarrel with him"
He's chief disciple of Tiger Yeh
"You killed Tiger Yeh, and he'll come for you!"
It's been 30 years-why bring that up?
Show me your stuff before you die
"En garde, Knight Fan"
You're playing this for real!
I wouldn't joke about it!
My wine
Stay away from my good wine
This 18 falls of the Drunken Immortals!
"I admit defeat, Knight Fan"
Great work!
Can we have a drink now?
Knight Fan
Knight Fan
Knight Fan
Knight Fan
"Here's a letter for you, Knight Fan!"
Nightsweet Premium Wine
Big Cup Fan?
Beggar Su?
Nightsweet Premium!
"Let's go steal some ""crystal"" grapes"
How long has this wine been fermented?
"Thirty years, at least"
Master Chang
"What is it, Ah-fang?"
The boss is waiting for you in the vineyard
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
[Click]
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
[Crying]
"It's when you give, you know, her being allowed to sleep with one person and that's it, no questions asked."
Another plausibly fruitful option.

"I see, you forced to come."
"Yawang, I really miss you!"
Are you allright in the university?
"Sometimes, I think..."

I don't really like movie.
You don't?
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?
Fine.
Fine.
We're out of bullets again tho.
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?
They seem to have plenty.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
These guys got everything Daze!
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?
It's like Christmas!
I got you...
Sucker!
Take your pick mister.
Why don't you decide?
"Okay, let's see..."
"I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze."
"Alright, are you ready mister?"
Sure.
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.
Hardy har har.

Are you done yet?
Come again?
"I said ""Are you done yet?"""
What are you talking about?
"You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you?"
I most certainly was.
With that piece?
"No, stop!"
Look out for the cow!
"Come on, no, not there!"
please stop.
"No, stop!"
We can't go there yet.
people just aren't ready for you.
That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
"Uh, we knowwhat risks you've taken in inviting us here."
[Translator] I took no risk.

"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?

"You'll love it,"
Fuck!
I'm fucking you.
Fucking you...
"Sorry, you're eating."
Oh It's my pleasure.
How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?
Hey you?
What's with these glass arrows in the head?

"Gimlet here, over!"
"Male, reply!"

Can't contact Yankee.
I'll send a scout team to the surface to investigate.
To the surface?
Hey!

Didn't earn your points yet?
Incidentally you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night.
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"I know, I realize, but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"When she's better, I'll ask her."
It couldn't hurt.
In the meantime....
That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
Where's a pencil?
Right here.
She'd love it!
What's her name?
I lied.
It's for me.
The spelling is on the back:
Kinderman.
"You know that film you made, Angel?"
I saw that six times!
Really?
It was beautiful.
Thank you.

You bitch!
Do it!
"Please, no!"
Let Jesus fuck you!
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
Let's not stay here.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
Inspector Arivazhagan.
Can I come in?
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my doing.
Do you know how many years of jail for a hit-and-run case?
"Keep quiet, Ashwini."
Sir...
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
"I'll miss you, Manoj."
Be careful.
I'll be awaiting your call.
Call me soon.

We're driving past the oldest buildings.
We're now going to sex theatre Casa Rosso.
We wish you a very good time.
Can we help?
"-That's nice of you, thank you."
I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?

I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.

I'll give you some medication.
I'm growing a mustache.
Miss Brody.
It's me.
It's Detective Ridgely.
"You all right, honey?"
Take this.
Miss Brody.
Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again.
You understand?
It's all right.
"Hey, Barry."
"Long night, squire?"
Hospital bills.
You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois?
If you'll just be patient...
Thank you.
But this says 3B.
Yes.
Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B.
Somebody made a mistake.
That's right.
Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B.
Who has access to these files?
Only hospital personnel.
I want a list.
All right.
Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this?
This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing.
What were you doing at the El station... so late at night?
Why do you want to know?
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
"So, do you know what everyone is saying?"
What?
About how you and Angela had sex.
- Who?
- You and Angela.
No.
Who's saying that?
I don't know.
People. I mean.
"She told me the truth, of course."
What truth?
How far you guys went.
Well.
Yeah.
Because nothing happened.
"Right, so how come it's all over school?"
"I mean, you're not talking it up like some low-life..."
"derelict cretin telling everyone you did her, are you?"
J ust checking.
- H i Brian.
- H i.
- This is Gina.
- Hey.
- Right.
H i.
- Brian saw the entire thing.
I heard you actually chased the gunmen.
- Chased the gunmen?
- l would have screamed.
I have to leave the room when my father uses the electric knife.
"I think chase is a little bit strong, but I was going to check out the situation ..."
because you know if there's a gun--
No.
Very satisfied with the standard of protection you provide.
No.
Very satisfied with the standard of protection you provide.
We like to call it the Kane brothers' insurance scheme.

I'm looking for a shooter.
I'm looking for a shooter.
"Oh, what, to off someone, yeah?"
"Oh, what, to off someone, yeah?"
You are asking me and Les to off a bloke?
You are asking me and Les to off a bloke?
Or recommend someone.
No Docker.
Or recommend someone.
No Docker.
There's a drink in it.
There's a drink in it.
Eh.
What about old Mick?
Eh.
What about old Mick?
Nah.
Nah.
Mick Gatto couldn't hit the back end of a bull with a handful of rice.
Mick Gatto couldn't hit the back end of a bull with a handful of rice.
Gatto.
Nup.
Gatto.
Nup.
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
- What have you been up to?
- When?
All this time!
I've been looking out the window.
The window?
What were you looking at?
"Just looking, Barbuda."
I see.
How are you doing in school?
"The principal says that I'm behind, Barbuda."
Behind?
How come?
Didn't you showher how you can read?
"How you can draw, write and walk the tightrope."
Didn't you tell her that your mom made you study every day?
"Don't worry, sweetie."
You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Don't worry about that.
I miss you already!
I hope the circus comes by Rio de Janeiro again.
"Next time, I promise I'll bring Foguinho."
"Come on, my tightrope walker."
Barbuda.
Can you take me up there someday?
Ask your grandma.
She'll take you.
"I want to go with you, Barbuda."
Can you take me?
- Mom!
- Maria!
!
- Are you starting again?
!
"Why is Kobi screaming, honey?"
"Then who is that, Yitzhak?"
"Why are you crying, Yarivi?"
Your father called me.
He said he might want to come too.
Suddenly everyone's interested in me- I'm a celebrity-.
"It's all kosher, dear."
"Poor Jonah, my beautiful sister."
"She was better at everything else, but I could teach you how to cook!"
"So what are you up to, Aunt Rosa?"
What can I do?
I teach Hebrew.
"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?
- Are you better?
- What do you mean?
He's asking if you're better.
You said you were sick.
"- Me, sick?"
- Aren't you sick?
I'm as healthy as a horse.
This is in Paris.
"You came to visit, remember?"
Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?
- Do you remember?
- How?
I was only five.
Then how should I remember?
"If you divide 98 by 12, it makes $8 a year for her loyalty."
"Then throw in Señora Rodríguez, Señora Salcedo, Señora García--"
"Son, we have to have the sense of the community."
That's very important.
"- Tito understands that, right?"
- Claro.
Carlos:
Tito understands everything.
Woman:
You're a day late!
"Hey, Miss Mercedes."
Miss Mercedes!
Ah-ah-ah!
I need you at the other building.
- Can I clean up first?
- Later.
What's the fucking rush?
I told you we have to get these windows in by the end of the month.
Why are these cans in with the newspapers?
Didn't we have this conversation before?
- I posted notices on every floor.
- That's not enough.
"At the end of the day, you're responsible, not the tenant."
My man!
What's happening?
"- Maggie, my buddy Mickey."
- What's up?
- Mickey... and Daisy.
- Daisy:
Fuck you...!
"Daisy, what's happening?"
This is Berna.
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Can't say I blame them.
There's nothing I hate more than a damp cold.
Let's check this out.
Howdy folks.
Who are you?
Sheppard.
"This is Teyla, Ronon, McKay."
You from Matira?
No.
Over the mountains then?
A little further.
Then you've come a long way.
You'll be in need of food and drink.
Sit.
"Take it, you don't get many strangers around here?"
No.
Especially not those who travel near dark.
Why's that?
- You really don't know?
- Callum.
What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.
"It's been three months, how much longer do you think it will wait."
"Hi, what are you talking about?"
The Daemus.
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.
Yoon.
"Yoon, he said the crack doesn't look good."
It looks retouched.
The photo is unrealistic.
Okay.
One more thing
"I am sorry to bring this up, but you forgot to erase the finger of the guy who's lifting the athlete's leg."
Shit!
Don't try to make any excuses.
Shitty work is shitty work.
Shitty work because you suck!
No excuses will do.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Are you listening?
Yeah.
About Adidas.
The 2nd lot.
"The set with the girl, they want to take a break."
Who's doing it then?
Nobody.
It's just a break.
Just a break?
No such thing.
"Who is doing it, Je?"
Jerd.
Hello Peng.
"Hey, I heard you lost it?"
You heard about that?
"Even though I'm in another office, when Je got chewed out, I knew about that."
Accidents happen sometimes.
But some people who are hit by car once are handicapped for the rest of their lives.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."
A dream house.
"That controls the automatic functions, breathing, sleeping, wakefulness, intestinal functions."
She can open her eyes but as a mechanical action.
"Her brain is dead, she's got no ideas or feelings."
Come in.
"Hey, you!"
Come on in!
"Yes, you."
Hello.
- My name's Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga.
This is Alicia.
- Was it your first night here?
- Yes.
The first is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
What are those boots for?
They stop her feet from twisting sideways or falling forward.
- They look like Ibizan boots.
- Do they?
I've never been to Ibiza.
I know you.
From my writings?
No.
It was at the theatre.
We happened to be sitting together.
I didn't notice.
At one point you started to cry.
I told you about him.
"He cried watching ""Cafe Muller."""
I have to go.
So soon?
We haven't had a chance to talk.
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.
DOC:
Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.
Now just hold still.
That's it.
Don't move.
There.
Now that's my good girl.
Candy.
That's for you.
Take it.
That's it.
Next.
What is it this time?
Want me to take a look?
Depressor.
Now that's a big boy.
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."
- I never check up on me boarders.
- Your daughter's checking on him.
Right.
Right.

Sure.

"Know that, Mr Trimbole."
"Know that, Mr Trimbole."
Enjoy your lunch.
Enjoy your lunch.
When's that?
When's that?
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
"Alright, see ya."
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.
"We tried calling you, but the armada must have knocked out all communications."
[grunting] [both] Huh?
Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."
"Hey, let me get two more."
And one for my buddy.
"Oh, man, you remember this?"
How could I forget it?
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Yeah.
"Hey, you wanna get your sidekick under control?"
"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."
Robbie!
Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?
"Yeah, I got it."
Bi Boo!
What are you doing?
Can't you speak clearly?
You have to say each word clearly.
Bi...
Boo...
Get out of there.
Let me try.
What?
The chair's too small for 2.
I sit on you then!
Why don't you sit in the middle.
Bi Boo...!
I got it...!
Bi Boo...!
"Here's a police car, get in!"
Hurry up!
"Sit tight, here we go!"

How do you know my name?
I've listened to you sing so often...
Who are you?
I feel as if I know you.
I know you can't see too well.
"I've wanted to help, but I never had the chance."
"In this world, not everybody is untrustworthy."
Will you let me help you this time?
Is it all right for me to leave?
Stay calm.
Let me check it out.
It's only a cat.
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture.
What a pain!
- Why did you turn off the light?
- You can see?
I only see shadows.
It was better last month.
I could see images.
Turn on the light.
It makes me feel safer.
What are you doing now?
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
- Then say it!
I want to wear my old dress!
"Oh, dear."
"We'll look for work, even something on the street!"
Why?
Where'd you get that fur?
Where'd you get this?
I ran into an old friend.
- And he told you about me?
No.
- And you let him give you furs?
- Yes!
But I can't give you presents?
"Franz, let's dress like before and look for work."
You're not gonna tell me who it was?
I made that up!
Where'd you meet?
On the street?
While I'm risking my neck and showering you with money?
"Get away from me, you tramp!"
You tramp!
Damn you!
Get out of my sight!
I'm out risking my neck and slaving away like crazy!
Franz!
Let me go!
Let go!
This is my home!
Leave me alone!

"Fine, I'm shouting."

Noon.

Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."

"- Mike, you ettiriyorum promoted."
"Tomorrow, Rook'a to LA'ye I want you to aid shipments."
- Why not?
- Too much fun.
My daughters house beats.
Always use stops.
I do not trust him.
"- Well, Rook is a party man."
- So.
He carries the goods under the counter.
I stand here and had to protect the interests of Arment'in.
The problem is that not only protects their interests.
Arment'e tried to say but I did not listen to me.
What can I do?
The man's son.
So we need to go to the shipment to go somewhere I want to sağlamanı.
And all of them.
Mike ...
Like I told you:
"Hit me again, I said."
Do you remember?
Nobody knows what the girl has gone through.
But now we must speak about it.
"The truth - and nothing but the truth, so help me God."
Pauline Kraka.
"No, it's not for me."
I have only written here.
Poste restante.
Mr Harald Brennemann
I have no identity card.
- Maybe you have his forwarding address?
- Where has he moved to?
I don't know.
To the West.
"Brennemann, Brennemann..."
Brennemann...
Brennemann...
"No, but there are a bunch of letters there."
"Christ, no!"
- He never picked them up.
- He can still come by.
"- Please, I'd like to have them back."
"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."
"- But please, I no longer have an address."
They could get into the hands of strangers.
"Please, give me the letters."
- Please!
Baber's story checked out.
You guys are free to go.
"Huh, technically, I'm supposed to say that."
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You can tell them about the fertilizer.
"Well, it turns out Baber, being the frugal shopper that he is, bought the cheap stuff,"
So what you have couldn't even blow up a dollhouse. [ They laugh. ]
Uh-huh!
"Could not blow up a dollhouse, could I?"
- Challenge accepted!
- No!
No!
No!
That's not what he meant!
Thanks for letting us go.
And for not waterboarding us or making us stare at the moon.
- O...
K.
- OK!
"Let's go, you guys"
I'll buy you an ice-cream sundae for your troubles.
"Oh, no!"
"Sweetie, I'm fine!"
"Yes, absolutely, I'm fine."
They dropped the charges.
"Well, there really were no charges, so I'm a free man!"
What?
"Oh, that's great!"
That's great news!
Amaar!
Nanteuil.
What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.
"Fandor, my boy!"
My boy!
Juve?
Is that you?
It's me in the flesh.
"When Lady Beltham's hotel blew up, you were found dead under the rubble."
"This is what I have made believe, in agreement with the Director of the force, Mr Havard."
"Immediately after the explosion, several of my men were found dead, some shredded."
One of them was unrecognizable.
"Brígida Bonazzi. divine, it enters, Brígida Bonazzi, enters, enters, between..."
"Ah, you, Brígida Bonazzi are very good."
It will not do damage to him?
"No, it will seat to him either, it will seat to him very or."
"Oh, what pretty you are..."
You have paid attention?
"Small nose, small nose, small nose..."
Nothing is heard.
In the end that son of puta fuck really.
What is going to fuck that.
-You are very bad?
poor truth?
"-Who, I?"
"Oh, there are lost the memory."
"Calm, now you will see."
"Yes, yes, I want to see."
"Well, slowly, first I clear this to me..."
You do not hear anything?
Listening...
"-Thus, slowly?"
eh?
-Yes.
"Yes, now you will see pretty legs."
Thus...
Thus...
Fuck!
Now you are going to see.
"It quiets, you do not move, I am in charge."
-Let go.
I do not touch myself.
-It quiets.
You do not resist.
"Boy, what a night!"
I'm so glad that is over with.
"- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever."
- In sports...
Together forever.
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.
Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
I believe that my prayers will be heard there!
How can the medicine work when you are hungry?
Are you hungry?
You are starving for last two days.
And you claim that you are not hungry?
I wiIIjust come back.
"O God, I have looked for him everywhere!"
But I couldnt find him.
I dont know how he is doing now.
"God, you have bestowed me with everything."
But without him its useless!
"God, I want to find him!"
"Yes, I do!"
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
"Brother, please sit down."
Mr. Kirshna is going to serve the offering!
Master!
Master!
"What happened to you, sir?"
What happened to you?
"Krishna, ourfate betrayed.."
..us once you left us!
I lost everything!
Your madam also left me!
"Yeah, I know!"
I know!
"Sir, I know all of it."
You have met me after such a Iong time!
Master!
How is little miss?
He is Krishna!
Lamaze.
Is that where they do the breathing that ease the pain?
"Yeah, it actually works."
"You know, you breathe fast and then slow, you know, like..."
"I don't know, like-- like a dog or something."
I wouldn't touch that line with a road crew tour bus.
Do you remember everything you've ever touched?
I'm just saying.
"Gentlemen, seriously, this has been a pleasure."
"Don't hurt yourselves tonight, all right?"
Take care of yourself.
"All right, Morgan--"
All right.
Later.
"All right, everybody in."
Come on.
"Come on, let's go."
Ante up.
Ante up.
"""Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through."
"Life's been good to me so far."""
Joe Walsh.
Hey.
"Hey, beautiful."
How was the poker game?
Mmm.
Ah.
Broke even.
Oh.
But...
This little one chillin' inside your beautiful belly didn't do so badly.
Whatever that means.
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
I meant the other Mario.
I've abandoned him to his fate.
- He behaved very badly.
Did you send him the bill?
- I don't think now's the time.
"Do you think, they'll condemn him, Sir?"
- It depends on who defends him.
If it gets into the hands of any old pettifogger..
- He's toast!
"Poor Mario, he was so nice!"
- Isolina!
"Noble Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery!"
"No thank you, Sir."
I don't smoke!
"- Oh, sorry."
"- Excuse me, sister."
These clients are serious.
- Yeah?
- They have a ton of money.
They have the fuel.
- Praise God..
May he always be praised.
- Always!
"Bye, Dad."
- We must go now.
"Yes, sister."
"Be strong, Isolina."
"Blessed sister, you don't know what it's like to have two husbands."
"Be brave, daughter."
You'll see that you too will find peace here.
I have great need of it.
PRISON
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.
"More than snow, more than Simeon - even this old body is strong in my control."
Argh!
Do you feel it?
Winter is coming!
Argh!
Winter is coming!
"No, you must fight!"
"Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!"
Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN:
Why?
- To dance.
You know...
[ALL SNICKERING]
"Now, why would I wanna do that?"
- To free the penguin nation.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN:
Uh-huh.
MUMBLE:
By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey!
Bryan!
"Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time."
"Maybe after winter or something, okay?"
"No, that's too late."
Way too late.
Bryan!
You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
"But right now, I got problems of me own."
"Everyone's cranky, looking for biff."
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
"If you don't come now, multitudes will die."
Here we go.
You saying it's my fault now?
And to determine the degree of infiltration.
-Infiltration by whom?
-Alpha Draconians.
-Draconians?
Jaelen!
"Jaelen, what's happened?"
Jaelen...
"-They took it, Robert."
They took our baby.
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.
-It's safer.
- Our army is coming here to establish complete dominion.
It has always been our intent to shield you from this threat.
But we are entrenched in war and we haven't the means to bring the fleet here to protect you.
It is to be your darkest age.
"- Man, look at that."
Look at that.
Look at that.
That's amazing.
-Open that one.
-Wow.
-Open that one.
That's amazing.
Wow.
- We're gonna set the world on fire with this.
-And I think soon.
"- There, I got it."
"- Dude, we got a helicopter."
Right behind there.
See?
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
All rise.
"For his excellence, inquisitor general don Tomás de Torquemada."
I must send you on a mission I wish I never would've had to send you on.
(WHISPERS) Look.
It can't be.
Do you care for my daughter Amelia?
Of course I care for her.
"I'm here, dining with you."
(ISABELLA I OF CASTILLE) What is this?
Abraham Levi is under my protection.
"I believe that there is only one possibility left, and you know what I'm referring to."
Run!
Guards!
Obey.
No man will be left behind.
(SALVADOR) What do you think?
that I don't wish he were here instead of burning at the stake.
(WHISPERS) Destroy the diary this very night.
Quick!
She's here!
"Quick, hurry up!"
"- Hello, everyone."
- Hello.
Am I late?
No.
"I'm even early, it seems."
So...
Is everyone here?
"Oh, no..."
I see that...
Our own Philippe.
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
Dale!
They threw gas bombs in through the gates.
All the guys ran up in the north cell hall.
"Now, the National Guard's out there with machine guns and gas masks!"
Did I say a picnic?
You two guys get in that cell.
Okay.
Why don't we give it to them right now?
We may need 'em later.
[GUNSHOTS]
Any of you guys got a shiv?
He's got one.
Swell.
Screws with machine guns all over the joint.
We'll make out.
Out where?
"Why, through the back door."
"We pick the screws off the wall, get some rope at the twine mill and lam out!"
Let's go!
STACEY:
"Come on, get going."
Come on.
You guys go ahead.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
I'll make out.
I got something to take care of.
"Go on, beat it."
Put him in that cell.
He's done.
[GUNFIRE]
"We all go together, Stacey."
[ENGLISH ACCENT] ...hello?
"- Oh, good, Portugal's here."
"- We saved that wall for you, Christine."
"Oh, great."
"Oh, I get the whole wall."
Okay.
Just set up.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
Exports.
Imports.
Portugal.
"Yeah, you know, Christine, you don't have to stay."
I'm sure you have a shift to run off to or something.
"Oh, no, no, no, I don't work shifts, Marly."
"I assign shifts to people, because I'm the boss."
I have a corporate credit card.
I've got 35 points accumulated.
"Two thousand more, I get a flashlight radio."
[LAUGHING]
[CLEARS THRO AT]
So you wanna open up the bottle of port?
Heh.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh.
"- You don't have any vodka, do you?"
"- Yeah, where's Russia?"
[LAUGHING]
You know what would help?
If you could set out the plates for the international feast.
"Oh, sure."
"So, I have this new guy cooking for us."
Others?
I do not know.
Are all there ...
It is sad.
Addons last question ...
"Addons What's the first, purchased by you,"
"This site us, and why?"
How the hell do you know?
Buying goods online.
Addons Let me refresh your memory to tell you.
I've never bought anything like that.
What's this?
"Addons you score ""zero"", Max."
I've never bought anything like that.
Addons The correct answer is ...
Addons 1: you are at level 1.
You fall for the exam 7 times.
Addons 2:
"Profile of the most frequently visited is ""Leeps Jennifer""."
Addons And you've seen pictures of 234 times.
Now obviously.
Addons Question 3:
Your order solution genitals.
Addons Once you come from Poland.
He was 17.
"Addons short: dirty people like you, interesting disease."
Well done.
Confidential.
I do not buy it.
"Addons Gwen, your question starts now."
I do not think that there is a game.
Problems that are too personal.
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
"Hey, Sarge."
"Having a ball, huh?"
Did those meatballs ever figure on you coming in with six stripes?
"(laughs) Knocked them over, huh?"
"I went over big, yeah."
"I had the suit pressed and everything, all real sharp."
Yeah.
"Big, big."
"Hello, Sarge, Rocco again."
"Listen, the motor pool is in great shape, so just relax and have a ball."
"Hey, Sarge, they really flipped, huh?"
"Look, this is costing you guys a fortune."
You better hang up.
I'll be seeing you soon.
Take care of yourself.
Give my best to the gang.
"So long, Rocco."

Here you go to believe.
"Do not believe this about me, major lord!"
Towards a dawn Mariska's limbs started becoming stiff.
Ágika was refreshed again.
He was Tót in the baddest state.
His brain rumbled.
His sense organs stopped working.
He hallucinated.
It was light.
"I think, his time to go to bed."
This was superb one.
We felt very well.
- I hope for it tomorrow we continue.
- Of course.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Major lord.
Sweet dreams major lord.
"Sleep tight, Ágika."
Mom.
He kissed my forehead.
What do you say to this?
"We have to go to bed, my sweet good Lajos."
"Ow, my Gyula, my Gyula."
My small son.
"Well, not wonderful, mom?"
He was not tired.
"With regret inform it the Hungarian Red Cross, that yours son, Tót Gyula is an ensign in the fight against the enemy, died a hero."
(Field post 809/3)
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
J.D. :
There.
There he is.
[vin GRUNTS]
[BOTH grunting ]
We've got some unfinished business in Texas.
JOSlAH:
All right.
Take him away.
I know you wanted him alive.
You did what you had to.
I can't clear my name if I'm dead.
Well...
"... youwin,Mother."
You alwaysdo.
"Well, of course, darling. I've known you since you were an itty-bitty baby."
That's always gonna be my trump card.
That's a mother's advantage.
"Now, come here and give me a kiss before I leave."
EZRA:
You're leaving?
But your place is a gold mine.
It's booming.
"Well, that's the whole idea."
You buy a depressed property.
You get it going...
... andsellit at  the height of it's popularity.
I made a fortune.
"Spend it in good health, Mother."
"Oh, I already did."
I reinvested it in another very depressed property.
You aren't.
"Yeah, true."
Might as well.
How'd it go with the sponsors?
Not well.
They love you.
They just don't think it's a great fit.
What did they say?
They weren't impressed with your last fight.
"I told them you were sick, but the real issue is the stuff with your dad."
Ryan.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, Lisa?"
I already went to fucking prison.
I know.
I think it's just getting people to understand what you've been through.
It's none of their fucking business.
That's personal.
I don't want to talk about that.
Maybe there's a way to do it that doesn't suck.
Let me think about it.
All right.
[Indistinct chatter]
Alvey:
Yes?
[Door opens]
Mario Goldsmith's here.
"Oh, yeah, send him in."
- The poison pen.
"- How are you, Alvey?"
I'm great.
I'm great.
Have a seat.
Thanks for coming.
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?

You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's
Stop it!
Hyo-ijn!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.
These youngsters...
You know how my wife can get...
Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"
Don't shout.
I need a driver.
"Can, have you gone nuts?"
Yourfoolish aunt didn't tell me...
"Thanks to Ahmet, she doesn't know."
Come in...
Come in.
-Of course you're sorry.
is that your signature?
We record the receipt of all documents.
What about phone calls?
You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.
Glamour.
"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."
Maybe we can nominate them.
I thought it was all cut.
"Cut, not cut."
Politics.
Nothing's cut.
Where you going?
I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
Just hold your horses.
POLICE RADIO:
Something came in for you at 3813 Hanover Lane.
You're to proceed...
Hanover?
That's where I just was.
What the hell is this?
A damn merry-go-round?
[Tires squeal]
[Siren wailing]
[Tires screeching]
"No, this is Burris."
Let me have Detective Donaldson.
"Richard, we got a problem over here at Audrey Matthew's."
"Uh, you better get the boys from the coroners."
"Yeah, that's right."
I don't know yet.
We haven't had a chance to talk.
"Just get on over here, huh."
[Siren wailing]
"Well, girl, what happened?"
Who is she?
Electrocuted.
She was electrocuted in the bathtub.
I know.
I saw.
But how did the curling iron fall into the tub?
There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.
"When I saw her, I thought she was healthy."
Saw who?
Who was in there?
"- What, you got bumped?"
- No.
"Mm, they, uh, found a girl with better hobbies."
Would you quit?
No.
I decided not to be on that list.
Because...
"Well, just because."
Don't feel like you have to cancel your blind date.
I'm not going on that date.
"- Oh, what, she blew you off?"
- No.
Right.
"She saw your picture, huh?"
I just didn't feel like going out tonight.
With her.
Great.
Yeah.
See wanna have dinner tonight?
Yeah I'd like that.
"All right, this is perfect."
Johnson?
The corned beef here is addictive.
"Look, I won't tell your dad I saw you here if you don't tell you saw me."
You can tell him whatever you want.
Can you hear that?
- I can't hear anything.
- exactly.
- I told you it wouId be different.
- City life.
"- Seen it, done it, bought the T-shirt."
"Normal saline, wide open."
"Four milligrams morphine, IV Push, PRN."
"Immobilize that spine with a collar, side head supports, and straps."
Be very careful.
"Okay, that's a roger."
The respiration is rapid and shallow.
"Oh, yeah."
Easy.
Did he say anything about who hit him?
"No, man, he didn't say anything."
Easy.
There we go.
Sugar.
"Ollie, he's going to crump on me."
Can you...
Do you want me to pull over?
"I got it, I'm styling."
Just get us there.
Watch for Mary.
Listen for her bell.
It's a death bell.
"I'm bagging away here, but I'm getting airway resistance."
Has his trachea deviated?
"Big time, to the right."
Fudgebar.
He's going V-Fib.
"The fun never ends, huh?"
Clear.
"Come on, Danny."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're back."
"Liz, get a cutdown tray ready for chest tube insertion, please."
You okay with this one?
You watch your job!
I don't understand him.
What's this man talking about?
"Come on, boys, don't be crazy."
Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still.
"-Boys, come on."
-No boys.
Look.
-Reproduction artists.
"-We are starting a new life, boss."
"-Here is the agreement, master."
"-""Group Biceps""."
-We are going down the artistic road.
-Therefore... we can fuck this job.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
"Excuse me, do you have some cursed, fucking job for us?"
And now we will play for our Rose from the canteen.
This is a magnificent feeling!
Splendid.
Indeed.
How does it work?
What's wrong with you?
"Well, what's up?"
Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.
And does yours work?
I can't see a button anywhere.
Maybe it's centrally controlled somehow.
A kind of central control.
Hallo!
-Everybody to Hawaii!
-wonderful!
-It will be a great holiday!
"-Grandma, Iet's go!"
"Let's go, please!"
Wait!
My mother also wrote...
"""Dear Grandma, Suzujiro told us to stay at his home."
"""No sense staying at a hotel."
"""We decided to take advantage of his hospitality."
"""It is such a big, magnificent residence."
"""We are just loafing around."
"""The garden is beautiful, and nothing is better than the ocean-side view."
"""Grandma, please do come!"
"Yoshie."""
Look!
It's a gorgeous home!
It looks just like a hotel!
Here's another letter.
"It's from clark, Suzujiro's son."
It's written in katakana.
"Here, can you see it?"
"""Dear Aunt..."
"""I am the son..."
"""of your eldest brother..."
"""Suzujiro Haruno."
"""Ever since my father..."
"""came from Japan..."
"""to Hawaii in 1920..."
"""he lived with the pineapples..."
"""and he will soon die as an American..."
"""leaving me this vast farm."
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
We're cleared here.
Surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
"- No, ma'am."
All secure out here.
"Boss, this isn't a meth lab."
So why an escape tunnel?
Need to take a look at this.
Hotchner.
When?
Did they raise the terror alert?
"No, that's probably best."
"All right, get everybody in now."
I'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just have to go to the office.
"It's 6:15, and you're talking about a terror alert?"
"It's bad, isn't it?"
I don't know yet.
Please don't lie to me.
It might be.
I may not be home tonight.
"I mean,"
- I might be home late.
- I know.
Shoot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we... scheduled to take Jack
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll reschedule.
-ls the mission possible?
"- lfwe were given this mission, it is possible."
Do you understand what all this might end with?
"If everything is all right, I'll get the USSR Hero Star."
Posthumously.
"No, everything is all right, comrade mayor."
Everything is OK.
Everything is all right.
is the line from the Chapayev movie?
And I'm not good at singing.
Neither am I.
Join in.
-And I do not know any more lines.
- Neither do I.
Still go on singing.
Let's go overthe same line again.
"Marysya, sweetie!"
is it him?
"-Misha, is that you?"
"- Master, it is us, Grisha and Valera."
Bloody hell!
"Folks, you are wet to the bones!"
"Take this, warm up a little."
"Take, please."
-What about yourfriend?
- The friend can not afford this.
Why so?
"Everything is all right, auntie."
"Comrade captain, we are sorry."
"Please, do not get offended..."
But we will not untie you so far.
"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."
"Look, it's 14 to the right, then you go twice around to the left 'til you come to 22..."
And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?
"Those two bums, that fuckin' whore..."
They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?
"Hell, no..."
You kiddin' me?
"Hey, look, I swear."
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
Hold on!
"You gotta be kiddin', buddy, I got your message."
"This fuckin' guy's crazy, man."
Wait until I get that fuckin' Johnny and Tony...
I'm gonna cut them both off.
Somebody get me out of here!
Get me out!

"Hey, wait-wait a minute..."
"No, no, what are you doin'?"
Are you crazy...
Don't do that!
Stop it!
"Jesus Christ, don't!"
"Please, please, don't do that."
It was a brand-new cigar.
You stay here.
"If you notice something odd, whistle."
Whistle?
Don't you get it?
I gotta get out of here!
- Shut up!
- I gotta get out!
- Who is that?
That isn't one of our cars!
- Another car!
Someone ratted us out!
- Seems to be the police.
- Police?
"Get out, rat!"
He's not gonna rat us out again.
- He has learned his lesson.
- I told you he's gonna cause trouble!
"What was that, Karl?"
"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?
- What is she doing here?
- She even wanted to call the cops.
You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.
- What happened to Franz?
- They snatched him.
Who?
That can't be true!
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
All right.
He's the one I'll go after.
Wait a minute.
It's cold outside.
You'll freeze.
Here.
I'll lend you my fur.
Hasn't she prettied up the place?
"Wait till you see how gentle she is, and good as gold."
You have everything you need at the bar.
Enough about the bar!
Here she comes!
Hide and don't make a sound!
"Stop right there, Mieze."
You have to swear first.
Swear you won't look behind the curtains.
"""I swear..."" Come on!"
I swear.
"""I swear I won't look behind the curtains."""
- Fine.
- Good girl.
"You got me another present, didn't you?"
Don't buy me any more presents!
"Why not, sweetie?"
We have everything we need.
I have my dress.
You have your things.
Why do we need more things?
Because they're nice to have.
What is it?
Franzie...
I have something to say.
"How you doing back there, Sam?"
"Not good, Mike."
We think he was out too long.
"Okay, clear."
Yeah.
"Come on, buddy."
"Come on, buddy!"
Clear.
"Come on, Schmidt!"
"Come on, man!"
Wake up!
Wake up!
Oh!
There we go!
There we go!
"He's back, Mike!"
We got it!
"J-j-Jabbar -- Jabbar, is he --"
Don't you worry about him.
We're wrapping his sorry ass up right now.
Was I -- was I dead?
!
You really want to know?
No.
"No, I'm good."
I'm good.
"But...just a little -- yeah, you were a little dead."
You were dead.
Counterintelligence usually starts as a subtle game of cat and mouse.
"Your adversary pretends not to be watching you, and you pretend not to notice, but the longer it goes on, the more inevitable it becomes that you'll end up in open warfare."
"Afternoon, Mrs. Westen."
Oh.
- Goodbye.
- Hi!
What faces!
- We were worried.
Knowing you were around here alone...
The town's dangerous.
- It's not Iike milan.
- Not at all.
- Where were you?
- Around.
- Here?
- I was looking for a perfume shop.
"There aren't any here, there's a town store."
- The NannineIIa.
- It's not a perfume shop.
"- If you ask, what'II she say?"
"- ""No, not on yourIife."""
"What can you expect, we're in the South, right?"
"In CasteIIabate, right?"
"And I'm an idiot, right?"
"Darling, wearthis, they might shoot you."
Think she knows?
Get out of my sight.
I tried to tell you the truth so many times!
"- The alcohol, friends, mandolin?"
- What?
"It's true, cholera, threats, ""I sacrifice formy family."""
- I said what you wanted to hear.
- I don't get you.
"We've created a strange magic, it's been better since we separated."
"So, we'II continue being separated."
You have to forget about Chicco and me.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."
What would your father say?
"Look, Betty, I don't care about that."
- Come on.
- Outings leave me cold.
"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"

I need... to kill her myself.

And she's even got sexy feet.
Feet?

Million Dollar Baby is totally unrealistic.

It's not sexist.
It's just truthful.
Girls can't pull trucks through snow.
- Can you pull trucks through snow?
- I absolutely could.
- You can barely walk in the snow.
- Excuse me.
Time out.
Is the truck parked in neutral?
- Hey!
"- What, dude?"
Empty your pockets.
- Now.
- Okay.
"Hey, let's just all stay calm."
Nice friends.
Maybe... one to two inches of snow?
- One to two inches...
- And a Ford F-150.
Right.

Maybe I could pull it four feet.
- I'd give him four feet.
- I'd give him five.

Stepson!
I didn't realize that you two were close.
We were talking about the collection.
"I was interested, of course."
"100,000 Euros,up..."
Sorry?
I was just saying... no matter.
Georgina!
Have you seen Dawn and Sophie?
I've lost them.

"Ok, for starters, I have Jeffrey Anderton upstairs eyeing out my collection like it's a fucking yard sale."
Anderton!
Is that what this...

Those are my paintings.
Give me the fucking key!

Yes.
Yes.

I'm calling about the response to my ad.
Is this Professor Morgan?
"No, this is her sister."
Rose doesn't even know I answered the ad.
"Well, then maybe we shouldn't be talking."
No!
"Please, it's just that Rose would never answer an ad herself."

He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
Go down the hall.
What happened?
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
Drink it in.
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.
"I know, right?"
"All right, boys."
Your turn.
Let 'em dangle.
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.
Count of three?
One.
"Two, three."
"You guys are awesome, man!"
That's not even necessary.

He fell right there.
The others are in grave danger.
GUARD:
The Governor is here to see you.
I'm not receiving visitors.
You have not heard what I have come to say.
"When this is over, Philippe, and justice has been served, you'll pay for how I have been treated!"
"I am a son of France, a prince of the blood."
And yet you lock me up here like an animal!
(CHOKING)

We don't have much time.
GASTON:
I take it the King doesn't know about this?
No.
You really think it's necessary to go after them?
"If it's the slightest chance they are walking into a trap, yes."
Is he in an athletic tank?
"""An athletic tank""?"
Yeah.
"I believe that's the nice way of saying ""wifebeater."""
"That's the new way of saying the ""W. B.""?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"Where I'm from, they call them wifebeaters because everyone on ""cops"" was wearing those."
"That's... by the way, everyone calls them wifebeaters."
Okay.
What's the new thing...
"""Athletic tank""?"
"""Athletic tank"" is what it says on the package."
[ Laughter ] Is that a network...
"So, if a guy had, let's say, a classic land cruiser, what would you think?"
I love that car.
Like FJ40?
Yes.
I had one.
Really?
Is it for sale?
The last one I can think of...
And this is just off the top of my head...
"A guy with, say, a 1983 Honda Civic Wagon?"
Just picked that out of thin air.
Ah...
Totally redone.
No.
Right.
Interior/exterior?
"Yeah, plaid interior."
Plaid?
Get away from the clown car...
- Nate:
"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."

She shouldn't have to bear witness to your hate!
You like that?
!
It's the hose of justice!
- The hose of just... oh.
- [Stops spraying]
"Well, obviously, I'm not gonna spray you."
How can you defend him?
"He's a pediatrician, for god sakes."
We trusted him with our children.
"Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand."
Don't use us as propaganda!
What are you guys doing over there?
Get in here.
- We're on the right side!
"- No, you're not!"
"Fine, you're gonna have to spray..."
"Dad, I can't believe you sprayed... aah!"
Protestors:
Ohh!
Aah!
Get in here and get changed for the wedding.
What the hell?
!
Seriously!
Aah!
We've got you on camera.
You're gonna regret this.
"I'm leaving, after all."
But you're watching me climb down the stairs.
"But you saw aunt go upstairs, I didn't."
And both of us didn't see her going downstairs.
Right?
Err?
"Right, all right."
"You'd rather take the left, and forget the right."
Listen to me...
Yes?
I have something important to discuss with you.
About the rent?
Forget the rent!
Forget it?
Really?
Sure.
But I have a condition.
You must do something for me.
What is it?
You know I've been alone since my wife died 20 years ago.
I've never missed female company earlier...
I've heard that one before!
Damn these rickshaw-drivers!
Now listen carefully...
I always do.
That woman and I...
Which woman?
Laxmi...
I see my wife Mangala in her!
"She has the same eyes, same features... same gait!"
I swear!
This is an action replay!
"Look, it's a little after 6:00."
I'll catch a ride and see you out there.
Bye.
- John.
- Yeah?
"The Balkans peace council is ""comprised"""
"or ""composed"" of ten members?"
Twelve members.
"Oh, right."
Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
"- What do you think, Cy?"
- I'll lead with it.
- Great.
I'll see you Monday.
This'll make them sweat.
It's good.
What?
- I gotta go.
"- Come on, John."
"It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party."
I can't.Mary's waiting for me.
"It's a big house, isn't it?"
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.Take a look around.
So you two were in the room then?
Were you sleeping together?
- Did he tell you he slept with me?
"- No, I'm just asking."
What did you do then?
I don't talk about that kind of stuff.
I see.
But how did you get out when I was outside the door?
Ask him yourself.
Did you two by any chance walk over me?
We came out anyway.
So you walked over me?
Why is that so important?
We got out and that's it.
"You're mean, Sunhee."
Two women shouldn't be fighting dirty over a man.
The choice should be the woman's.
This is so boring.
This is why hell is so boring!
Don't get mad.
I'm fine.
So you really are just a woman.
The phone has been turned off.
You'll be connected to...
Moonsook.
Where the hell are you?

"Whatever it is, it's really knocked him for six."
I think I know what it was.
- Really?
Pilchards.
What?
- They must have been on the turn.
"Well, don't look so worried."
Anyone can make a mistake.
Why won't you take my money?
"If you hadn't allowed us to pick your fruit, we'd never have made all this."
I'm not going until you let me pay for it.
Not for the WI and not for you.
For the fleet.
It would be lovely to see you at our meeting this evening.
"Busy, I'm afraid."
All the more reason.
Everyone gets so much from it.
"Without it, I sometimes think I'd curl up in bed and never get up."
Hello.
"Thank you, driver."
"- That's all right, miss."
Excuse me...
"Oh, Mr Wilson."
Er...
Spencer.
Hi.
Would you like to try some of our jam?
Why not?
I helped make it.
Try that.
Mmm.
Delicious!

"Can you alter these, make them a bit longer?"
Certainly.
Would this be long enough?
"Welcome to our store, Please watch your step,"
I'm really sorry.
"Oh, sorry."
Are you alright?
Yes.
How about tonight?
Uh...
Dinner.
It's a Greek restaurant.
You'll love it there.
But...
Can you wait for me at that cafe on the corner when you finish work?
I have to go home now.
"Of course, don't worry."
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'm only a bit drunk.
Are you alright?
You were so drunk.
Did I...?
Why don't you take a shower to freshen up?
Where is it?
"Come over here, princess?"
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
"Clearly, I"
Will go sailing

"Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?"
"What, dear?"
What was that?
Never mind!
"Buzz, the coast is clear."
"Buzz, where are you?"
There's a secret mission in uncharted space.
Let's go.
Really?
That is so interesting.
"Would you like some tea, Mrs Nesbitt?"
Buzz!
- [Piano]
- Notthat.
[Stops]
Buddy?
I have always stood by you.
I campaigned foryou when I was pregnant.
"During Checkers, when Ike wanted you out, I told you to fight."
"This is different, Dick."
You've changed.
"You've grown more bitter, like you're atwarwith the world."
You weren'tthatway before.
"I'm 50 years old now, Dick."
Howmany millions of miles have I traveled?
Howmany millions of peoples' hands have I shaked that ljust don't like?
Howmany thank-you notes have I written?
"It's as if I, I don't know, justwentto sleep a long time ago... and missed the years between."
You shouldn't play with people's feelings.
Is that real what you do on the phone?
Isn't it just another game?
"We're just mammals, too."
Sure...
It's good exercise and it pays well.
Do you think we could live like this on a nurse's salary?
"Phone sex is hygienic, impersonal and funny."
There's food in the kitchen.
Hello?
I love your voice.
What's your name?
Jes...
Mr. Yes.
- You'll never be lonely again.
Lusty Terhi will help you.
What's wrong?
"Fine, Mr. Yes."
You want to listen?
You're on top of me.
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Kiss me all over...
I'm taking your ah...
Isn't this great?
"Are you still there, Mr. Yes?"
"I'd like to - love, for real."
Me too.
Time to go home.
Tired?
"No, this is fun."
You're a strange Finn.
They're usually as lazy as monkeys.
"Okay, guys, come on."
"Let's go, seriously."
We can do that later.
- You okay?
-Yeah.
(PANTING)
"Thank you, Peter."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Now we're even, stiff."
All right.
"Come on, let's go."
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.
"- No, no, no."
-What?
The box.
We have to get the box.
"What, are you kidding me?"
"Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris."
"Four, you have to listen to me."
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.
We have to get it.
"Peter, is there another way into the lab?"
"I mean, I'd have to go into the control room to disable all the doors."
"Okay, good, then do that."
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
"You just chose our side, whether you meant to or not."
"If you wanna survive, make sure we do."
Let's go.
- Yeah?
- What do you call this then?
- Interesting!
- Wow.
Who's that from?
- Hannah Fields in the year below.
Sniff it to see if she rubbed her fanny on it.
Neil!
"Na, just a bit of perfume."
So what are you going to do about it?
Nothing.
Apart from making sure Carli doesn't find out.
I think she'll be too busy sucking on her boyfriend's knob.
- Shut up.
- What?
"All I'm saying is, he'll have his cock right deep in her gob and then in her vag."
"Out the vag, back in the gob."
Thanks!
"Oh, yeah, that reminds me."
Give that to your mum for us.
Are you serious?
"- Oh, you are."
- Don't tell her who it's from.
"No, course not."
"Anything else, Neil?"
- Would you like me to ask her out?
- Would you?
Let me think.
Would I?
No.
"No, I fucking wouldn't."
Good morning.
Says he picked up his personal effects.
What about the super saying they fought?
-We're gonna work on that in a minute.
"-John, this guy gets zero rhythm."
Zero.
"Razor, shirts, couple of pictures."
"Which would kind of be what I told you, right?"
-You were only there once?
-Right.
-Super says you were there twice.
-Let's break that down.
Super says I was there twice.
He's a liar.
Says he heard fighting.
Maybe he did.
She had scumbag friends...
-... that'swhysheworkedforus.
-We're getting different stories.
You say you were not there before you went to pick up your stuff?
"-Correct, for the second time."
-You altered a crime scene.
You admit lying about it.
"Hey, John, don't talk to me like some street skell here."
"You guys want to screw me for this, you go ahead."
I'm done talking to you.
-Yeah?
MEDAVOY:
Mrs. Fuentes?
-Yes.
-Detective Medavoy.
Detective Martinez.
-Your husband spoke to Detective Kelly?
Your silence has saved your life.
Until now.
"Now you need us, and we need you."
There's only one way to catch that maniac.
Hold on.
By offering him something he can't refuse.
You aren't serious!
We have no other choice.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
He wants to use you as bait.
You what?
- It's your only chance.
Put me out there like a piece of meat.
You came to see us.
Don't get her involved!
She already is!
You wanted to solve this case.
Not at her expense.
And we'll solve it.
Always you!
And if it's the last thing I do.
You just can't be trusted.
What?
Here's a package.
Speak up!
Who's it for?
"For you, lnspector Minks."
From somebody named lrezumi.
I'll put it here.
Car keys and a parking-lot ticket.
No.
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."
How many copies to you want me to buy?
.
-What?
How many letters?
.
-What's that?
Five!
Five!
Five!
He's pestering me!
"Yes, okay!"
"I'll call you later, wait!"
Hey!
You're such a pest!
Give me that!
Hey!
Give that to me!
I'm going with them.
I love you.
But I want to experience life in Canada.
You know that long distance relationships are hard.
Self-mutilation is an expression of a child crying out for help.
Wait a minute!
"I've read all the books, too."
I haven't seen a child crying out for help!
This is such crap!
He's a wonderful kid.
He's perfect!
- Too perfect.
- There is no such thing.
There is in children with psychotic tendencies.
"So now we have Ted Bundy, Jr."
Is that it?
"Look, Rachel."
I know you're hating this.
I'm hating this.
But your son has a problem.
"Why are you doing this, Shawn?"
- I'm trying to help.
- You don't want me to be happy.
That's ridiculous!
Stop denying the situation.
Enough.
That's all.
"Let's go, Rachel."
- Rachel--
- No!
Don't say it.
We have to do something.
They're too close to it.
Did you see any marks on his arm?
No!
I can't believe Shawn is doing this.
Where're they!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Go!
Wait
Where're they?
I let them go
You idiot!
What are you talking about?
You're wrong!
I'm a martial arts practitioner!
Get him!
"Master, the foreigners at the leprosarium have withdrawn suddenly"
Hurry!
Ask our men at the leprosarium to withdraw too
I want to save and set them free as well!
Someone set us free!
We want revenge!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang!
Fight the Black Tiger Gang to death!

About sebastian?
He awaits you in your throne room.
Brother?
Francis.
I'm going to tell you something.
And it will hurt.
I know you're here to elope with mary.
You don't need to.
"All that nonsense about the prophecy,"
It's gone now.
My mother's let it go
For reasons she can explain.
I'm going to tell mary.
"She'll talk to my mother, to nostradamus."
She'll be convinced.
She won't trust catherine.
I don't trust catherine.
"You don't want things to change, to revert."
You're going to play on mary's fear.
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.
She turned to you because she had to.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.
You know it.
And now you know
"Ours did, too."
You're lying.
You entitled son of a bitch.
You.
You're nothing.

Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
"No, I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery's in progress."
Emma.
Swan.
Good name.
"So do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
- Excuse me?
- Hey.
Eyes on the road.
(Horn blares)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"You didn't, actually."
(Siren whoops)
Oh.
Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""eyes on the road."""
Screwdriver.

This is very soft...
like velvet.
Naturally.
It's pure silk.
"It cost us 4,000 Rupees."
"Sleeping in this is so much fun, as if..."
"As much fun as it is in your husband's arms, right?"
Don't take of fence.
I said that only because...
"I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere silk, on a mat with my husband."
Hand me the pillow-cover.
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.
Must be your elder brother then?
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.
He was my husband.
Was?
Is he no more?
Gosh!
Don't say that!
Have you had a drivorsh?
"It's ""divorce"", aunty."
Not drivorsh.
He's pretty good looking.
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.
May I say something?
A young couple can separate... but parents must never be done apart.
Never mind that.
Go and see what Bharti is doing.
- Yes.
Where coffee beans come from.
The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.
Is it?
Interesting.
- How do you do?
Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.
"It adjoins this property, and would be a desirable addition."
- I'll ride there and speak to...
- Gibson.
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.
Have I hurt you?
Thank you.
Forgive me.
That was my father's favourite.
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.
I enjoy her company.
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.
"Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?"
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know.
She's off to China soon.
"I'm to go as her servant, on the understanding I'll be badly treated."
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.
Which will take precedence?
!
I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."
- When will you tell me what you did?
- When will you tell me what you did?
- Are you starting again?
Size?
"Is this a five or a six, Ursula?"
Ursula?
What?
Sorry.
Neck size.
Is it a 15 or a 16?
16.
What is wrong in cooking his favorite dish?
"Senthil, has Thangam opened his shop?"
"No, he has gone to Peelamedu for ear boring"
"Oh Casanova, Don't pinch my heart"

"-That doesn't matter, you dance"
"Stop it, this is my house, who are you?"
- Is it house no 1 3?
-Yes
- Are you Paramasivam?
-Yes
- Wanted someone 'for ear boring'?
- Yes
- I am the guy -ls it so?
- Tell me for whom I should do
- For my girl
- Is it her?
What is this?
Her nose and ears has already been bored
Why do you want to do again?
That is all old style do you know the latest style?
-What is it?
- That is at the navel
- Cat?
- Mm-mm.
- Bird?
- Mm-mm.
- Wolf?
- Mm.
"Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?"
Just a cat.
Just a cat?
You never talk about your patients that way.
"What, you have to put one down?"
No.
I wasn't going to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- You promise you won't get mad?
About a cat?
Why would I get mad about a cat?
"It was Adalind's cat, and I know that you don't like her, and she knows that too."
She didn't even want me to tell you.
Let me see that.
"Nick, what's the matter with you?"
Take it easy.
How long ago did this happen?
"Today, just before lunch."
"Baby, I get scratches all the time."
Not like this you don't.
- You don't understand.
"- Yeah, I don't understand."
You're getting all worked up about nothing.
You don't know her like I do.
Okay?
"You know, you said that once before."

Cheers.
I feel quite good.
Eh.
"What's going on here, then?"
"Ah you know, man..."
The winds of change.
Rivers of blood and all that.
"Shit getting wild, man."

- Yeah.
Where is Sid?
He came early... with Michelle.

It looks like you ran afoul of somethingNwith wicked claws.
And I'm still dreaming.
What did that to you?
-Banner or Bander...
N-The Bandersnatch?
I'd better have a look.
What are you doing? or it will fester and putrefy.
I'd rather you didn't.Nl'll be fine as soon as I wake up.
At least let me bind it for you.
-What do you call yourself?
N-Alice.
The Alice?
-There's been some debate about that.N-l never get involved in politics.
You'd best be on your way.
What way?
All I want to do isNwake up from this dream.
Fine.
but that's the end of it.
Coming?

Simply great!
I deeply regret to have called you.
I won't make this mistake again!
A lady has come to see you.
"All right, come"
Didn't I say I'd drop in someday?
And here I am.
You did say.
But I never expected you.
I don't know how to welcome you.
Anybody there?
"Yes, sir?"
What would you have?
Hot or cold?
Any cold drink.
"- Two cold drinks.- l will bring now, sir."
How is your father?
is that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.
He is my only friend.
Which is why I have kept his photograph.
But the walls in this room are still empty.
Why don't you fill it up with some good photographs?
Shall I ?
"Yes, Mr Daaga?"
What's up?
Don't you wory.
What am I here for?
So what ifyour men are guilty of murder?
I am there to save them.
See this bungalow!
I sold it to Dick.
- Hundred grand.
It's his problem.
- I don't think so.
"Numberthree, which is probably the most important of all,"
I'm leaving tonight for good.
"Now, questions?"
[ Tires Screech ]
You fucked up the whole thing!
You screwed it all up!
- Stop it!
- You brain-damaged fool!
"God, and i picked out a car and everything!"
"Hey, now listen."
"If I didn't do this, we'd be in jail or at the river bottom..."
- with bricks taped to our wrists.
- [ Groans ]
- And you know it.
"- Oh, my God."
You're so stupid.
- Oh!
"- Oh, Crystal."
- We are under surveillance.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Yes.
Last night I stopped by a convenience store.
"A cop pulled in behind me, he got out, he followed me in... and then he pretended to get a cup of coffee!"
Did he pretend to get a doughnut?
"- Oh, you know--"
- You are nuts!
- You need to see a psychiatrist.
"- Oh, I'm nuts?"
Ah.
"Yeah, I-I wouldn't know."
She and I are
Keeping our creative lives separate right now.
"Uh, you might wanna discuss this one,"
Since it involves her going to Haiti for three months.
"You know what, dad?"
I think I'm gonna have to cancel that waffle.
Okay.
All right.
See you.
Hey.
Um...
"I know this gala tomorrow night seems boring,"
"But I thought, uh, if there's a girl you like,"
Perhaps you'd like to invite her.
"Actually, I'm gay."
"So if I was going, which I'm not,"
Then my date would be a guy named Elliot.
That's cool.
Uh...
Bring Elliot.
I'd love to meet him-
Please stop acting like
You and I have any kind of relationship.
You're right.
Um...
I have a lot to make up for.
I'm sorry.
The window for that
"Closed somewhere between my 12th birthday and, um..."
My suicide attempt.
We didn't even get the Joni Mitchell.
"Oh, don't, yeah."
Food and Drink.
"Food and Drink, OK."
I can tell you you will be looking for cocktails.
You have ten seconds to confer.
OK!
Single word ones.
Single ones...
"Mojito, screwdriver..."
Erm...
Time's up.
I didn't hear a lot of cocktails there.
Are you not big cocktail drinkers?
They are.
These two love them!
But we like two-word cocktails!
That's a bit inconvenient then.
Yeah!
"Simon, in the middle, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, remember those passes."
You're looking for cocktails.
Reveal the hive.
Mojito.
"Mojito, correct."
Helen.
Screwdriver.
BUZZER
"Oh, you are locked out of the hive!"
"With 32 seconds left to go, and two passes to go!"
"You wanted to get screwdriver there, but you can't quite get it, because there's no R. Bad luck."
You've got one point for mojito.
"No hat, no problem."
Another score for the cat fan.
Hey.
Hey.
Want some necklace?
"How about you, man?"
Ew.
You got it all spitty.
Tastes better that way.
Good.
"Hey, Harriet, what are you writing?"
Notes.
Can we read them?
Can you read this?
"Okay, okay."
I just wanted to know why you're always writing like a maniac.
I want to remember everything.
I want to know everything.
"Well, you must realize, Harriet, knowing everything won't do you a bit of good unless you use it to put beauty in this world."
True or false?
True.
Of course it is.
"Harriet, your mother called."
She's going to be late.
"Come on, Sport, Janie."
I'll have you home before dinner.
Golly always takes us places.
She sees things other people barely notice.
She's my nanny and...
"well, she's Golly."
"Okay, survey of the day."
Today's question is:
- You think he's been acting a part?
- No.
He loves her.
I am sure.
- Of course!
Has he left her any assurance of his return?
Ask if he proposed.
No!
I cannot force a confidence from Marianne.
Neither should you.
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.
There was something underhand in his manner.
You will think the worst of him.
I give him the benefit of my good opinion.
He deserves no less.
I am very fond of Willoughby.
"I get next game, okay?"
-Coming through.
Coming through.
"-Doctor, is he dead?"
"-Please, get out of the way."
-Dr.
Greene...
... canyouconfirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
-Not for a second.
-Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
"Well, good."
I'll deposit it and bring you your receipt.
"Now, that's twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at two dollars."
That's right.
Looking for a stock to buy?
Why?
Do you know of a good one?
Have you heard of Wentworth Drug?
I don't use drugs.
How much does it sell for?
Two dollars.
I never buy cheap stocks.
"Well, this one may become expensive."
Somebody just bought twenty thousand shares.
"Yes, so I see."
"You just bought twenty thousand at two, Mr. Sabourin."
Thank you.
You bought it.
What if it goes down to a dollar?
Then I'll buy more.
Look.
Still think it will go to a dollar?
I've got to get some.
Mr. O'Hara!
"Yes, Mrs. Ryan?"
Get me fifty thousand shares at two.
You'll never get it at two.
Not after that announcement.
Look!
Three and a half...
Three and five eighths...
Three and seven eighths.
Don't you notice the smell?
I can't stand it.
What a terrible experience!
It smells like something died!
"Haven't you noticed it, too?"
"Yes, but there are several tanneries around here."
- Tanneries?
- Tanneries.
"If they're tanning hides, it's the skin from the ass."
- A tough one!
"- Stop, I can't stand this stench."
Stop!
I think it's coming from that guy in the back!
- Are you going to leave me like this?
- Wimp!
"Dear God, it's not fair."
A dog!
"Quiet, I'm Dr. Cicchirini!"
See that?
I'm getting better.
You look like a fisherman at a taco stand.
"- Now, watch this."
- Not bad for a beginner.
In the corner pocket.
"It's up to you, Benito."
"Come on, cheer up!"
"Come on, play."
- Let's see what he can do.
- Now you'll find out.
"- What are you doing, Benito?"
-What's wrong?
Guys...
There should be a number on it.
Ask Mace to look it up.
"Pretty, isn't it?"
(Sighing)
"Stop worrying, Howard."
There's hundreds of them.
And don't forget who's paying for all this.
"That's right, yes."
I'm suggesting exclusive rights to it all.
"I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
"No, I'm not going to sell them individually."
One moment.
"- We do want the world, don't we?"
- Of course we do.
And don't forget America.
"Yes, the world."
And America as well.
"Yes, good."
What?
"Oh, yes, splendid."
That would be grand.
Goodbye.
"Well, that should take pressure off Carter."
- Did they say yes?
- And at a very good price.
"Oh, Pops, you are clever."
Howard will be so pleased.
Let's have a drink.
LACAU:
It is outrageous.
They are behaving as if they own this country.
How dare they give exclusive rights to The Times?
- Good day.
"- Uh, no, I meant the young girl."
There.
- This is our niece.
She is lodging with us while my cousin's family is away overseas.
- I remember you from my first visit here.
Do you know my sister Isabel?
- She's a shy girl.
- She's very shy.
Very shy.
- Are you okay?
- I'll be there.
Go on.
"Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick."
"Best to the sister, yeah?"
Be well.
"You know, Isabel,"
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.
"Dr. Cairn says that your progression has been remarkable, so not to worry."
- I know my brother won't be pleased.
- You're a strong girl.
You don't need his approval.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Mr. Porter.
- Roderick.
"- Isabel, what are you wearing?"
Huh?
"Your fingers, they're filthy."
- I know.
- Who did this to you?
Why'd you have to leave me?
I can't explain that.
"(LINE RINGING, PHONE RINGING)"
"Hi, honey."
How was breakfast?
Did you tell Dad not to contact me?
(SIGHS)
It's not that simple.
"When he called out of the blue,"
I said that now might not be the best time.
You could have told me that last night.
- I'm tired of all these secrets.
- (HANGS UP)
- (SIGHS) - (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)
"So, who were you on the phone with basically at dawn?"
"- Hey, fun story."
None of your business.
- Always so mysterious.
"Look, maybe we should go get breakfast instead of breaking and entering?"
- I'll spring for pancakes.
- No pancakes.
"Ooh, wait!"
"Hey, frame me up."
"Maybe use, like, a Dutch angle so it's creepier."
I got it.
This is it.
"Oh, what?"
The unit was already unlocked?
Crescent Palms guy was hazing you.
We'll see.
- You recording?
- ‭Yup.
!
I'll get you some.
"Do you want plain ones, or ones with our address on it?"
Address on it?
!
How many sheets?
"Well, how many are you going to use?"
Manager!
Just enough for one?
Tell me.
Manager!
Manager!
Yes?
Testing...
testing...
There you are.
I've never met such insolence in my life!
"I come down here to get some lavatory paper, and she starts asking me the most insulting, personal things I've ever heard in my life!"
I thought she wanted writing paper.
"- I'm talking to you, Watt!"
- Watt?
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.
I've never met such insolence in my life.
She said people use it in the lounge.
"- Yes, she thought..."
- Then she starts asking me...
"- No, please listen..."
- Appalling questions about...
I can explain.
"No, you see, she thought you wanted to write."
Wanted a fight?
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

There was previously a scene there with Mike and a transvestite.
- You can catch that on the DVD too.
"- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
- In the deleted scenes.
- That's what I was recovering from.
"Are most of the scenes that are deleted on there, or did you pick and choose?"
We got a great scene with Kat and Jesus.
We've got Trannie Tris.
- Thank God.
- Trannie Tris.
- All the oldies but goodies are there.
- Do you say:
"- ""When I say 'Jesus' you say 'Christ""'?"
- That's in there.
Yes.
- That was fun.
- Yup.
Do you have the bathroom scene at the?
In the Catholic school.
Is that in there?
"- No, I'm afraid not."
- No.
"- That was kind of omitted, right?"
"- Oh, God."
- That was fun.
By your command.

"What is it, lord Tyranus?"
I have done as you've asked.
Asajj Ventress is dead.
"Once again, you've proven your loyalty to me."
You took quite a beating there.
"Didn't you, missy?"
Which side of the battle was you on?
"Not too talkative, are you?"
Take me to Dathomir.
"Now, why would anyone want to go there?"
Ain't nothing there but fog and witches.
Exactly.
We don't like strangers.
I'm not a stranger.

"Well, the DA defines murder as one human killing another so technically, you can't commit murder, can you?"
Does this make us friends?

-You.

"'Cause someone else got here first, right?"
Someone who didn't want anyone to find whatever was in here.
"So, that means there was definitely something to find."
Right?
- Oh!
What do we have here?
"- Hey, hey!"
You can't just take that.
- It might be there for security.

"- First, this is new."
"Second, that thing over there is for security."

"- She wants to see me, Damon."
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.
You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.
Oh.

I wanna meet her.

She found me after I turned.
"Genetic curiosity, I suppose."
She would be fascinated by you.
Is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
- Who's my father?
- Not important.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns?
Something like that?

"Yes I am, Ms. Walker."
"Dad, he had another kid."

So you are one of those silent types.

So that means you are interested in me.
Right?

"Actually, I have come with someone else."
So...
Oh.

Or put my hand around your waist?
What happened?
Oh...
You can't dance.

Rather he has a new master.

"Don't go yet, little slave!"

- You?
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
OK.
- OK.
Thanks.
- I hope I get to meet him soon.
- What?
Your boyfriend.
"If you want to keep things private, you got to avoid Noreen."
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for the intel.
I was surprised to hear you were in a relationship.
I just would've assumed you'd say something.
- You're...
You're fishing.
- You're evading.
It's only fair.
You know all the details in my personal life.
"Besides, what's the big secret?"
Is he bald?
A hunchback?
A member of the Green Party?
He doesn't exist.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I lied because I...
"Well, I had to because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are..."
- They do?
- They do.
- But we're not.
- I'm aware of that.
"Every time I tried to tell Noreen, she thought I was lying..."
So you made up another lie.
You'd make a very effective politician.
- Who's on first?
- Sick one.
Frank Chambers.
"Forty years old, severe chest trauma when a walkway fell."
Wrecking-ball crane collapsed.
"BP, 80 systolic, but headed the wrong way."
"Tachy 120, denies LOC."
Crepitus on right side.
Page Surgery.
"- Mr. Chambers, can you talk?"
- Hurts too much.
He thought his ribs were broken.
- You are?
- His secretary.
Sustained a facial lac and chest pain but refused treatment.
- You need to be examined.
- After.
He's decreased on the left.
- Let's hear it.
- I've heard it since Michigan Avenue.
"Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib fracture with dislocation."
F. D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop.
It's a kiosk!
"- Abdomen's soft, non-tender."
"- Vitals normal, tachy at 120 with a liter in."
- Gave him ten of MS.
- Don't touch!
It hurts!
"Okay, bear with us."
We'll give you something.
"- Oh, God!"
Did you hear me?
- Einar?
- Yes.
- Second row.
- Thanks.
Here you go.
"Come, let's go inside."
"Sunday, February 20th 1944"
Thanks for last night.
Thank you.
"Remember, you can come visit me as often as you like."
"It's not that far, and I can come get you."
No choice?
We could sink the ship out on the sea!
- Not according to the British.
- I don't believe them.
"- Well, tell them."
- That's what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way."
Taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is already onboard.
The ferry departed several minutes ago.
- You went for the ferry all along.
- That's not true.
Of course...
Then you'll be done with all this shit  and you can finally go back to Norway.
- Two coffees.
What do you want?
- Juice.
- Good morning.
- 39 barrels down.
This time...
You've done them justice.
Congratulations.
Take your apron upstairs.
Great job.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

I'm trying to be a good person here.
I'm trying to be a good son.
I'll tell your mom how fabulous you are.
I'm trying to show her that I have responsibility as well.
Okay?
But you're doing something responsible.
You're-

Because you took me to have a good time with my friends.
- Yeah.

He writes and draws

Alright

Who's this guy?
Figani
He's a good poet.
His tongue and also pen are sharp
I'll have to remember that.
Trevor?
Can I ask you something?
Should my lawyer be present?
Why are you always leaving me such generous tips?
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?
And entertainment.
- Entertainment?
- You.
"Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship."
"Sorry, I..."
It wasn't meant that way.
"If you really want to spoil me, take me to a movie sometime."
That's a deal.
"My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass."
I'll get it.

You won't go to Tangak_ I will.
I said you can't go to Tangak_

Hey!
Hey!
Mister!
Hey Mister!
Stop your car!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
Hey!
Stop!
Hey!
Next up there...
Carlos.
They will be the local authorities.
Good morning gentlemen.
We came from the Balkans.
This is the king of Belgium.
We are a diplomatic mission.
Excuse me?
He is Albanian.
She does not speak Italian?
We are in Albania.
How 'in Albania'?
"Oh, I do not believe it."
Are you sure?
- Yup.
Let's go down and ask for a phone.
"Carlos, what happened?"
- They'll be the currents.
How 'the currents'?
- There are so many currents at sea.
Well then we go down.
We went to Montenegro.
There we bought a boat there.
We were to get to the sea.
"No, excuse me, in Italy."
The captain of the Albanian port was not impressed.
He smoked a lot
While Ludovic tried to explain the situation.
But nothing to do.
"For him, we were just the sociable."
- Can I have a glass of water?
Please...
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
Trust me.
This is it?
What do we do now?
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No matter what you see... stay in the car...
until I say.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where's your son?
Where's Jasper?
Look.
This is about me.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't go after my son.
You people killed my wife.
Isn't that enough?
A basic rule of covert ops... is let someone else do your dirty work.
Let someone else find the guy you want to kill.
Oh-
It's a great technique... as long as you're not the someone else.
Move!
Move!
Where's your son?
- What?
You come here to kill me and now-
- I'm not here to kill you.
- That woman out there is.
- Who's she?
I need you to stay away from the windows.
- Where is your son?
- He's not here.
I sent him to stay with friends.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Don't hang up.
"Look, I'm so sorry about before."
I think...
"God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?"
I really need to talk to you.
Anna?
Anna?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
Why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Have you seen my keys?
"You can't wait to get back to her, can you?"
Can you just please help me find my keys?
What did I do?
"You didn't do anything, Kim."
You're amazing.
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.
Here.
Thank you.
Yan-ling was killed by the Wu-tang.
Which one of you killed her?
- We didn't kill your sister.
- Liar!
Your sister was killed by someone else.
"Trust me, we're friends!"
I ain't your friend!
I'm your enemy!
Yes!
Use full strength!
Stop talking!
Fight!
Go!
"Ming-kai, use 8-divine Sword."
"Wu-tang, why didn't you use full force?"
How did you know?
Go on!
Why did you intentionally miss him?
How did you know I missed him?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Yes!
You better not play any tricks!
We won't.
"It's just a contest, so there's no need to kill each other."
Nonsense!
What do you mean?
Mean?
Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine sword are both impressive.
I can't distinguish which is better.
That's why I invited you both here.
I want to know which is better.
FINN:
Maybe.
Or-
Or what?
The camera took a picture ahead of time?
(SCOFFS) Give me a break.
"I mean, just look at it."
"The placement of everything, my canvass."
Your canvass has looked like that for months.
"(WHIRRING) Uh, hey, guys."
"(CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRRINGS)"
(BULB POPS)
(WINDS DOWN)
No way.
WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
This was last Wednesday.
Remember you broke the mug with your four-iron?
"Oh, yeah, right."
Thursday.
Friday we went to the movies.
"Saturday we lost power, used candles."
Sunday.
Monday.
"That's tonight, Tuesday."
Tomorrow.
Bullshit.
"Mr. ""B"" invented a camera that takes pictures of the future, and he only used it to look in our apartment?"
Doesn't make any sense.
"Well, maybe he's testing it."
"Yeah, and this thing isn't exactly portable."
"Well, he's a scientist, so there's got to be some sort of logs or documentation somewhere."
You're supposed to be on lookout?
What's goin' on?
We're trying to find a way out.
"But everything's locked from the outside, and these locks,"
I just never seen anything like them.
"The walls are concrete, and I was telling the guys"
I think the windows are palladium-
- Palladium plated.
"Actually, that means you can't break the windows."
We're just double checking.
"I know what it means, Connor."
"Don't fucking start with me, man."
All right?
I've got this under control.
What about calling out?
Nothing works.
"Cell phones, walkie, everything's, there's no signal."
"This is really fuckin' bad, man."
"Ah, Goddamn, I think I broke my ass."
You got a gun?
Yeah.
- Well let's use it.
- What?
Get out of the way.
"- No, no no."
- Get out of the way.
"Ah fuck, Riley."
"Shit, what are you..."
"Ah, stop."
- Shit.
Just stop.
Look.
Come on.
I wanna have a talk with you.
Doesn't that make you feel proud and dignified?
"Oh, boy."
"Hey, that's a honey of a dashboard too."
"Strictly airplane type, Mr. Taylor."
"- Yeah, airplane, huh?"
- Mm-hm.
- Good-looking cigarette lighter.
- Yes.
- Does it work?
"- Sure, it works."
Try it.
You get 18 miles on a gallon with this car.
That ought to mean a lot to a man in your circumstances.
- Oh!
"Yeah, heh, it works all right."
- Sure it works.
You get more for your dollar than in any car in this country.
- You'll want delivery.
- I won't know till tonight.
- I'm getting a new job and a raise.
- Congratulations.
I wouldn't wanna sign till they tell me.
I'd hate to see you wait too long.
This is the only light-colored phaeton.
Tell you what.
You got my number.
Give me a buzz.
- Be glad to.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Why is he nosing' around?
"Oh, great."
Goons and government.
That's big time.
"That's mob, Thomas."
"Rick, I am not jumping to any conclusions."
just 'cause it looks like... just cause it looks like he is a government witness.
Whoa.
Roger's a mob stool pigeon?
"Bullets flying' all over the place, and you got a race?"
"You really believe her, huh?"
Rick!
"Okay, okay."
"I told you I'd check it out, and, Thomas, I will check it out."
"Um, Thomas, listen."
I thought after the race I'd throw a little celebration.
Like a congratulation gesture.
"Yeah, yeah."
Just us guys.
Yeah.
And maybe a couple of TV reporters.
"You know, a human interest story."
Get a little publicity for T.C.
"You know, war buddy helps pal."
Yeah.
TV reporters.
"And how about some wire service stringers,"
"Rick and a couple of photographers, Life Maga..."
Thomas?
Thomas.
"Magnum, it's here."
Ta-da!
not a clairvoyant.
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.
Go inside now!
asshole.
This is private property.
it is.
I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai.
Where are you keeping the old man?
Hmm?
Is he over there?
Or is he there?
That'd be smart.
I'd like to meet him.
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.
what happened back east.
He's been dead for a year.
I need the girl.
What girl?
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
There's no girl here.
I know you went to the motel.
I was called there.
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.
Just the woman.
Such as she was.
you saw Gabriela.
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.
did you?
did you?
I asked you first.
Your old man gonna be okay with this?
Don't worry about him.
He's fine.
"Yeah, I won't worry about him when he's ripping my fucking dick off."
Do you need me to sign something?
Good.
Relax.
"Look what you're doing with your shoulders, right?"
It's...
- Right?
- Okay.
Don't be wild.
And turn it over.
Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."
You're not leaving yourself any room.
"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
Excellent.
Hotel Lunik.
What can you do for us?
"Hi, we're with Hannes."
We're supposed to take some photos here.
I have a list of names.
Could you round everyone up?
I'll take care of that.
That'd be great.
"Photos, of all of us?"
With or without the mask?
He likes to wear a mask.
Is that alright?
"No, not at all!"
With the mask!
Alright!
I'll be right back.
Very nice.
"The man in the mask, in the middle."
Everybody a little closer together.
Are you a part of the group?
Why doesn't your boyfriend join us?
Why doesn't your girlfriend join us?
Why don't you both join us?
Come join us!
They can make fools of all of us.
It'll be good for you!
Come on.
I'm just a guest.
This time you're the subject.
"The more people we have, the livelier it will be."
Very nice!
Please leave.
If nothing had happened... there is no need for you to get furious.
Manoj!
Manoj!
"Manoj, open the door!"
Open the door!
Hello!
Where are you going?
You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.
I'll tell what I have to tell at the police station.
I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
"Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one."
"I might lose that even identity now, because of you!"
"Keep going, Panju."
Will you drive recklessly just because you are cop?
Can't you be careful?
Where is your helmet?
"Let's go, Panju."
"Sorry, man."
Idiot.
He went inside!
How do I always find one like this!
Hey!
Inspector Arivazhagan?
"Well, congratulations, sire."
We have a champion.
Good.
Where is he?
They haven't found him yet.
- Is that good?
- Yes.
That's what makes him a champion.
I see.
"They will find him, won't they?"
- You must be very proud.
"- Proud, you shit?"
Shit!
- Isn't that a great honour?
- Maybe he'll get the honour.
I'll get a dragon's tooth up my bum and a shilling-a-year pension.
I'll have to sit vigil with him all night as well.
"Christ, what luck!"
I promised my body to a woman tonight.
Maybe I could go and tell the lady that...
Wait a minute.
Maybe you could do it.
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady...
"- No, no, not that."
Sit the vigil.
- Me?
"I could give you my hat, my cape."
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.
- I can't do that.
It's not right.
- l will take you to Bombay.
"- No, no!"
Brother...
"Unless I don't work hard, I won't get the fruits."
Fruits?
I can see the fruits that you've got.
And about that back-breaking drill that you spoke of what is that?
- That was about parades!
- l see...
So you call it parade.
And what do you do?
- Love!
- Love?
"That's only part-time, brother."
"Otherwise, she studies too!"
I can read you too!
Your height is 6 feet 2 inches.
Your chest is 42 inches.
You like light-brown clothes.
You have an import-export business.
And you don't know swimming...
"Enough of it, Pooja."
"No, Pooja...don't!"
"Brother, whose car is this?"
It cannot belong to you.
- lt belongs to a lovely friend.
- A lovely friend?
Or a girlfriend?
A lovely friend!
- You?
- l didn't see you here before.
I have opened this shop recently.
What!
?
I'm already married.
No.
You're not.
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
Yeah you said you bought a ring yourself at Woolworth's.
When times got hard he tried to send you back to Wales.
And he's disappointed in you?
He's a stupid bloody fool.
But he's not as much a fool as you.
He changed a name for Christ sake!
Where's your fucking self respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
I know you deserve better.
You?
You're the better!
Catrin I...uh...
Look I think...you must.
And I think...you're a drunk squalid bully.
Quiet!
Hush.
You are speaking of flight lieutenant Lundbeck?
Cha?
You know he didn't have any film roles under orders.
"They told me I would be good for ""Eagle Squadron"" recruitment, Sir."
He's desperate to get back in the air.
Poor boy.
Tea sir?
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?
This fabric isn't so fire resistant.
They're my family.
My blood.
We have to practice thoroughly before the performance.
One tiny mistake leads to a break in the neck and...
She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?
What can I do to help you?
"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
"Please, do not do it"
"What are you waiting for, Mike?"
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
You coward.
"Good job, Mike."
"Now, I've been national i.ne."
Are you to be lachrymose?
!
"Okay, guys."
Collect them all.
Statues take him from here.
Come on!
Let's go!
I endorse this community.
Right there on the altar of a building.
"- I think the larger church take care of There are issues, Father."
- Right said.
One need not listen to confess.
- Hello Ms. Erin.
"- Good day, Father, Do you want to listen to a confession?"
- I listened to you last night itirafınızı.
- Listened to?
"- Yes, I listened."
- This is great.
Would you listen to it again?
- Of course.
- I was thinking about heaven that different layers.
- Yes?
Maybe my husband to a lower floor.
"I have another on the floor, if I can not be together."
- I think it is not a sin.
Just walk out from us?
He did all my homework.
Sit down.
So you did it?
I see you missed out on your education.
"""We walk""."
Walk doesn't take an 's' in the plural.
"Page 24, ""The blazing sun ripens the wheat."""
"Let me explain, Sir."
I'd like to explain to you.
What's the subject?
Wheat is the subject in this sentence!
Wheat is the subject and the subject is wheat!
So Napoleon said: 'Let my white panache be your rallying point'?
!
"Well, I did get my leaving certificate."
Stay right where you are.
Here?
There!
Open your books.
It's time for dictation.
- What are you doing?
- It's in my book!
Go and sit down.
Get back to your desk!
What's wrong with your book?
Don't panic!
Get back into class!
Time's almost up!
You can go home now.
You stay here.
I'd like a word with you.
It trusts me.
But you're going to put it in a cage.
It's cold.
It knows it'll get some crumbs in a cage.
Thought wild things liked their freedom
"Freedom to starve is no freedom, sir."
"Is that why you joined the British army, Harper?"
Maybe
Can't be easy to be Irish.
Wearing the uniform of England
"No harder than it is for yourself, sir, having to walk into the officers' mess wearing the uniform of a gentleman."
"You fight dirty, Harper."
"So do you, sir."
Morning Miss Teresa
Good morning.
"Morning, Lieutenant."
"Morning, Miss."
Hope you slept well.
I slept safely.
Thank you.
"Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir."
Do you smell danger?
I smell French cavalry.
Horse sweat and saddle rot.
- They were here.
- Nonsense.
Casa Antigua is ahead.
"My own people, they would have warned us"
Smoke.
Village on fire!
- My village.
Vamos!
- What's wrong?
- What?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
Hanging out with that... grunge poser.
He's beneath you!
- Why do you care who I hang out with?
- He's beneath you.
Let's not get started people hanging out with people... who is beneath them.
Are you talking about my cover girl?
"My sexy, gorgeous cover girl?"
Just look at her!
Everyone else wants to sleep with her or bathe her.
- Everyone except me.
- And what is that about you?
How you can see through her?
"- Hey, man you like this music?"
"- Yeah, I think that's great choose."
"Terrific choose, man!"
Yeah!
Take it easy!
You should go for Resin.
She's looking for you.
"- So, Resin was coming..."
"- Oh, hi!"
I assume this is finally my iced cappucino.
- Yes.
And your change.
- Thank you.
Geez!
You really sucked that puppy back.
Are you sure this was skimmed milk?
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.
To say sorry
I have to wait another month.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Goodnight.
- Don't you think you exaggerated?
- What organization!
- It went well.
"- No, she wants to stay."
- In CasteIIabate?
"- No, nearme!"
Then it can't be helped.
- How do I explain it was fake?
- tell herthe truth.
"Now that it's working between us, I ruin everything?"
You heard last night.
"In spite of everything, she loves you, why not be sincere?"
I don't accept advice from ajerk who can't tell his mother he loves anotherwoman.
Who said!
You're no betterthan me on courage.
I'II talk to my mom when I want.
You worry about talking to yourwife.
"So, I'II talk to my wife and you talk to yourmother."
deal?
- Lookin' for somethin'?
- The Post Office.
You have to go to CasteIIabate.
- We're in CasteIIabate.
- Not on yourIife.
CasteIIabate is up there.
- You're sure?
- I'II take you.
silvia!
Mrs. CoIombo!
"Here we are, I'II help you down."
- Thank you so much.
"Well... well, forgive me, but, you don't return my calls, you completely cut me off, and then"
I...
I returned to find this...
I'm...
- I...
I'm...
- What?
Speechless.
- I guess you don't like it.
- Don't like it?
I'm in shock.
I...
I come home to find a completely different woman in my apartment.
Why did you do it?
Wait a minute!
Why do I have to EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.
"- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband."
- You could've fooled me.
And I married a woman who looked a certain way.
"- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed."
- Betrayed!
Oh!
Please!
"Gregory, c'mon!"
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?
Why did you do this to me?
Do WHAT to you?
I don't do ANYTHING to you!
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I LOOK like?
You never looked at me ANYHOW.
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
"Madame George Sand, dear."
The authoress.
(coughing)
(horse neighs)
- Are you ready now to face me?
"- God, MaIIefiIIe!"
Not now!
"Yes, now."
No kisses?
Where's my greeting?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, MaIIefiIIe."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Come, we're going in."
There.
"So, please come."
Come along.
Good girl!
Always keep this finger straight.
"At most like this, always away."
Why?
To avoid the trigger.
People always have their finger on it.
It goes off and someone's dead.
There was just another incident in the army.
Some guy shot another in the neck.
"""Weapon malfunction,"" it says in the paper."
Malfunction?
He had his finger there and pressed.
And it fired.
"All shooters, 99% of them."
Hunters too.
always have their finger in there.
It happens so fast.
Your finger's the no. 1 danger.
"He picks up his gun, finger in there, and it goes off."
"You take it like this, with your finger out."
The animals hanging behind me...
This one here's an oryx.
That's an impala.
"A nyala, waterbuck, young nyala, kudu."
"Old waterbuck, white-tailed gnu, female Warthog."
"Gnu, bontebok, jackal, Warthog."
Jackal.
Two bonteboks and a bushbuck.
-Bail reports.
-Thanks.
Bull.
Right on time.
And in perfect order.
Billie. look how neat that is.
Yeah.
I didn't drool on it or anything.
Look.
Bull.
I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
Are you really gonna show me the bingo prizes?
"Just for you, Goten."
This way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
What was that?
"Okay, let's open this up."
Right.
Whoa.
Are these all bingo prizes?
Tsk tsk tsk...
"Goten, don't go getting surprised yet."
Click.
What's this?
"Oh, Goten."
Of course it'll hurt if you just rush in and touch it.
"Whoa, that's some tough security...."
Mum's invention.
She says that nobody will find the grand prize when it's in this.
Then we won't be able to see it either...
Don't worry.
"Mum's inventions may be great, but..."
See?
They've always got some sort of flaw.
"Great job, Trunks-kun."
"Okay then, I'll show you the grand prize."
Whoa.
I'm hungry...
"It's your own fault, Pilaf-sama."
We've had nothing but grass to eat for three days.
"That's a harsh diet, even for a dog."
Yes.
Right.
"Well, you-- you should go do that."
I don't want to keep you.
- Abby.
- Yes?
What are you doing here?
And why aren't you in uniform?
"Look, I really didn't want to talk about this here."
"I was gonna tell you all last night, but then I thought I should probably tell you at Sunday dinner."
"- Abby, you're rambling."
"- No, I'm not."
Isn't that that bitch from I.A.?
"Her name is Lina Flores, and she's not a bitch."
She's my partner.
"Well, she might be a bitch."
I don't really know yet.
I just started.
- What are you talking about?
- Partner?
I made detective and took an opening in Internal Affairs.
- You what?
- Does dad know about this?
No!
And please don't say anything.
This is so typical of you.
What is that supposed to mean?
Figure it out.
He--
Abby.
Those your brothers?
Both cops.
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.
- I'm open.
- Come on.
Move it around.
- Watch out.
Watch out.
- Hit my blocker.
Hit my blocker.
Can't feel it.
"Okay, put some mustard on this one."
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, man, keep it going."
"Let's do it, man."
Ten bucks for the first one who gets one past my glove.
L'll make it 50.
"Put that puck in the net, or we'll be here all night."
I am not pleased.
Cross!
Cross!
"Move, move!"
"Nice save, my darling."
Come in.
"Mr Mayor, thanks for driving over."
Never miss a practise.
Have you heard?
Newman failed a surprise inspection today.
This report should sway public opinion and clear the way for my purchase of the land.
What about the boys?
"Well, I love kids just as much as anyone, but..."
Excuse me.
"Do I need to install tampon dispensers in the locker room, ladies?"
Hit someone.
But there are...
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Slowly forward.
Two steps.
- Look to the side.
- Like this?
"No, left side to the camera, your good side, and now raising your eyes and turning as the Stuka..."
"Please, if you don't mind..."
Stuka.
- Johnnie is hit!
Can you bring the light over here?
Thank you.
"Could you move, please?"
We're trying to get big boy up there.
- Sorry.
- Tea.
Excuse me.
- Coming through.
- Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I thought that was really rather convincing,"
- don't you think?
- Very real.
"Oh, I say, are those rock cakes?"
Ooh!
They want to know when it'll be ready.
It's very much on its way.
"Only you keep saying that you'll be sending over the new ending, but..."
- It's almost ready.
- Oh.
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
It's the same shirt.
That was Haskell DeBray.
He was already dead.
Who was?
Don't let Serena out of your sight.
Hey.
Look up.
- What?
- Look up.
What are you doing here?
Brother wasn't the shooter.
That was a decoy.
The brother was somewhere else.
It's worse than that.
DeBray was killed five days before
"Serena disappeared the first time, in a hitandrun."
I saw the footage.
"It was him, Nico."
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
The real killer is still out there.
It's not over.
"You can just get into traffic cameras, just like that?"
- Public access to public security.
- Mmhmm.
That was the guy we're tracking?
"- Yeah, backwards, from the police station."
- Okay.
Shooting happened a couple minutes before 12:00.
Go for something on...
Broadway and Van Ness.
Hey.
"Mimi's vitals are Aokay, getting Aokay'er."
Is Lieutenant Papadol from Toronto?
Yeah.
Transferred here a few years back when he married a local.
Word of advice-- don't mention the Stanley Cup.
"Oh, park it there."
You looking for their horns and pitchforks?
No.
Yes.
Sorry.
We're checking out Roy Taggot and George Lee.
You know 'em?
No.
Good.
"Heads, you take Taggot, tails, Lee."
"Officer Taggot, Detective Kowalski."
So...
What happened last night?
- Read my report.
- I did.
"You spelled ""verbal"" wrong."
Complaint stated that you slammed a bar stool over Mr. Penn's head.
The guy was a jackass.
The guy was a jackass?
Seriously?
That-- what does that mean?
"Are you saying that's why you hit him, or are you just commenting on his personality?"
I'm trying to help you.
This isn't your first complaint.
You already have a prior for fighting.
Do you really want this on your record?
"Look, Taggot, I get it."
I do.
What now?
We chase them.
Chase them?
(GROWLING)
"Maintain our course to the south, the Philippines."
"Well, Tara... it took some getting used to, but this ""being a mom"" gig ain't naif bad."
I've waited a long time for this.
The time has come for us to return to our master.
I-
Eric...
I feel something.
Carol!

School...
"It's challenging, demanding, and takes a whole lot of work,"
"And it can be hard on your kids, too."
"Jeez, Brick, what do you got in here?"
This thing weighs a ton.
"Well, I told you, there's been a measurable increase"
In workload now that I'm in third grade.
It's really cutting into my reading time.
Okay.
Chicken nuggets...
Piles of popsicle sticks...
Oh!
An ant farm.
"Oh, sorry."
Ant cemetery.
Long long time ago ...
Very distant land ...
But not so far down the land do ...

To the benefit of that touching?
"- Good morning, John."
- Good morning.
- Do you have a swing?
- Yes.
John?
Do you have a family?
My father does not.
My mother in heaven.
"Sorry to hear that, Angel."
- I'm hungry.
"- Oh, yeah?"
"Come on, what there was in the closet."
"- Does not look good, John."
I spoke with Children's Services.
When you want said they could bring.
Oh ...
OK.
Sandman.
Golden age.
***
- Nice.
- Thanks.
So what are you pulling out of him?
"Oh,why do I have the feeling you already know the answer to that?"
"- That one,please."
- Okay.
Is that a Laurel wreath design?
It looks like some sort of badge or military medal.
"- Hey,did you see psycho there?"
"- Oh,yeah."
I have a comic book shop over on Columbus.I have every issue of sandman.
"Mint condition.You know,if you're ever interested."
I thought you said that you were her partner.
"Oh,I am.It's just,well,I also kind of have,like,a day job."
"- Thanks,Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
Grace.
""" Where are the bombs,Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended,Doctor,by all means,wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
My horse!
Why did you let the general escape?
"Go, look for him!"
"Don't move, your Highness."
It's me.
Henry from Bavorov.
"Oh, dear God."
Thank you.
"If we survive, I'll fulfil your every wish."
"Come, your Highness, down to the water."
"Bring back the general, dead or alive!"
"Too late, soldier."
"No, just a few more steps!"
Get to the water!
We must cross that mountain.
- It's a precipice!
"- Jump, don't be afraid."
Now he's trapped!
We'll drown!
"Please jump, your Highness!"
Now!
The devil took them.
"Look, aren't they beautiful?"
!
The finest in the world!
You can't eat toadstools.
Show me what you picked.
"All these, look, all beautiful..."
The red ones are poisonous!
Pick only the boletus!
So they're all ugly and poisonous and that's a red one too.
"No, that's an orange-cap, a good one."
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
"Right again, Mr. Monk."
An electromagnet.
Battery operated.
Strong enough to pull these six balls and only these balls up the chute.
"Well, we didn't put that there."
"Oh, Miss Teeger, please."
Don't insult us.
You started working here two weeks ago.
You had access to the equipment.
"Suddenly, your friend wins what?"
$106 million.
I suggest you both get good lawyers.
What?
This is nuts.
"Hey, Monk?"
Monk?
Have you got anything?
There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?
The truck driver?
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement.
I'm sure he did.
Waiter!
Yo!
There's something wrong with my glass.
It's empty.
You know what?
Hell.
Just bring the whole bottle and charge it to the room.
"I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy."
"Uh, okay, sure."
Why not?
"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Hi.
There's no need to interact with me.
I'm just here to observe.
What's he observing?
We're scientists.
We observe everything.
"Here, go buy yourself a scone."
All right.
- And what is your name?
- Angela.
"Oh, derived from the word ""angel."" Appropriate."
You're cute.
I'd like to buy a scone.
"Oh, I'm sorry, we're out."
We have muffins.
"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, just getting comfortable."
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
I...
They were out of scones.
"Sheldon, I'm talking to someone."
You're being rude.
I'll bet you're an actress.
"If not, you should be."
You have a very expressive face.
"Oh, my God."
"Wait, where are you going?"
Why did you go there?
Don't you get a newspaper at home?
You are changing the topic again.
You can try.
You cannot avoid me.
- Why did you go there?
- Shiv!
What's wrong...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
I am getting married.
Okay?
And he's just the type of guy I want.
"Intense, charming.."
Silent.
Silent in bed as well?
Stop your nonsense and leave!
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?
He's just your type?
He's charming?
What were you doing with me?
What were you doing with me?
"Tell me, what were you doing with me then!"
Tell me something.
Listen... please.
I won't do anything.
Listen to me.
I understand that economics is important.
"I am a banker, I understand."
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."

(RUMBLING)
Put down the prom baby.
(BABY WHEEZING) Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
(ECHOING) What's that?
You're broadcasting that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, I still have to... (WARNING ALARM BLARES)"
(GROANS)
Fuck!
"Henry, no!"
No!
(SCREAMS)
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me."
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
What the fuck was I thinking that Akan's toy robot was my friend?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife together, right?"
Hee hee!
You've bust it.
How fast were you going?
"In the car, it was 124. 9."
"More, and the other side will go."
No.
Ready?
That's it.
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '
I'm not quitting.
I'll have another go.
You better succeed.
One of the strangest things about being over 40 is that you start to want contestants on game shows to win.
"You also start to like game show hosts, even dressed as deck chairs."
Richard Whiteley!
APPLAUSE
Wow.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.
How much do you get for renting that out?
"Mind you, I'm not one to talk."
Let's be honest - really.
Let's do your career history.
Born up north.
Yorkshire.
Which is fine.
Educated at Cambridge.
Wooh!
Someone has to be.
You were the first person on Channel Four.
It isn't hard to find.
Is it true what the newspapers say?
That you never drive a car?
I never have to.
I was thinking of helping you... with communcations.
"Well, that should be fine..."
Now to test it.
Want to come with me?
"Yes, with pleasure, but what was the problem?"
Nearly nothing at all.
"Just old, I think."
The damned motor was stuck together with wire when I got here...
But it's been fixed.
I hope so.
"Enough, enough!"
Did General Cork send you to be my latin lover?
Enough!
- Confess.
"- Yes, yes, enough!"
"Forgive me, I was cruel, forgive me..."
Everyone is cruel sometimes.
"Hey kid, come here."
Let's go have some fun.
"Two, two!"
Careful.
"Yes, five dollars."
"You're disgusting, stay away from me!"
You depraved animal!
"Cretin, pervert!"
How can they do it?
"My god, how can they sell their own children?"
They're hungry.
Clamp.
Clamp.
Keep steady pressure.
3-0 silks.
3-0 standing by.
More gauze.
Gauze.
- Got it open.
"- Okay, clamp it."
"Here you go, doctor."
- Keep the pressure on.
"- Yes, sir."
Let's get some more gauze in here.
"Okay, she's under."
I want you two stationed right here.
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me.
"Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask."
"If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time."
"That's my statement, as it is."
"My god, Tony."
Nina tried to commit suicide.
"She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery."
Where is she now?
She's in the clinic being operated on.
Who's with her?
"Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated."
I saw her go under.
Who's with her now?
"Tony, who's with her?"
!
Damn it!
Which way did she go?
- Mr. Charles.
- Charles: goodbye.
We've got to do something about your...
- Your issue.
- Your narcolepsy.
What?
- You're going running again?
- yeah.
"That seems like that's all you do, regina."
You need to be out looking for a job.
Stop trying to run away from your problems.
What?
!
"Come on, mom."
What are you talking about?
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
"Well, if you can't hear me,"
Maybe i need to write it down
So you can read it.
"you need a job, regina."
Tell me something i don't know!
Don't you ever raise your voice
And use that tone to me again.
i am your mother
"And i will be until the day i die,"
And you will not disrespect me.
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm gonna go run now, ma'am."
Do i have your permission?
"Go on, regina."
"Lord, i ain't slapped nobody in 20 years."
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
Will all the competitors please assemble before the foating platform... for the dotting ofthe dragon's eye.
"It's our pleasure to welcome... the president of Tung Yuan Financial Corp., Mr. Tony Weng... the chairman of Rotary Club, Mr. Peter Chu..."
Cover him up.
Keep everything under control.
Red alert!
red alert!
Tony Weng's been shot on the foating platform.
The shot came from around the fishingjunks.
The killer is probably nearby.
All units!
Prepare to seal offthe area.
Mr. Weng fainted.
Everything's fine.
Please enjoy your day.
Chang!
"Chang, look over there!"
An explosion!
Let's check it out
"Chang, we can't lose him now!"
Freeze!
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.
Don't cry.
- He's down there!
Step on it!
- Okay.
- Any hospitals nearby?
- Think he's got a conscience?
He won't let the little girl die.
"Nurse, where's casualty?"
I have to get him.
I have to get him.
- No!
Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!
I'll drag him down to hell with drums and trumpets!
"The world can go to the dogs, every single man and woman!"
We're all going to hell with drums and trumpets!
You can't go out there!
We're all going to hell!
You're coming to the station.
You're Biberkopf!
We're all going to hell!
Don't ever come back here again!
REWARD!
MURDER IN FREIENWALDE
"Listen, wanna make some money?"
A pile of dough.
- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Hello?
Okay.
We will add numbers to the beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this?
"If it were a test, I could skip the questions I can't answer."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
Can you come down to the cashier?
Why?
What happened?
"This way, please."
The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock.
Where are you?
I tried.
I tried them all.
None of them worked.
That's impossible.
I am out of here or we'll get caught.
"No, wait."
Try again by putting them at the beginning.
"Ma'am, there was a little misunderstanding."
Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
"Actually, I was kind of in a hurry."
You've wasted my time.
"Come on, baby."
Let's get out of here.
It's not working.
None of it's working.
"Come on Uluc, work your head."
What password would a mathematician use?
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go and... all I could see...
was black... and all I could feel.
was the darkness above me and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then
I heard this voice.
like somebody whispering in my ear.
"""Wake up, number 37""."
"""Wake up"""
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright...
Lightning.
Something encircles me.
Don't bathe in the evening!
You could have a chest-congestion!
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.
Great woman!
She observes cleanliness even at this age!
"You bathe everyday, don't you?"
What do you mean?
"I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!"
Wow!
She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!
Jai!
What are you up to?
The water wouldn't flow the drain!
So I came down!
Jai!
What's that?
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!
It belonged to my mother.
When she died... my father asked me to preserve it carefully.
And what's that...
on your forehead?
"Eyebrows, eh?"
It's a dot!
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...
"""You have a necklace."
"Complete the picture with a dot""!"
You must wear it on your forehead.
Jai!
I'm here too!
"Talk to me, when you're through with her!"
5th Army Cameras!
Turn that... thing.
Oh my!
"General, there was a small accident but we'll go on."
Continue.
We better go now.
I'm sorry about that.
"I'm sorry, we better leave."
The ambulance is on its way.
"You can go, Jimmy."
You are the winners.
-What's the matter?
-A transfer instability.
It may be only temporary.
Something's wrong.
"Yes, you're right."
It's getting smaller.
-Can't you do something?
-I don't understand.
I don't understand.
But the Doctor's in there!
-It's your codes that are doing this.
-This is unheard of.
"-Well, how do we get him out of this?"
-A fault in the computation.
But there must be something you can do to put him right.
Take the machine to the Central Register.
What're you going to do with it?
"The Central Register, quickly."
There may still be time.
The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
"Henry, no."
I'm instructing... shit.
"Good job, Charlie Bronson."
Bravo 2-0.
Lights up.
Play video.
Dawn of Twilight... a cyborg era.
"Thank you, sir."
I've lobotomized everything not essential... not essential to soldiers.
"Personal memories, speech, sense of taste... it's all gone."
"May still have a bit of an issue with emotional motivation, which..."
Motivation?
"Try your fucking paycheck, James."
"My paych... yes, okay."
"- What the shit fuck, James?"
"- I'm sorry, sir!"
I'm so sorry!
"Oh, shit!"
Open the doors!
Please!
Open the door!
We've got a malfunction!
"Let me out, please!"
"Uh, I'll fix it."
I doubt it.
Fucking idiot.
"You know, Jimmy, something about a spine snapping... it never gets old."
- It sounds like...
"- The end, the beginning."
Or are they the same?
"Have a seat, Henry."
"When a man is first crippled, there's always one question on everyone's mind, especially his... does his dick work?"
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
"For the sake of my happiness, won't you let me have a month of my life?"
"Please Babuji, give me one month"
Go.
Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
"At Robbie's party, no?"
I don't go to parties.
- Great!
"Nor do I, ever"
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother.
"Like you, her eyes too had hues of yellows and blues"
Keep reading.
I only wanted to find out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
"Simran, you're here?"
I heard you've missed the train.
"- No, I took it"
I was afraid...
"Hot, maybe?"
Very hot?
What is this?
This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.
"-Heh, and this?"
My grandmother's earmuffs.
"Heh, look at them, lieutenant."
Everybody is a clown.
How do you expect to win the war mit an army of clowns?
We sort of hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yes.
"Now, outside, everybody!"
Everybody out for the blankets!
- Clear out.
Here we go.
"-Hey, you too!"
Outside!
Get going!
"Hurry up, boys."
"Oh, that Schulz pig."
He knew where the radio was all the time.
"Whoever that stoolie is, he's sure batting 1000."
Now the guy I want to talk to is Sefton.
Has anybody seen Sefton?
"Cookie, you haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Krause, you here."
"Hoffy, I'm very sorry about the mousetrap but the war news are very depressing anyway, huh?"
I might as well also confiscate the antenna.
American know-how.
"All right, let's hear it."
It's none of your business anyway.
No.
It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia.
It's lan McKnight.
Lovely.
"I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag."
"More to the point, we're just about done with the single."
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it.
Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it.
It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.
-You hire a lawyer.
-That's how I want to finish.
"-What, with a lawsuit?"
-No.
With that song.
-Which song?
-The song I just played you.
-It's a ballad.
-So what?
-You want me to hand them a ballad?
-That's right.
- What took you so long?
- I needed a cigarette.
"Got a problem with that, little miss?"
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.
"- Oh, do you have any weed?"
"- No, can I have my mail?"
"- Hello, baby."
- Would you like to take Evie?
- Certainly not.
I can't afford to smell of vomit.
"- Yeah, I know, I remember."
- Maybe one of the other girls can take care of her.
- Is M free at the moment?
- Thank you.
- Um.
What did you do that for?
"- 'Cause it's not the first time a client's written me a love letter, Lily."
- Really?
Like what?
What kind of stuff do they write?
"Well, like what?"
"Roses are red, violets are blue,"
I pay you money and we fuck.
"- Yeah, pretty much."
"- Now then, Joey is it?"
- Yeah.
Katy.
Katy.
- I'm an employment officer here at the Elizabeth branch.
Do you know why Centrelink has called you in today?
- 'Cause it's my birthday?
"Yes, we are bending all together"
Nice
Bend a little more
"Nice, very nice"
Bend
Why is not this one working?
What kind of neck is that my girl?
You raise it like a duck
"Bend, Will you stand like this infront of Valide Sultana?"
"Bend, bend a little more."
Bend!
Nice
Is not Sümbül Ağa here?
I don't know where he is my Sultana
He's always missing
"Gül Ağa, I'll have 2 fountains built"
Find needing neighbourhoods for me
Find the locations.
Oh and I'll also have a Turkish bath built
Mşallah my Sultana.
You'll get lots of prayings
He'd tell about this to his Sultana
It would be good.
That's why I said it in public
"If not him, then someone else will dliver this message"
What are these?
Sculptures.
But what are they doing here?
Welcome
These are...
"Diana, Apollo and Hercules"
İbrahim Paşa brought them from Buda
Let me go!
You swine!
I'll give it to you right in the face!
Bastard!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
He wouldn't obey either!
So I grabbed him just like this and pushed him out of the car!
Murderer!
Help!
Help!
We wander through the whole wide world
We wander because we enjoy it so
We wander over hill and dale
We wander through the whole wide world
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Where's Mieze?
I heard her yelling.
She's not yelling anymore.
Let's go!
NO SHORT SWIM TRUNKS ALLOWED
Mieze's run away.
What can I do?
She left her clothes and everything behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Yeah.
What's she doing with a louse like me?
It was just the one time.
One time or ten ― it's the same thing.
I know who she ran off with.
- Who?
- A guy she knew before.
Do you still have the photographs?
"Yeah, I have everything inside."
"Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?"
Copy that.
"Be right back, billy."
What are you hoping to find?
We're trying to clear a good man's name.
¶ ¶
"These are, uh, these are all from the enright crime scene."
"Okay, let's scan those."
All right.
Let me invert the images.
"All right, there's jesse, there's the house,"
"The front gate, more house."
"What else we got, eric?"
wait a minute.
"Eric, go back."
Go back.
What is he doing?
"Evidence marker number four, eric."
"Number four, that's the cuff link."
That's the missing evidence.
Right.
Who is this?
I don't know.
It isn't cardoza.
It's not jesse.
Who is that?
Let me clean up the flare on his face.
Hitting the highlights.
Clean up some of this mess.
Captain sutter.
- talking about?
"- Your date, Audrey?"
She got a visit from your wife.
Grace cancelled her.
Grace did?
You had no idea?
Do you know how this impacts my business?
Audrey Richardson?
She's one of my most important clients.
"Well, if Grace thought it was a bad idea, then I'm fine with that."
I'll find Audrey someone else.
Rein in your wife.
"I don't put my wife in her ""place."""
This isn't the '50s.
Remember what's at stake here.
"Look around, Adriana."
We are shut down.
The SEC is up our ass.
I am well aware of what's at stake.
Wait.
This is it.
Here.
The location.
It's perfect.
Your office?
Not my office.
A 1950s office.
"A throwback to old traditions, gender roles, where a man could ""rein in his wife."""
With all the sexual role-play that implies.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
"That was inspired, Neil."
But also continuously.
Martin?
-I'd like to say something.
-Yes.
"If it goes on like this, it will come to an end."
-Yes.
-I mean yesterday.
Yes.
Why did you let that idiot be with you?
We could have had a nice evening.
-Yes.
-Who are you constantly calling?
-Are you even listening to me?
-No.
I mean yes.
You get this from the pills.
Trying it on yourself!
What do you have your guinea-pigs for?
Some things in human homes are breakable.
And some are unbreakable.
What do people use it for?
"I don't know, people are strange."
And hang up when I'm speaking with you!
"No, I can't stand it."
When will this misery end?
!
Some things can open normally.
And some can't open at all.
But they can.
We must close the opening so that something else won't fly away.
-Some things play.
-And some things don't play.
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
"Good morning, doctor."
"Hello, Commissioner."
She died.
Just a few hours ago.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes..."
She was murdered?
Difficult to say.
The pulse is very weak.
"Janitor, a glass of water, please."
"Go, drink."
He probably absorbed a violent narcotic.
He'll be back.
Go away!
What do you want?
I am a physician.
Ease your mind.
Breathe quietly.
Deeply.
Tell us what happened to you.
My head hurts.
What happened to me?
"I do not know, I do not know."
"Ah, yes!"
"Yes, yes!"
"I was reading, last night and suddenly, some people came out of hiding and pounced on me."
"I wanted to free myself, but I was gagged, and they pierced my arm with something sharp."
I lost consciousness.
"I wanted to scream, move, but I was powerless."
I sank.
"But who are you, sir?"
The Commissioner eighteenth borough.
"When you were attacked, you were alone?"
Better come with me.
Did everything go alright?
Not now.
"Hi, Kelly."
"My regular, Willy."
Right.
"Two more beers, Willy."
Yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
I got one.
"Hi, buddy, what'll you have?"
"This is for hers, and I'll have a cognac."
Thanks.
You just get off the boat?
"Yes, how did you know?"
It shows all over.
Where are you from?
France.
Hm... where did you learn to speak English so good?
I studied at a great school in Oxford.
Oxford...
I oughta go there.
They'd be more likely to study you there.
Are you being insulting?
"No, I just meant that you'd make a fascinating course in anatomy."
Thanks.
How come you just get off the boat and head straight for a bar?
Looking for company.
"Hm, what sort of company?"
Your sort.
How do you know what my sort is?
"Well, you're not a school teacher."
"Hey, man."
Yeah?
So Caroline tells me you've been on your own the past two weeks.
Is everything okay?
You're asking me about my mom?
Seriously?
Why don't I have her give you a call when she blows through?
Dude.
"That's not what I meant, okay?"
I'm just trying to...
- I don't know what to say.
- Good.
"Don't say anything, because you're a dick, end of story."
I know.
"Yeah, whatever."
BONNIE:
"Hey, thanks for meeting me."
- I wanted you to see this.
- Is that Emily's spell book?
I've been going through it since Grams died.
Check this out.
- That's the vampire compass.
- Yeah.
"According to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never succeeded in inventing anything."
Emily secretly spelled them all with magic.
Compass.
Rings.
The mystery device you told me about.
ELENA:
"Yeah, that's it."
"Well, part of it."
Damon only has the one piece.
Go.
Go.
- Come on!
Pick it up!
- Stop!
"I'm calling the cops, kid!"
"- Let's grab the bike, man."
"- Look, you can't tell anyone."
Okay?
No one.
It's okay.
I swear.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Hey.
"You did good, all right?"
"All right, stop crying and go to sleep."
- Jacob...
What if we really went to Galveston like Mom wanted?
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Would you like to try our new Quiet Burger?
"- No, thanks, Ted."
I'll just have an order of Crazy Fries.
"- Hey, you want ham or peanut butter?"
- Ham.
- Watch out.
There's enough rat poison in this dipped cone to kill a neo...
- Uh...
"I was thinking once she's dead, we could put her body in the... you know, just like on that one episode of..."
- I want some.
- You asked for ham.
- God!
Now we'll never know which episode it'll be like!
"- Yes, but..."
As soon as we arrive...
The Prime Minister will never accept her
First hear him ask him.
"Yes, but the Prime Minister..."
I hear things... \ It's strange.
This experience is like...
Like a gift.
"Here, among the people."
"I understand, sire."
"They're so welcoming and open, and..."
Here people do not have much.
Here people do not have much.
But I'm still...
That must be the Serbian border.
Let me do this this time.
Sire?
"You will not want the protocol to waste time, right?"
"No protocol, Ludovic."
"Carlos, take the camera."
Hello.
"- Passports, please."
Good morning.
Do the Serbian phones work?
- No phones.
How come the welcome concert?
- It is the Serbia In Ball dance campaign.
The state wants us to give a positive image of Serbia to foreigners.
Go for a walk.
You have a familiar look.
It looks like Miss Serbia 2005.
"2006, for precision."
Who are you?
You jest.
You jape.
I am one of Britain's top comic talents.
"- Say something funny, then."
- Yeah.
"If you're so funny, why don't you say something funny?"
"Go on, say something funny."
"All right, then, I will, I will."
Erm...
Plop.
"- Oh, dear."
- Damn.
Mistimed it.
I'll have to get the manager.
Mr Forsyth!
"Listen, bitch, I was once continuity link man on TVS."
I don't see why I should have to pay for my food.
"Listen, dickhead-no money, no food."
Ah.
Ooh.
You're the sort of girl I could fall in love with.
"However, no time, because Richie?"
- Yes?
- Run!
- I meant through the door.
"- Oh, sorry."
I thought they'd never give up.
Mr Forsyth had some stamina.
Safe and sound now and time to get on with my wonderful dinner party.
That's what you think.
But I have been thinking.
- He is no criminal!
"- So, he's starting to act like that again?"
"Not him, me!"
You darling?
Ah well.
Kiss me!
Kiss!
What a fine girl you are.
Just how I like it.
He's hanging around with scum like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself!"
- Let me go!
I can't breathe!
"- Feel free, there is plenty of air!"
You think you can just run away and ashame me in front of my friends later tonight?
"Reinhold said Kiss me, follow my order!"
Let me go!
I'll take anything I can find and throw it in your face!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
"He behaved just like you, unwilling to comply with my rules!"
So I grabbed him like this and threw him outta the car!
Killer!
Killer!
Killer!
Help!
- Go!
- What happened to you?
Where is Mieze?
Why was she screaming?
She isn't screaming anymore.
Now go!

He's with the Vice Commander.
He can't get away right now.

"Faiz, what happened?"
Be seated!
This is my very dear brother.
I love him very much.
I had sent him there for studies.
"What kind of studies is he doing that, he has become like this?"
"Brother, there is someone whom Faiz loves."
- She does not care for him?
- No!
"I mean, she did care earlier."
- But not now.
What say?
"- Yes, brother."
The thing is... he is right!
So my brother is spoiling his life being a romantic.

"She didn't care about you, isn't it?"
"Here, take off your trunks."
Hold this.
Okay.
And then put on these jogging shorts.

- I don't suppose anyone here knows the origin of the marathon.
The Greeks met the Persians in battle...
Sit down.
On a great plain called Marathon.
The Greeks were victorious and sent a runner back to the city with the glorious news.
The distance was that of the modern marathon.
"- Rick, what are you doing?"
"- We need another sock, Coach."
One more sock.
Lacing up shoes.
The young man ran at top speed...
"Shoes, please."

I'm dry!

What do you think of them?
I think they're horrible.
"At least I got 'em, mate."
Cos I fucking wear 'em.
Right...
How about you?
Do you... have any marks?
- No.
I'm fine.
"- Oh, yeah, course you are..."
You're fine and dandy.
Right?
Egg and cress...
It's a little fucking miracle.

Why are you so uninterested?

Football?
I'm not going to let you die.
"22nd August, 2007."
You have two new messages.
First message.
"Neil, Ranbir here."
Call me back.
Second message.
Neil... it's been three months now.
You keep saying that you'll come here.
I guess it was naive of me to believe you.
Anyway...
I just want you to know that...
I'm pregnant.
"I'm sure, this is the last thing you needed to know."
"Neil, I've treasured every moment of my life since I met you."
"And, I'll always love you for that."

You broke your ankle.
"Dr. Mead, um, the doctor, he thinks you need much rest."

[Kisses]
[Speaking Polish]
But you don't think he's German?
"- Oh, no."
- Just as well.
"[Mouth full, indecipherable]"
"- Oh, Ursula."
Please.
Sorry.
He seems to understand the language.
"- Oh, really?"
Since when did you speak German?
"Well, I..."
How is he?
"If he drinks any more tea, he's gonna need a chamber pot 'cause he ain't fit to walk to the bathroom."
You finished with this lot?
"Yes, I think so."
What's he gonna do without his clothes?
His own are ruined.
I thought perhaps some of father's might fit him.
"I doubt it, but you could try."
You want me to get the chest then?
"If you wouldn't mind, Dorcas."
It's Peter.
Right?
Yeah.
"And, Jeanine, can I just say that it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person?"
FOUR:
"Congratulations, Mother."
You got your war.
I know you wish there was another way.
But there isn't.
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?
You'd better be.
JEANNE'.
"Tell me, why did you surrender to Erudite?"
What do you want?
I would like a position in your regime.
"Ideally, I would like a position with some advancement opportunities."
(LAUGHS)
"I may be Dauntless, but I'm not just a meathead."
"No offense, Max."
(SCOFFS)
Prove your worth to us.
Then we can discuss your ambitions.
Great.
When do I start?
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.
How do I flush her out?
"PETER""."
Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.
Where's your friend?
-Ariving.
Your cop friends?
Around are.
Are they here?
Just me now.
You and that fucking gun who do not know how to use it.
What happened Luu?
Dead.
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
"This is a big problem for your friend, you know that?"
I do not think so.
Do not you know?
What the fuck do you want?
You and that stupid gun.
I saw how much you're handy with miracle.
-Sit down.
Have a seat.
Sit down or I'll kill you.
"Listen, man."
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like Andes?
He kills people.
You kill people.
"Deserve it, your wife and child."
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident.
-Accident?
People have to come to me with a certain respect.
Some things can not tolerate.
"When someone accuses me of something,"
I take that as an insult.
Move!
Go!
Go!
- Najim!
"No, wait He's coming."
He's coming.
Stop the car.
- Quickly.
- Come on...
Come on...
Good boy.
Well done.

That's not my usual fantasy.

"I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humour, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or are you still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
You knew that.
And you fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine yards to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott, you know."
But unfortunately I can only rescue you at the moment.
Lucky me.
Bitch.
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
Daddy.
Go crazy.
And here's a tiny little schnitzel and I'll take a tiny little bite...
"No, don't eat mine!"
I'm late for rehearsal.
"Go on, go to your rehearsal and don't do us any favors."
I know your assistant director can do the replacement.
"Sure, why not?"
Why don't we let Slava Chaplin do it?
Silkis.
Silkis.
Hello.
Are you Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant.
"Yitzhak, what's going on?"
We have a search warrant.
What are you searching for?
"Goni, go to your room."
Why?
Come in.
Check the bookshelf.
Take a look in the bedroom.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
Don't you think you're out of line?
What do you think you'll find here?
"Tell them to stop, Yitzhak."
You and your damn police have some nerve!
Ora.
There's nothing we can do.
Let them finish.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- How many years?
One?
Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Partners back each other up.
You have no business telling me how partners should treat each other.
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?
"I hate to tell you this, but you're not a homicide detective any more."
"- 9221, this is base."
Come in.
- Hardy.
We've got another 111.
Northshore.
East of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Now!
"If the kids have any bad dreams, call this number."
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.
"Kids, come on."
Let's go home.
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?
- The body was dumped last night.
"Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you."
You made me nervous.
"You look like shit, acting all crazy."
What's up with you?
Nothing is up with me.
"It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you."
"You ain't hearing me, man."
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
"Howdy, partner."
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.
- What about?
"- I don't know, but it seemed important."
"Well, he's gonna have to wait."
It's Miller time.
We need to talk.
Follow me.
Come on!
Another Bourbon.
Make it double.
You shooting coke or something?
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.
How about abnormally?
I see Reynolds is back to work.
Gets to make bail.
Who visits him?
Nobody.
He is all alone.
"Earlier his daughter would write to him, every week."
- That doesn't happen anymore.
- Why not?
"She died, poor thing."
"It was a car accident, January 2006."
Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone.
"Poor man, all broken down."
I understand.
What was his daughter's name?
Natasha.
Natasha Malhotra.
Can I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports?
Why not.
But it could take some time.
"I'll have to go through some of the old files, you see."
Sure.
I will have someone call you later.
Is that okay?
- No problem.
- Thank you.
"We're done, let's go."
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
One thing is certain.
The murder wasn't committed by Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
Right.
But he was the reason for it.
Being cryptic suits you... not this case.
Okay.
Hello!
Help!
Help me!
So you've been looking for the daughter of Milonkovic?
Why?
We think it would be in the car.
We began the search yesterday.
Daughter reported missing in Sweden.
She lives with her mother in Gothenburg.
Did you know about the person in the trunk?
-Yup.
-What Was the fucking game then?
Why did not you tell us?
Hello?
-I Can not say.
All right.
Let's forget whims and pride and work.
You then have the theory that she was in the trunk?
-Is It possible.
-And She was saved by someone that killed the other?
-Deixamos All options open.
"-Legal, Sikkeland."
Mutual-confidence now?
"-surely, On my part."
Where is she from?
Stay there!
-Fatalidades Or injury?
-Still Are there.
-Milonkovic Was there?
I do not know.
The explosive was in the back.
I suppose you have a good view of it and the league-Z?
-Alice has returned to Underland.
-Where is she now?
-In Salazen Grum.
Forgive me.
I allowed her to divert from her destined path.
"No, no, no, no."
But that is exactly where she will find the Vorpal sword.
We have our champion.
Rest now.
You've done well.
(SQUEAKING)
ALICE:
Have you seen a hat around here?
"You must find Alice, Stayne."
"Without the Jabberwocky, my sister's followers will surely rise against me."
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyone fall in love with her.
"Men, women,"
(ANIMALS GRUNTING) even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
"Majesty, is it not better to be feared than loved?"
Not certain anymore.
"Oh, let her have the rabble."
I don't need them.
He was stabbed many times?
Not just once?
"Hey, where is everyone?"
We got some new information.
We're all going to Im Tae Ho's house.
What?
Oh...
Put him in handcuffs immediately!
Everybody is going crazy...
Starting with President Seo.
"Hey, take those off."
"Wait, what's going on?"
Why do you need to see our car?
Please cooperate.
Please... open the door for us.
We need to do this to prove Tae Ho's innocence.
Why are you trying to prove the innocence of a person who did nothing wrong?
Three million won per week...
But Mr. President...
Where did you get this new information?
It was from an anonymous source.
Anonymous!
"- Hurry up, get in there."
Hurry.
- Yes.
Honey.
Are you okay?
Did you get any sleep?
Yes.
Once this is over...
I will get my revenge on President Seo for this.
Yoon Sang Min and Park Seon Woo... and... anyone else that is involved.
There was little p.çleri. Now the dead.
I killed them.
A few friend like that.
"Around out there, the drugs sold."
All the dirt was making them.
I was doing the right thing.
I was going great.
Cleaned the streets.
Was wrong.
No one did not work.
Drugs flowed somehow.
The bad one always remained poor.
"Everything is about money, son."
Now I'm happy to be on this side.
The money side.
So do you.
- Okay?
"I'm doing it for you, you know?"
- I understand.
I understand.
- I am very grateful for everything you did for me.
- I love you.
You are my son.
Hallederken this job if you need me call me.
I call.
But you will not need to.
"However, take care."
To fix this problem.
"- If you are going across borders and customs control of the If I had transportation, it would be OAN'de."
- Oan?
- Public Transport.
"- Tool, the other should have been hired."
"It's enough to make you scream, you know!"
People are supposed to sit here all night waiting for tickets!
Is it war or what?
"No coming, no going."
And no one to complain to.
No one to tell about it.
Such huge trains are running and they can't take just one person on.
What kind of business is that?
Parasites!
"- Hey, man, what's that you got?"
- A ticket.
- For the next train?
"- Right, it's coming."
- She said no tickets.
- This is WL.
It's expensive.
How expensive?
"Well, it's not that expensive, but it's good because..."
Oh shit!
"Make way, women!"
Can you hear me?
"Aunt Katya, take a broom and come to the buffet."
"Folks, who ties animals to the ticket office?"
"Someone tied a dog, now it's a steer."
It's no way.
"Untie him, please."
Hello.
Good day.
- Hi.
- It's occupied.
Oh God...
- I'll be right back.
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Lord
Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
You see?
Okay bring the pry bars in.
Push!
Get them in there!
Get them under.
"Good, good."
That's it.
Watch your clothes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
Weahh!
Sorry Indy.
"Indy, why does the floor move?"
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction."
So please eat something.
I must apologize for the treatment of you.
Yeah?
Who's idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
This particular time and place and for my work they are necessary evils.
Not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world we are not entirely uncivilized."
Beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
Ha!
I bet you would.
"Stop, I say!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Cancel those shipments of wine, grain, straw!"
Cancel everything!
"- Dennis, here she is."
Griselda!
- Here I am.
It's me!
"Dennis, it was always you!"
You's the one we was pushing for.
We'll have the wedding tomorrow.
This afternoon.
We'll get the bishop.
"Dennis, you're wonderful."
"Griselda, at last we can have the life we always wanted."
"My boy, congratulations."
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.
You have cleared the kingdom of a great menace.
I am happy to fulfill my promise and to bestow upon you...
- What's his name?
- It's Dennis.
"Dennis Cooper, Your Royalshipness."
"That's his fiancée, my daughter."
"You, Dennis one half of my entire kingdom."
"And the hand in marriage of my daughter, the princess."
"Come, my boy."
To the palace!
Griselda!
I pronounce you man and wife.
Prince and princess!
Dennis!
Griselda!
"He had never deceived me, but for that night."
I always lost sleep and waited anxiously for his return.
"The time passed, one, two. three."
One gets preoccupied and concerned with... the thought that something might have happened.
"Telemessage, the person you called is unavailable."
FiIippo?
Is it you?
Also drunk again.
You are unable to even vomit.
Come back to say you lost all your money?
I lost everything.
Who won now?
The dull.
The blonde.
"I said to you, no more games."
"So I played once again, so what?"
Alright.
It is not the most important thing in the world.
And how much did you lose?
All of it.
I've lost totally.
Totally!
All of it.
All.
I have nothing left.
You have your wife.
"She is a beautiful woman, your wife."
-Only for one night.
"-Or pay the ten million, which you owe."
-Your wife is a precious woman.
-And very lucky.
Yes.
- Yeah.
- Jacob.
I heard you were leaving.
- Can you give me one last blessing?
- Sure.
May the force be with you.
That... that's it?
"Yeah, I'm afraid so."
"For more details, see your local priest or rabbi."
Take care.
"- So, you all good?"
"- Yeah, I'm good."
"- Good, good..."
- More or less.
"Just, um..."
"I mean, you know, crazy as it sounds, I-I miss God."
"Well, if it's of any comfort,"
I'm sure God would be thrilled at your recovery.
Really?
How do you figure?
'Cause you serve God's neediest people by making tons of money and giving it away.
- God loves charity.
- All right.
"If you wandered the world with a begging bowl, who would that help?"
- Absolutely no one.
- Nobody.
"In fact, it'd be a sin."
"So go forth, continue to do God's work."
- All right.
Golf next week.
- Done.
"So, uh, is there anybody home?"
"Well, I'll get some kind of a job and start up the old road again."
"(male #2) 'What's the assessment, my good fellow?"
'
"(male #3) One forty, sir."
"Here you are, there's five dollars."
You keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
And buy yourself a haircut with it.
"Ah, there you are, children."
"Father, where were you?"
I've been worried to death.
"Serving our noble cause, my dear."
"Here, just feast your eyes on that."
Fifteen thousand!
"Well, who's Magenta P. Schultz?"
"- Why, that..."
"- Father, how did you get it?"
When I told the Duchess the predicament we were in she insisted on helping us out.
- Insisted?
"- Yes, my dear."
Insisted.
"Ah, there's a woman for you."
Isn't it splendid?
"Come, come, my boy."
Reassemble the cast.
"Order the costumes, strike up the band."
The show will go on.
[laughing] [mumbling] Abracadabra.
Abra..
Abracadabra!
Abracadabra!
Here's your money.
"Are you sure you're okay, dude?"
"No, I'm not."
"I start thinking, you know, and it makes..."
It makes me so angry.
What am I saying?
Okay.
Were gonna go...
We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
- Yes!
- And you stay here and eat your eggs.
Have the...
Have...
Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
"- Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?"
- Can you meet us later?
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?
- Are you gonna meet us?
"- Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!"
All right.
"All right, sign here, here and here."
And what is this?
These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.
"Oh, we don't care about that."
Sign away.
"- What's the, uh, fighter's name?"
- Clown Baby.
- Clown Ba...
Clown Baby?
- Yeah.
- You mean like a baby clown?
- Not a baby clown.
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, Yo-Yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
This bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
The rear window.
That minibus is following us.
I command you to place obstacles in its path.
City property.
I've damaged city property.
They said these glasses were shatterproof.
Was that a bus or a bridge?
They're still with us.
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Man, that man was really buzzing."
Am I still alive?
They're gaining on us.
She counteracts everything that Tony does.
"Tony, you've got to stop her."
We flew!
They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.
Sickle...
"Sickle, stop..."
Stop over that hill.
"Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window to magnify and shine so brightly that our pursuers'll be blinded by it."
"Come on, open the doors."
I can't see.
- Yeah.
"- Come on, let me out."
- Everybody OK?
"- Yeah, sure."

Bye-bye!
"Damn, Hiroshima escaped!"
Bye-bye!
I'll go to Japan to stop him!
"No need, it's only a small matter."
Small matter?
You traitor!
- What?
- l beat you.
Why did you hit me?
Why not!
The whole world's destroyed by you.
You're the sinner of all mankind.
- l'm sorry!
- Why hit her?
And me too?
Why did you give the Formula to the Japanese?
What are you laughing at?
"Don't worry, Hiroshima never got the real 'Beast'!"
Then where's the real one?
The real one's right here!
"Well done, Yoyo!"
I can see the money already.
We can go on a trip tomorrow!
Shush...someone's about!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Come out quickly!
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
About everyone screwing everyone.
What you read in the tabloids.
It's even worse.
- l could tell you stories.
- Tell me.
There's one bigwig when he throws a party the neighbors secure their kids behind locks this big.
Kids six or seven years of age.
"Girls, but boys too."
What do you think of that little boys?
- Hello sir.
"Hi, Herman."
- Adrienne...
Madam told me to clean up.
Won't you join us?
Funny bunny.
"Tell me more, Gerard."
Later in the car.
- Coming?
- Good morning.
- What the hell are you doing?
- For later!
You with a famous writer!
Who cares...
Bye!
"Now tell me, do these TV people go at it all the time?"
They slow down in their 80's.
Can't we flnd a quiet place in the dunes?
I'm a nature lover.
"Ah, I like touring."
"And are those showgirls an easy lay, too?"
"- You revel in such things, don't you?"
- l love sex.
Hallo!
Hallo!
It's trash.
Oh look!
It's working.
"Look, isn't it manually propelled?"
Mine also works.
Perfectly!
Try it with this.
-It's splendid!
-It's something.
It's really something.
"You have two days off, go to the forest and pull yourself together."
"Yes, nature is beautiful."
"Sometimes I jack it in and go to a forest somewhere, to nature's bosom."
"A forest, what can be more beautiful?"
"The clearing, stumps... deer, foxes, otters, seals, giraffes..."
Walruses...
Ah...
I can't remember the last time I was there.
"A propos of the report, do you have it for me?"
"No, I..."
Quiet.
Be quiet.
Be quiet.
We're only human.
"Accompany the doctor, please."
"Comrade director, a delegation is waiting for you."
Are the scissors prepared?
It's beautiful!
"Isn't it beautiful, when all the houses are the same?"
There's such an order in it.
Just say what you want.
You have to speak up.
How else can I understand you?
Why are you so distant suddenly?
I just want to freshen up my head a bit.
"Oh, that's it."
"Well, sir, you should do what you prefer."
"When things become clear to me, I'll call you."
It will become clear for sure.
I'll talk to you then.
"I'll express myself not with words, but with action and time."
What's the date today?
Ah!
You're here!
Have some coffee.
It's better than I'd expected.
Have some potatoes.
"Coffee, no thanks."
"Ah, yes."
I'll have some coke.
"- Okay, do you have change?"
"- Yeah, I've got some."
- Changwook!
- Be careful.
"- Shall we go, Director Kim?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
- Lovely.
What's gotten into you?
Two days later
"Help me, please."
The phone has been turned off.
"Dr. Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you.
Die!
She took a blow to the head when it hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard
- That's an order.
Tile?
What happened?
Where's colonel Sheppard?
He went after the creature.
You let him go alone?
"Well, he wanted me to stay with you."
I am fine.
Go.
Aren't we supposed to follow his orders?
Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
Who decides when it's one of those times?
We do.
That's good enough.
Ellia... don't make me do this.
You okay?
Yeah.
She tried feeding on me.
She wasn't going to let us take her back.
Yeah.
I know.
Stargate Atlantis -=the end=-
What a great vacation getaway in the Pegasus galaxy.
Where is everyone?
"There is smoke from the chimneys, they're inside."
Will you turn that off?
This is a library.
What a fucking chode.
- What the fuck?
!
"- Oh, my God."
"You know, the whole reason people come to the stacks... is for some peace and... quiet."
"Look, I know, I'm sorry."
I hate it when people disturb me here too.
It's just this fucking calculus final is killing me.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.
- You're actually very close.
May I?
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I touched your breast.
- It's OK.
- Sorry.
You just go--
Wow.
You're good at this.
Thanks.
"What did you, like, take calculus in high school or something?"
"Actually, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade."
"What, are you like Doogie Howser?"
No.
Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.
I love that show.
What are you working on there?
This is just a poem for my creative writing class.
Please.
Your turn.
- Tired?
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure.
I have some old movies.
"It Happened One Night, Lawrence of Arabia, Now, Voyager?"
How about Lawrence of Arabia?
It's nice and long.
Okay.
Lawrence of Arabia it is.
Just stick it in.
Right.
- Is it over?
- Yeah.
Go to sleep.
Are you just looking or buying?
- I'm not sure yet.
"- So, it seems to be going well."
- Have you?
"- No, and it's made no difference."
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?
I was just telling Henry how sex isn't an issue for us.
"It's much less complicated this way, not to mention sanitary."
It feels so good to be writing again.
I have so many ideas for the new book!
It's coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.
"- It really makes you, like, squirm."
So good.
"- Oh, my God."
- I love Kevin Corrigan.
"Okay, Englewood."
Okay.
"Well, the last bus to Englewood left seven minutes ago."
You see?
She's fine.
Let's go.
"No, just because there was a last bus doesn't mean she was on the last bus."
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.
"- Oh, no."
Don't throw up.
"- Oh, God."
The thing that's too bad is that there were many other throw up scenes in the original and now there's...
"No, I mean, that's a good thing."
- I don't...
"- Remember, there were like...?"
- We shot four other throw-up scenes.
- On the bus.
Remember?
"With the projectile, with the tube hooked up to your face."
Yeah.
- Norah.
- Caro...
"Oh, no."
"This was like a river, a river flowing."
"Oh, God."
And it's so hard to sync it up with your mouth.
- It seemed all so unreal.
- Empty your pockets.
"- Hey, meth-head."
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.
"Do it, or I will kill you both."
"Okay, here you go."
Look.
Empty.
- Now you.
- I don't have anything.
- Do it.
- I don't have...
- Just empty your pockets.
- No.
I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna...
I don't feel like standing in this alley all night.
- It's a matter of principle.
- A matter of principle?
- I don't feel like standing in an alley with a meth-head.
"- I'm gonna stab you, man!"
"- For the love of God, empty your pockets."
- Okay.
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.
You give us a second.
Where did you get that money?
I had to change the bet... a little.
- You bet against me?
- I bet against you.
- Why would you bet against me?
- It was the right move.
- But you fuck like one.
- Chill.
- Did you hear what he said?
Jonas has got a 5 million dollar trust fund.
- Money's not everything.
- It is tonight.
Tommy?
...
Tommy?
- I made a couple of bad investments.
- So we've no more money?
- I took some chances.
- What about this summer?
- I sold the beach house.
- We just asked our friends to come.
- Cancel them.
- We'll be a joke.
The bank wants its money.
Nobody will lend me any.
- Come on.
- We'll never forgive you for this.
- I need your credit cards.
- What will we live on?
You'll have to stop shopping.
He's so way out of line.
I'll call five to tell them granny's fallen ill; you take the rest.

She didn't even have to shag him.
And he died right away.
Wouldn't that make him my brother-in-law?

Stupid.
Stupid?

'Sister-in-law'...
Did you just insult me?
"Choong Sik, Choong Sik..."
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Stay out of it!
Sister-in-law...
Sister-in-law!
Stupid!
Don't get involved.
Don't get involved and go home.
But Yoon Jae...!
He's being careless with you!
"Brother-in-law is right, you stupid."
"And if you get involved, it'll make things more complicated."
So just hurry up and go home.
Just listen to me and go home.
"When you get thirsty, drink water instead of the carbonated drinks."
Ah!
That burns!
"For the time being, since there's mom inheritance... they won't throw you away."

"Good, good."
Eat more if you like it.

What will we do ?
I don't want that happened either!
"In such situation,"
I could not stop the bike!

I'm in a meeting.

- What meeting?
- Hello...
- The signal is low!
I'll hang up.
- Yawang.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
Bye.
What are you trying to do?
Mind your own business.
How long do you intend to stay here?
Don't try to change the subject.
"Captain, please play another round with me."
Just concentrate on practising for the upcoming competition.
I wish to start immediately.
I'm about to leave.
What are you talking about?
I don't have much time already.
What do you mean?
We'll talk about it later.
"Hurry up, go for practice."
Tezuka.
Tezuka.
"For next week's Kanto Meet, the playing members have already been selected."
The first team we're up against is Hyotei Gakuen.
Heh...
Hyotei...
"No way, it'll definitely be a blood bath."
"- We lost last year but this year, we'll definitely win!"
- Yeah!
These are the Kanto's meet regulars' uniforms.
- Tezuka's choices are Oishi Shuichiro.
- Yes.
- Fuji Shusuke.
- Yes.
- Kikumaru Eiji.
- Yes.
- Kawamura Takashi.
- Yes.
"I'm in a hurry, Pierre."
What do you want to know?
"Where have the 40,000 euros come from?"
What are you insinuating?
"I don't know. 40,000 euros were deposited in this account, the firm's account, and they disappeared."
I'm wondering.
This money was sealed.
My client needed to get it back in cash.
I helped him.
That's all.
Why make it go through the firm's account?
You couldn't deposit it in his account directly?
He doesn't have an account.
His banking privilege is suspended.
You don't believe me?
Call him.
"Go ahead, call him!"
You wouldn't take the risk of lying to me.
"I give you my word, all right?"
Arnaud Ledoré?
Hello.
How are you?
Hello.
- Do you remember me?
Do you know Mr Delcourt?
Can we talk to you for two minutes?
Yes.
What about?
It's about Julie.
Julie.
That's enough.
- Who filmed that?
Heck no!
"Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions."
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Boss, she's a woman in a million."
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She don't talk.
Oh!
"All right, get on with the dogs."
"No, thank you."
I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say!
"Nice, modest little prices they have here."
They practically give things away.
"Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?"
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do.
Come on.
"- Come on, Buck."
"- Come on, Buck."
"Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye."
There's an officer of the Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
"We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds."
"Yeah, yeah."
"No disturbance, that's an order."
Yan-ling!
Jun-kit!
What happened?
Fung-wu!
Stop!
What's this all about?
They won't let Yan-ling see you.
You must have provoked them!
No!
He said there can be no disturbing the chess game.
Is it true?
It's the Highness's order.
No disturbance from anybody.
Please go to Mr. Chao!
And you two better leave.
You better go back!
Fung-wu!
"Go back, don't cause any trouble!"
Let's go!
I feel something odd will happen tonight.
Now why is chess so mysterious?
It's a game.
You go on ahead.
I'll keep watch here.
Make sure you don't fight!
I won't!
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
I want to acquire the mystery of Shaolin kung-fu.
I'm a sincere Buddhist.
What's wrong with accepting me?
Please calm down!
What?
What's real is the cop we have tied up in the basement.
"When Marius calls, we can let him go."
The cop does not care about us.
- I swear to God...
- How do you know that?
It seems to me... we let him go.
"Best case... prison, my business destroyed, and Family Services takes Amanda."
- No.
- I won't let that happen.
[phone buzzes]
"[buzzing] [door closes, lock latches]"
- Hey.
"- Hey, Pete."
I'm just going out.
Where to?
"I was gonna go, uh, go see my friend..."
"- you know, the married one."
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I thought..."
I thought maybe... you were going out to slash another one of my tires.
Huh?
The liquor store across the street... they have a security camera.
I saw you.
Why?
- [gulp]
"- Fucking why, huh?"
Why?
"Don't you fucking say that it was about this trunk thing because I already apologized to you for that, okay?"
[breathing heavily]
Porta-Potty.
What?
"-Listen, I'm sorry I hung you with that."
"-No, forget about it."
"Actually, this one witness, Fuentes..."
"... webothfeltthathehadmoreto say,  you know..."
... likehewasembarrassed in front of his wife.
-Martinez is calling him up.
KELLY:
Wait a minute.
Fuentes. I interviewed the guy.
He seemed okay.
-Yeah?
It's probably nothing.
"-Well, let me know, okay?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Mr. Fuentes, it's Detective Martinez."
My partner and I got the impression maybe something was bothering you...
... maybeyoufeltuncomfortable talking about it.
"We thought you might want to come in and talk, like, private, man-to-man."
"Okay, good."
"You work nights, right?"
"Well, how about tomorrow morning?"
Great.
"All right, just ask for Detective Martinez or Medavoy."
Beautiful.
He's coming in.
You think Roberts offed her?
He's an asshole.
We know that.
Whether he committed a murder?
We'll get the toxicology.
We'll find out.
Big night?
Philip.
I hope that wasn't too bad.
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.
"Oh, hey."
How's it going?
Mmh... good.
We met before.
Er...
I don't think we have.
You sure about that?
Um...
I wanted to tell you I really liked your book.
"Those advance copies really get around, huh?"
"Anyway, the first one's better."
"Um, I haven't read it."
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.
"No, if you were a groupie, you likely would have read both my books."
Are there book groupies?

"Readings, interviews."
Nothing.

"- Oh, quite."
"That's a horrible, horrible idea."
I don't like the idea of being on display.
My mind is made up.

And you hate Toronto Would.
"- This is officially a mess, and I will brush."
Now we have a plane to catch.
- I say kidnapped a girl.
- I missed my house.
They knew how to be there?
.
- I can not trust anyone.
- You can trust me.
- Is this correct?
"Mike gave your name, Father."
I knew how good?
- She did not know.
- I listened to confession?
"Even if you listened, you paylaşamazdım, you know."
"- I have no time to play the game, Father."
"- Admission of never listen, but there was a burden on seemed."
- I never said anything about the people we do business?
- No.
- What?
- What is it?
"- All right, let's get goin'."
"- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob..."
I got to ask you a question before this all goes down.
- All the guards in Guantánamo are gay?
"- Fuck, no!"
Ain't nothing gay about getting your dick sucked!
You're the ones that's gay for sucking' my dick!
- What?
- In fact... creeps me out just bein' around you fags.

"God, his dick smells like shit, dude."
Holy shit!
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!
- Come on.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!"
Should we?
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
You accuse me of stealing them!
?
I didn't say that!
"Do you mean me, then!"
?
"I didn't say that, either!"
"I'll fix you, if you call me a thief!"
"I won't let you off, either!"
What are you doing?
Beat you for calling us thieves!
Don't run!
Stop!
You again!
?
"Fate brings us together, from however far I bet your 109,200 miles are right here!"
Right beside your Nanking's 18 mounds!
Oh no-here comes Mr. Ugly!
A basket of grapes isn't worth this!
Two heads think better than one
Let's talk this thing over!
"Yes, we walk on two legs"
We can't let a quadruped best us!

"If a man's unlucky, he'll see ghosts in the sun?"
Pick a little more!
Can I ask your name!
What task?
"Come to Wu Yen Road,"
You'll see a black car 9413.
On Friday thirteenth?
Just get into the car and I'll tell you what to do.
"Remember: better come early than late, late than never."
Right way!
"Not now, tonight!"
Tonight?
Then what shall I do now?
I even sent my secretary away!
Find something to do to kill time.
I haven't taken my milk yet.
Nuisance really!
Taxi...!
Shut up!
What the hell are you yelling about?
Damn you!
Shit!
"You think this is a night market, shut up!"
"Get lost, or I'll call the police."
Damn you!
"- Hi, Hitler!"
"- Hurry up, go!"
Go to the front!
Don't turn around!
There's match inside the drawer.
"Listen, a Jew has taken a ""Beast"" to H.K. from Europe."
To be handed to an American.
Your task is to help him find the American.
What does he look like?
The Jew will tell you.
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Not this one.
Never got their zoning approved by the city.
Still an old warehouse.

Something's not right here.
"- Go, Dave and I will cover Mejia."
- Let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
Is anybody hurt?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
The steering locked up.
The thing veered off the road.
- Can you get it started?
"- No, it's shut down."
It's not going anywhere.
I'm calling Martello.
"Uh, we're on radio silence"
"He's right, we don't want to give away our position."
I think you really need to talk to him.
Just to play it safe.
Jenkins.
Let me handle Martello.
You come with me.
"The rest of you, stay here, and wait for a recovery vehicle."
Would you like some tea?
Thank you
"Oh, no thank you."
- Would you like some?
- No.
"Are you sure, it's very good!"
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Gate away from me!
Ronon!
It's alright.
It's OK.
"They hate me, don't they father?"
No...
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not gonna change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, Colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
"Yes, why?"
I just found another victim.
"Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
Looks as though Zaddik may have been telling the truth after all.
We must defend ourselves!
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
My father gave us that.
This is yours.
Remember this?
"Oh, no."
Can we just do this without any theatrics?
Please.
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?
"You know, with the boys."
Some kind ofthing so they don't forget we were once-
What are you doing?
Richard?
Leave them alone.
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.
"Objectively speaking, if you weren't my children... would you think, that guy looks okay?"
He looks like a guy who might have a wife and kids and stuff?
- Are you mad at us?
"- Yeah, totally."
I think you look good.
"Okay, good."
"Space, space, dash."
Is that a Bengal tiger?
I don't know.
"Space, space, space."
Dash.
"And in the dark of the night, and it does get dark... when I call a name-"
When I call a name.
It'll be your name.
What's your name?
Nevermind.
Let's go.
"Mom, mommy, I've found Daddy!"
"Dad, we've been looking for you."
Look at the stones I've gathered!
"Igor, what is this?"
You've spent two hours in the cold wind with your bronchitis!
But I finished my sketch.
Now I know what my new painting will look like.
You're like a child.
Let's go home.
Farewell!
I hope you'll overcome your fears.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Anya?
Anya?
Anechka?
Show me your sketch.
It's nothing special.
It's beautiful.
"Hello, partner!"
How was Paris?
- Any problems?
-The entrance is closed.
"It must be opened, then."
It's not possible.
We're waiting for a government delegation
But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
We have a charter flight!
You can lose your driver's license for that!
How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!
Adam...
The auction is about to start.
Christos hasn't turned up
What an idiot.
What's he playing?
You have to run the auction.
Me?
Yes.
Fuck!
Christos!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You're the oldest.
"It has to be a Clios, naturally."
That's the way things are done.
"This night, this gala might affect the situation of every one of us."
Great.
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.
This is all very impressive.
That's very kind of you.
A vision!
"Oh, forgive me..."
I had a few things I had to tie up.
"Please, not another word."
"So impressive of you, I thought, to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss."
"I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't..."
"No, not at all!"
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.
And you went to I.A.?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you crazy?
Apparently.
I'll take the lead on this.
You jump in if you have a question.
Joe Penn?
Yeah.
We need to talk to you about the complaint you filed.
I already told you guys everything last night.
We're with Internal Affairs.
We conduct our own investigation.
I'm kinda busy.
You wanna retract your statement?
Then tell us what happened.
"I'm drinking a beer, talking to my buds."
"Out of nowhere, this dickmo flies--"
- Which dickmo would that be?
- The big ugly one.
Taggot?
He starts going off on Val.
- Who's Val?
- The bartender.
Taggot was drunk.
How do you know?
- You could tell.
- But how?
Were you sitting next to him?
"Did you buy his drinks, count how many he had?"
"Was he slurring his words, stumbling--"
Why would you assume officer Taggot was drunk?
'Cause Val was trying to cut him off.
Even afterworking hard all day..
"..even after starving, I collected only 900 rupees."
I cant understand what to do.
"Brother, this is Mumbai city."
"If you lose hope so soon, then.."
..you wont be able to do anything.
Then what else should I do?
"How can a man, who earns just 50 or 100 rupees.."
"..a day, pay back sirs Ioan worth lakhs of rupees?"
"If your intentions are good, then you can do anything."
No!
"To earn money, a man needs to be smart.."
..cunning and educated.
"And I am an illiterate, a duffer, foolish."
What can I do?
Everything will be alright.
God is there.

She left early.
"She must of had her reasons, or whatever."
"Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital..."
- or do you just want to go to school?

Your mom says that it's up to you.

"You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?"
And you've got the estimates?
Right?

"Who's in there, what happened?"
Nothing happened.
I'm fine.

What are you doing here anyway?
- You are playing this all wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Please.
"Your dad's seriously sick, right?"
You shouldn't even be here.
"People are feeling sorry for you, right?"
- Use it.
Take advantage.
"- You're saying... I'm saying, you have a personal tragedy with a loved one."
I can understand why people would want to pay to see her.
"Well, Julia, surely not."
(Julia):
"What are we doing but watching her, William?"
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?
- Five cents.
- Ten.
"A nickel, final offer!"
What do you know?

Here.
"You stay out of trouble, alright?"
"So, the victim was definitely attacked here at Travis's campsite."
Which the lying sod failed to tell us he moved.

He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.

"Hey, stop for a sec."
Hello?
I'm leaving.
"Yes, I'll rehearse first, then head to the venue early."
After the show?
Okay.
Good morning.

"Morning, sir."
"Room 302, door is open."
"Room 302, occupied."
Streetwalkers often stand outside.
"If they enter, ask them to leave."
Anything else?
The whole second floor is rented to a porn shoot from 11 AM.
"No need to clean that floor, then."
"Well, until 5 PM."
"Say, Manager, we're almost out of 100 yen coins."
"Oh, hell."
Borrow some from Atlas 2.
"Sato, go there later."
I caught a cold.
"And without insurance, I can't see a doctor."
"Fine, I'll go."
Sorry for the trouble.
I can't lose this time!
"Mrs. Brendan, I believe I can explain."
"You see, Willy, here, had a tummy ache last night."
"There was no place for him to sleep, so I invited him to stay in my drawing room."
"Well, I..."
I think that was highly commendable.
I apologize if I have violated any rules.
"Well, under these circumstances..."
Meeting's adjourned.
That's right.
"I'm sorry, Nancy."
"Well, I..."
I better be going.
"Now, it would be a shame to lose such an adorable little boy so soon."
Why don't you stay for the Saturday night party?
I'm sure you'd enjoy meeting all the little girls.
"No, I think I'd better be running along."
Good.

"I'll see you later, Willy."
- Yachting.

Would you look at that fucking eejit?
Can you not just say eejit?
That's what I did say.
Where are you going?
- Toilet.
"- Jesus, again?"

"No, you can't have a bike."
"It's not his birthday for ages yet, is it?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"There's nothing on the telly tonight, is there?"
There's never anything on.
"Oh, you're right, of course... but there's absolutely nothing on tonight, is there?"
I suppose a ride is out of the question?
Hang on till I get this line done.
You serious?
I suppose so.
Fucking great.
You're not messing now?
No.
Just let me finish the next line.
I'll go up and brush me teeth.
That'll be nice.
Um...

"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination."
Now they have a delightful social aspect.
"Amy, you must've been in the bathroom with other women before."
Of course I have.
But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
Great!
You do know Bernie's doesn't allow dogs?
I panicked.
"The only thing I could think of was, ""Sorry,"

You should probably work on your excuses.
I can't just make up lies on the spot.
Why is my experiment a different colour to everyone else's?
"Probably, because you're right and everyone else is wrong."
"Listen, Maddy was just saying how she can't make it tonight."
Why?
Because...
I just remembered...
I have to stay in and... help Mam with...curtains.
- Curtains?
- Yeah.
She's really into crafts all of a sudden.
I said I'd hold them while she...sews.
- Can't she do it another time?
- She's got a deadline.
Sorry.
Oh.
OK.
See?
You can do it.
Finally.
- We're early.
- Just.
We came straight from school.
It just seemed to take longer.
I know.
"Too much to see, too much to smell."
"- What, screw with you?"
Because I can.
You're my son.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't be 15 minutes early like you are.
I have an actual job I go to.

Do you two need a minute?
I can come back.
No.
It's fine.
"What are you having, Dad?"
I'm buying.
I'll have a couple of scrambled.
Is that all?
You don't want bacon?
You love bacon.
Get bacon.
He loves bacon.
Get him some bacon.
Rye toast.
Right?
And I'll have scrambled egg whites and avocado.
Thank you.
Avocado?
Is that what you eat with your lawyer friends?
Avocado.
- I'll be right back.
Why do we...
"Can we just, like, try to have a normal conversation of some kind?"
I'm not starting anything.
- Fine.
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Together!
Yeah!
"-Yeah, that's the most, yeah."
-The Nike shop?

"-Zayn, shall we go in here?"
"-Oh, my God!"

"We don't come out that often so we don't really see, Iike, this sort of side of it that often."
"So when we do, it's all a bit strange."

"I think she wanted to keep it, but I was like:"
"""That's mine, love, you can't have that, unfortunately."
"It's connected."""

Where'd the glasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.
I put them on.
These are sick.
You got that?
"Got that,"

We were up late.
For a good cause.
"Sure, loitering in a bar at 2 AM, after defacing the wall of a Government building, how can I fault you for being so admirable!"
- Anything else?
- A lead on the van jobs.
A Serbian arms-dealer:
Victor Dragan.
We got a tip off from an informant.
A reliable source?
Not at all.
What do you say?
I know the fellow.
A sadistic loner.
"Barring a lucky break, he'll be tough to nail."
Luck can be engineered.

"Vrinks, you stay."
I've been appointed Police Commissioner.
As of when?
I take over on Sept 1.
Congratulations.
I hate to leave before I've cleaned house.
"I want that gang, Leo."
As my farewell gift.
You'll get them.
Another thing:
someone will get my desk.
You're the right man.
Klein wants to be Chief.
They were sent to the shooter.
We traced the I.P. address.
Comes straight from this office.
(sighs)
O-Only I couldn't have sent these.
See the date and the time?
I wasn't here;
I was with a client at a hotel on Kalakaua.
I can prove it.
"Okay, Abby, who else has got access to your computer?"
Just my assistant Andrew.
He's taking off.
Hey.
Hey!
(siren wailing nearby)
(truck horn blaring)
(tires screech)
You should've let me die.
"Andrew, why would you do this?"
"I'm in love with you, Abby."
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to stop.
Unrequited love.

Yeah.

Gettin' tougher.
"Too many people like your cousin here, gettin' sent back."
"Look man, I ain't tryin' to come back."
"So, you intend to cease your criminal activities then?"
(chuckles)
Right...
"Well, a passport, 25,000 US dollars."
"Yo, what happened to fifteen?"
That was years ago!
"Now, homeland security, makin' tings a lot tougher for the little man."
"The normal rate is 30,000 US dollars."
"So, guys..."
Take it or leave it.
Let's go.
Fuck you mean we got no money!
?
"Sorry, I tried a thing, I got jacked--"
"I told you stay off that shit, didn't I tell you?"
I told you!
"Money got tight, alright--"
What do you mean money got tight?
Huh?
!
"When I got pinched, we had enough cash!"
All you had to do was stay in school.
"I dropped out, okay?"
!
What do you mean you dropped out?
!
"No, man!"
"Alton, what are you talking about?"
!
No!
Stop!
There's been an accident!
Please help me!
"Oh, God!"
Thank you.
How are you today?
Fine.
Have you ever been in San Francisco?
Yeah.
In Buffalo?
"Who are you, mister?"
You know who I am.
You did time in Buffalo.
"In Wichita, armed robbery, reduced to attempted assault."
-Could we talk about this another day?
-St.
Louis you held up a card game.
"Moline, Illinois, 13 months."
Assault on a railroad investigator.
They gave me something.
If you plead innocent and make me try you for homicide I'm going to see that you pay.
What're you sayin'?
This have something to do with this accident?
-I wasn't even driving.
"-Oh, you weren't even driving."
You were too drunk to drive.
You were too drunk to walk.
"You have a witness at the filling station, yes."
Who do you think you're dealing with?
-I know you killed him.
-Come on.
Enjoying yourself?
Don't be stupid.
This is work.
So flirting with girls is part of your job?
Seeing you grinning makes me want to puke.
Are you getting jealous?
You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
Yeah we're good we're just here working on our calves.
Hey Drew.
- Hey hi...
Who was that?
Oh I know... that's a...
That's a client Jill!
Got back off!
Yeah right that's what it is!
Every single...
Jill called her engagement a match made in heaven.
Watching them squabble about wedding cakes and the medicinal benefits of anal sex
I couldn't help but think that Heaven has a strange sense of humor.
I'll call you later OK.
Ok.
- Ok.
Come on Bowie.
Bowie?
Terrible name.
Listen I want to try it...
Its just one little...
We can't even go hiking...
Just one time.
No!
You know that camera looks very good on you.
Aww you think?
So what are you going to do with these pictures?
I don't know.
Maybe sell them on the internet.
Make some money off your ass.
Album cover my man.
I'm telling you.
Want some?
You okay?
Can I get you anything?
"[Screaming] Oh, stop!"
"Pick your head up again, and I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
Stay right there.
Okay.
[Engine starting]
[Tires screeching]
[Cheering] Woo!
"All right, all right, all right!"
Good to see our fuckin' guy back.
You scared the shit out of him!
- I can't take these guys.
- And what'd we get?
I can drive this fucking car better than you can.
"What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man?"
"What, what, what?"
Twenties and thirties.
"Oh, hey, I got it."
I got eleven.
"Hey, man, how much money we get?"
Nothin'.
We didn't get anything!
"Sam, you in there?"
You better give me my fucking share.
- Bullshit.
- There's tomorrow.
"Yeah, there's always tomorrow."
There's always tomorrow.
"You pissed, you pissed, and this goes."
It goes.
"Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this!"
- What am I missing?
"- Perspective, for one."
That's a loss and a win.
How is that the downfall of my gym?
You worried?
No.
[Chuckles] Come on.
"Alvey, you got to be a little concerned."
Not a bit.
And this isn't an interview.
"Well, I appreciate the apology, but it's not necessary."
"You know what, you haven't seen my gym, right?"
Let me give you the 10-cent tour.
"This way, the next time you butcher me, you know what the fuck you're talking about."
- Mind if I take some photos?
"- Whatever you need, Mario."
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Lisa's looking for you.
She's in her office.
All right.
I'll be right there.
What's up?
Shut the door.
I saw you training with Alvey today.
"Oh, man, I fucking sucked."
I was so nervous.
He was impressed.
He made it a point to tell me that.
- No shit.
- No shit.
"Well, of course it's legal."
Man:
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

[Gavel banging]
[Men shout indistinctly] _
We have been debating this for far too long!
How old must a maid or a woman child be to enter the bonds of matrimony?
- [Men shout indistinctly] - 13!
- 12!
- 10!
- [Gavel banging] - 7!
Why even even put a number on it?
Because the federal elitists are suggesting 18.
- [Men shout indistinctly]
- No!
It's our choice!
- That's why I am proposing 16.
- No!
It's too old!
They call it lucky 7 for a reason!
Man: 14 with father's consent!

"Well, y'all oughta get some perspective."
"Why, in Uzbekistan, girls get married at the first hint of a menstrual cycle."
Ew!
"[Lowered voice] If he comes at you, punch to the throat, swift kick to the balls, okay?"
- This doesn't feel right.
- But it is right.
Your ex-wife... she haunts you.
Even she thinks this is wrong.

CAL:
What are they doing?
(tires screeching)
(Cal shouts)
(Cal grunts)
(Cal grunts)
Federal agents!
Hands up!
Get out the car!
LASALLE:
"You okay, Dana?"
"Yeah, I think so."
Nice driving.
"You, too."
(grunts)
"Can't guarantee Dana won't spend some time behind bars, Mr. Connors."
"I mean, after all, she was complicit until she wasn't."
"Yeah, I know."
"But I spoke to the federal prosecutors, told them everything she did to help us bring down the crew."
"Plus, she's cooperating, so I'm hopeful."
"At least one way or the other, she's out from underneath it... finally... and safe."
That's all I wanted.
That's all Jared would've wanted.
Take care.
Yeah.
(clears throat)
Poor dude.
He's been through a lot.
"Gonna go through a lot more, too."
"Losing a child, nothing harder."
Sort of know how he feels.
"I'm afraid not, m'lady."
Put your helmet on.
"Oh, that's splendid."
(* The Wedding March)
- Get on with it.
- What shall I say?
Make it up.
(Clears throat)
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together... to marry that parrot... to that parrot."
- Amen.
- Amen.
"Hear, hear."
Go on.
"Now, if there is anyone here, who knows of any just cause or impediment why these two parrots should not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace."
Amen.
Aagh.
What's next?
What's next?
Who givethetheth?
- What?
- Who givethetheth?
Who giveth this parrot?
I do.
Where's the ring?
What are you talking about?
You're as potty as she is.
(Clears throat) I now pronounce you Parrot and Mrs Parrot.
"Those that I have joined together, let no parrot put asunder."
"Oh, it's so beautiful."
I always cry at weddings.
Is that all?
The best man may now kiss the bride.
- How many?
- Five riders.
Maybe more.
Hyah!
Shh.

PORTHOS:
Red Guards.
"Aramis, you are to return with us to the palace."
The King commands it.
"We have business, on behalf of Minister Treville."
Are you questioning a royal order?
"No, believe me, if we were, we wouldn't be taking it up with the messenger boy."
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)
"If you come now, you won't be arrested."
Very well.
I'll see you back at the garrison.
Get him some food.
"You'll stay here until nightfall then, we'll take you out of Paris under cover of darkness."
"And please don't draw attention to yourself, hmm?"
Where are you going?
I must make sure my absence has not been noted.
But I will be back.
"Oh, and remember, if any of Grimaud's men ask your name, it is?"
"- ""Victor""."
I know.
"- Yes, quite right."
(CHUCKLES)
Victor!

"Sharon, it's not fair!"
You've been in there ages!
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.
"You all right in there, Sharon?"
Yeah.
Coming.
"Ah, no, no."
There's no hurry.
"No, I've been in already."
Ohh...
"Jesus, what were you drinking last night?"
I'm going back to bed.
"Ah, yeah, go on."
Good girl.
"I'll go on without you, what?"
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.
Get in there and get your clothes on.
"Go down to get your breakfast... and get a bleedin' job for yourself, right?"
"Sharon, we're going to have to tell them."
"Stop it, will yous?"
I haven't stepped out
What about your apprentice?
If we're that skillful... we'd have rebelled long ago!
Get out!
"Okay, okay."
"Master, I'll take you to bed"
"Big Brother, Fan's death is questionable"
Do you think it's the old fart that did this?
That's not possible
The old fool does not have that ability!
It must be someone from the outside!
Who could it be?
The killer is in the temple
I am waiting for you
Very good!
Very good!
It's better than a stage performance!
Relax
You are too slow
Watch out!
Look clearly
"So it's you, you short-lived asshole!"
Don't be so mean!
Don't you want to know who killed Fan San?
Who is he?
Watch carefully!
I am the killer
Why did you kill him?
Because Jin Tianyun is my friend
Jin Tianyun!
How nasty!
I'm still a virgin!
- Only because you lick the alphabet.
- He what?
He licks the alphabet to fight the monotony.
"A, B, C..."
"Bon appetit, Frank."
- What is going on?
- It's these two studs' latest thing.
- You lick the alphabet?
It's...
- It's a bit gross.
- How unromantic.
You do that?
- Casper taught Frank to do it.
- I could've thought of it myself.
"- Look, buster!"
Don't discuss our sex life with him!
I didn't.
Then how does he know what you do?
- I don't know...
- I won't have it!
- Let me finish...
- No!
"You fuck retards and lick the alphabet, you jerk!"
"- Please don't move your leg, Casper."
- I thought you were handicapped.
- I'm sorry about the retard.
- That was a lousy thing to do.
- Golf tomorrow?
- You bet.
It's nice and peaceful.
All you hear is an...
- What do you call that bird?
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan B.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do one very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
(distorted) Lydia!
a project by @olivethewenno enjoy watching
"Is that you, Ines?"
I said...
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!
It doesn't hurt?
It won't hurt me?
"Oh God, my dear!"
Who did it?
What happened?
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.
Even for you.
Do you think he will forgive me?
He will.
But I won't.
Is it time to get him?
For me?
What do you mean?
"A week with you, in 10 years of our marriage!"
- Anais...
- That's all I get.
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'II kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.

"Monsieur Chopin, you were in the middle of a miracle."
I'm not quite yet cured.
How did you get in?
Who are you?
I am your slave.
And you have summoned me with your music.
"Oh, yes."
I think I know who you are.
I have heard you described.
"Madame Sand, rumour has it you are a woman, and so I must ask you to leave my private chambers."
Have I offended your modesty?
I apologise.
- play me one more piece and I'II go.
- This is ridiculously improper!
And frightening as well.
please leave now.
Hard-boiled types only have last names.
- Buckley.
- Taken.
And what were you before you became Cole?
Catherine Pugh.
- Catherine?
- Catrin's the Welsh version.
"It was his idea. ""A beautiful Welsh girl deserves a beautiful Welsh name."""
Where would you have drawn the line?
"""Cardiff Cole."
Caerphilly Cole.
"Coalmine Cole."""
- Hey!
Those were my chips!
"Right, Catherine Pugh, you're coming with me."
All right.
"- Brannigan, Johnnie, positions."
- No.
"Uh, no, thank you."
- Let...
Let me.
"Quiet, please."
"Quiet, please, everyone."
Thank you.
I'll give you a finger click for a sniper shot.
"Just a very quiet click, please."
"It's hard to explain to a non-actor, but I want to react to the sniper up there and not the click down here."
Do you see?
"In fact, there's no chance of firing a real gun up there, is there?"
- No.
- Right.
Going for a take.
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
"Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?"
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know people.
Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why?
We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
And take this cucumber.
Nefedov gave it to me.
Eat!
"Ok, you'll have it later."
"OK, I'll go."
May I?
Katya!
Thanks.
It is so good to be a lieutenant.
The comm girls wash your shirts.
That's right.
"Well, Malakhov, some people have bread on their butter and some - pains in their asses."
"-Actually, this line does not rhyme."

But there will be no way out.
That's for sure.

I know.
The next one.
"The next one, please!"

You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
-Will this take me home?
-If that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
"A crazy, mad, wonderful idea."
But I can't.
"There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do."
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will.
How could I forget?

I haven't the slightest idea.

Good Lord.
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
"I'm sorry, Hamish."
I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.

I think you can beat Shaolin.
Tat-chi!
Monk Ming-dun!
"Tat-chi, your Chin Kang Fist has progressed remarkably."
"And if you can improve your physical strength as well, nobody can beat you."
Thanks for your kind teaching.
You never practice.
Sir?
You always act as if it's for real.
You must be hiding something.
"Actually, the real reason why I wanted to join the Shaolin was purely to get revenge."
"Amida Buddha, who is your enemy?"
Wu-tang!
Wu-tang?
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.
If you're just going to give it away...
"If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike."
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I like to report a hit-and-run.
I'm still gonna need to record your statement.
"Later, right now I just want to..."
Just want to sleep.
Who are you?
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
No!
Trevor?
You still got a half-hour.
I could fix you some eggs.
I'm tired.
But thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."

- From your paycheck?
"- Back off, Tucker."
You know it's against regulations.
- See?
- Oh...
That's... clap!
"One, two, three, four, five battle."
Alright tardy cake!
"- No, you're first!"
- You are... no.
You do this and...
Hey!
Look who's here?
We just saw your stupid little girl friend.
Had to tell about herself.
You should see her face.
Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns.
"Yea, we took our time doin' it too."
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together.
Even when things are getting up before them.
Step aside jail-bait!
Or don't!
If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you.
"Do it, do what they say, Daisy."
Can I ask you fellas something?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
Excuse me?
Please.
- Everybody!
- Please.
Very good!
But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware!
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.
"Hi, Riley."
ASHLEY:
I think the tie is a bit much.
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.
Then maybe lose the jacket.
"You know, it's 80 degrees out."
It looks like you don't own a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.
"I don't know, I think it looks nice."
Yeah.
"Nice, just kind of sweaty."
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.
"- OK, bye."
- Bye.
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.
- Huh?
- Your collar.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'd seriously consider having a better answer to that question if I were you.
"I'm filling up notebooks, but it's nothing but worthless garbage."
Don't tell people that.
Makes you look lazy and stupid.
Got it.
That probably came out a lot crueller than I intended.
But don't make being lackadaisical and disorganised your thing.
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.
He did not come.
Would he be it?
Major lord!
Major lord!
Please!
We are us here.
The Tót family.
The kind Tót family.
Oh finally.
"Tót lord,right?"
Mariska.
And she:
Ági.
"We welcome it with affection the kind major lord and we desire it, feel well in our modest home."
Very kind.
"Says Tót,it is not possible to silence this uproar?"
!
Stop it!
Yeah.
This is the good air.
This silence.
Believe it.
In constant noises and smelliness of 9 monthly a service working...
- What did I talk about?
- That in constant noise and smelliness...
That's right.
I cannot believe in the fact that I am at home
I know everything as your kind son wrote the things though.
"That Bábony... this the valley of Bartalapos kind Tót, we behind my back?"
Only Klein beer garden and the parsonage
Good.
"I ask it from you, live so, as if I would not be here."
Because they're more...
There are not so many cliques and...
- Why are you telling me?
- Would you like a glass of water?
"Helene, come here."
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we have to decide.
"You don't need me any more, Helene."
"Everything is taken care of now, right?"
Anna and the boys...
I'll just slow you all down.
- Stop.
- No.
I'm the only one stopping for now.
I just mean...
Do you think you and Jacob will get together?
Do you?
Stop it.
I would like to know.
I just didn't want you to see me...
like this.
"This is only the beginning, Helene."
It will get worse from now on.
- Can you manage?
- Yes.
I'm so damned pathetic...
I don't want to...
I don't want to die!
"I don't, Helene."
"I don't want to, damn it!"
I don't want to die!
I don't!
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
"Oh, wow..."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"Oh, man."
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume!
Oops.
Heh heh!
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes!
Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
"Oh, I help women, too."
You call me if he needs anything.
60cc's of gastrografin and check the K.U.B.
What's this?
Nursing home dump.
I'm changing G-tubes on comatose patients now.
- How's your M.I.?
- Unstable angina.
"Just out of curiosity, what type of guy hires a satisfaction facilitator?"
I believe it's the...
politically correct term
"- for ""call girl"" these days."
- A smart one?
We have a saying in Croatia.
"- You know, ""If it floats, flies or..."""
- Fornicates?
Rent it.
"- Hey, Dr. Kovac."
- Hello.
I thought I might take you up on that offer for some coffee.
- If you got a minute?
- Sure.
Page me if you need me.
How many stitches?
"7 on the forehead, 5 on the cheek, 12 all together."
That's not so bad.
"Neela, this is Brad, Judy's husband."
"Hey, baby."
"- Honey, I'm so sorry."
"- Oh, come on."
It wasn't your fault.
The police told me what happened.
Your hair is diff--
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, you look great."
You look awesome.
Sorry.
What am I even saying?
You look different and--
"- Kumar Patel, you're flustered."
- Little bit.
"So, what's up with you?"
You still dating the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?
"Actually, it's Brooks Brothers."
Colton!
"How are you, buddy?"
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.
And we're not dating anymore.
No.
We...are getting married.
"Congratulations, you guys."
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Next week.
It's going to be a perfect day.
"I mean, that's assuming we get those Stargazer lilies for the bouquets."
This florist has been a complete nightmare.
Fucking assholes.
Colton's practically planning the whole wedding all by himself.
"So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you off the leash for a little vay-cay?"
"I own that place now, Colton."
We've already begun to evacuate the plant.
"Tony's here, all right."
Get me down.
"Thank you, thank you."
"Now, where are you going?"
In there.
"Oh, no."
You can't go beyond this point without IDs.
Tony!
- Tia!
- I knew it.
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.
We cannot let her take it away from us.
Tony!
"Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia."
She cannot break through my power of control.
- Acknowledge.
"- Tony, what's wrong?"
"It's me, your sister."
Try to remember me.
Acknowledge.
Tony?
"- Yes, sir."
- Get those kids.
She'll use some of those molecules on us.
"I'll take care of her before she gets a chance, you get them."
I can't get through.
I don't know what they've done to his mind.
We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves.
How do you spell cooling?
Come on.
He never went anywhere without it.
It's missing.
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Phone ringing]
Man:
"Hey, Duval."
[Sighs]
_
[Cellphone rings]
[Sighs]
What?
James:
Question.
Remember that promise you made to Kevin Whitfield's parents?
You want to make good on it?
What do you know about Kevin Whitfield?
Just what you told me back then.
I've been going over it.
"You know, uh, the backpack that was missing."
You thought it was connected to the killing.
Are you reading my notes?
"I, uh, I took a picture of it, and I sent it to my friends."
They did some kind of search.
"You know, like the dents and scratches on the backpack make it like a fingerprint?"
Did you know that?
[Beeping]
They looked at 5 million pictures and finally came up with the perfect match.
"One double-bacon BLT sandwich, nice and hot."
Thank you.
Duval:
Where are you?
Are you at my house?
- Totally you.
"Hey, guys, check it out."
"The deluxe limited edition ""Wild West and Witches"""
expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector's tin.
LEONARD:
"Come on, no!"
We just bought the regular pack.
"Ooh, a sheriff's badge."
(chuckles)
"Yeah, it's also a wand."
With a hologram?
Nice!
"Hey, do you see this?"
"I'm in the matrix, Leonard;"
I see everything.
You got to be kidding me.
You friended Stuart on Facebook?
I thought you didn't like Facebook anymore.
Don't be silly.
I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Please.
You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Really?
"You think I care if a man, what,"
"""shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady""?"
You're so full of it.
You are free to believe whatever you like.
And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
You unfriended me?
Seriously?
"Oh, yeah."
"What are you thinking, Walter?"
"Hey, guys."
The footage from the abduction has been downloaded.
"Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum..."
- ...with some kind of weird writing in it.
- They think it was his?
"Well, they don't know, but Agent Broyles is sending it over."
OLIVIA:
Have we ID'd the victim?
ASTRID:
"No, not yet."
OLIVIA:
"Wait a minute, Astrid."
Can you zoom it?
Now freeze it.
"Peter, that isn't him."
That's a different guy.
There's more than one Observer.
Stop.
Hold on.
What just happened right there?
Was he hit?
Who are these people?
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- You don't have to do this to me.
"I'll probably do the same with Priscilla now that she's back in town, God help me."
If it works out with Jarmusch
I'll be so distracted that I'll forget about Suzanne.
"Movies equal money, women, glamour..."
- more women.
- I like that.
That's positive thinking.
- But is any of it meaningful?
"- No, but it's fun."
There's Jarmusch.
"All right, let's go."
All right?
Look at that hair.
This is...
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
We just met.
Miriam.
Nice to meet you.
George Christopher.
And this is Jonathan ames.
- The man I want to meet.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Could you excuse us?
We have some business to talk over.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Are those hummingbirds?
They're dipping their beaks into flowers.
I love them.
- What was your name again?
- Miriam.
"So I really loved your novel... dark, funny, perverted, beautiful."
Let me give you your coat.
That's all right.
It's OK.
Thanks a lot.
Ralphie.
"Hello, boy."
How you been?
What a good boy.
Can I buy you breakfast?
I know this great little diner.
Sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Well, seeing as you caught the killer..."
I figured the least I could do... was write you some lyrics.
So...
There once was a dick from The Windy City
"Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty"
He told her goodbye...
But he had no reason why...
That's all I got so far.
"Well, I was soaked to the marrow"
I was chilled to the heart
I took shelter in her room
She called me from the corner
Of a song I never liked
For the occasion that was in there
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
You call me a bear?
!
Relax...
See that he doesn't move.
Sit down there!
"What's up, sir?"
Do you know him?
Who is he?
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.
"Of course, I will!"
He's Laxmi's husband.
Her husband?
!
No!
I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!
He says his name is Banwari.
And you said her husband's name was Durgaprasad!
"Have I told you that, too?"
Are there two husbands then?
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.
Laxmi fondly addresses Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
"He's down, he's bleeding, and you gotta get there."
"But there's lights, right?"
"All over the city, red lights."
You go through the red lights.
"Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail, you go through the red lights."
Hello?
Something wrong?
Carter?
What are you doing?
"We really can't help you anymore, sir."
I'm not a junkie.
"The stuff just finds me, you know?"
How convenient.
I need another room for Mr. Hudlin.
He says Exam 3 is full of ectoplasm.
- Did you cut yourself shaving?
- What?
Never mind.
Lipstick.
- Dr. Carter...
"- Mrs. Breeland, you need to stay in bed."
"Otherwise, we might be tempted to put somebody else in it."
"Okay, I think we're getting there."
Hardly.
Board number two is for the patients in the halls.
"We have heat exhaustion, barbecue-smoke inhalation, and boils."
All up for grabs.
- I love my job.
"- No, you don't."
Why are you dressed like that if you can't prescribe nothing?
The smell of fresh med students in the morning.
What is it about them?
They all seem so...
- Gullible?
Immature?
Vapid?
- I was going to say sweet.
Made right.
- Made right?
- Orders from the fleet.
Take your hands off me.
You mutinous filth!
Don't think you can soon be forgiven.
- It's not easy.
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
I would advise you to say no more.
You're compounding the offence!
You're in it with them!
Your friends will be dealt with.
"When their lordships hear what I have to say, you're done."
You're under arrest.
You've done for us all.
What's it matter?
You all wanted him dead.
You're as bad as him.
"And between you, you've finished all of us."
Give me a knife!
Get back!
"We had everything, and he took it from us!"
- Let's go.
- While the fog's thick.
"They're right, Vizard."
I want no sound.
We're gonna weigh anchor and make sail.
- Weigh anchor.
- Quiet now.
Anchor aweigh!
Set the courses!
Course west-sou'west.
- Passports.
I left my jacket.
What did you say about passports?
- I had the jacket when I was at the table.
Did you leave passports there?
"I'm sorry, sire."
We left the passports.
- Thing?
"Christ, you will know now that we have lied."
You've been drinking all night.
- We have to get out of this way
And leave the Balkans.
Believe me when I say
"That it is best not to make him piss, that guy."
I can assure you that there will be heels.
"So, are we now pursued by a crazy Turkish and a crazy Serbian?"
The quickest way to go is to cross the sea to Italy.
But there is another border.
Montenegro.
Let's go.
I drive.
Sire?
Ludovic?
I am very ashamed.
I know.
I have to resign.
"No, Ludovic."
"He served me well, I count on her."
I failed completely.
"No, nothing at all."
Sire.
Here is the frontier.
"- I'm so frustrated, Claire."
"Give him an ""I want sex"" look."
He'll think something's in my eye.
You have to generate heat.
"Sometimes, I swear he feels it."
Men aren't that bright.
It's easy.
"Be subtle, mysterious, seductive."
"Subtle, mysterious, seductive?"
Why don't men come with instructions?
- More coffee?
- Thanks.
My tickets just arrived.
My first lecture is in Paris on the 24th.
I leave Saturday.
- Do you want an English muffin?
"- No, thanks."
- I'm off.
I have an early class.
- All right.
Have a nice day.
"- Oh, by the way..."
- Mmm?
Would saying now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?
Or should we wait till you come back from Europe?
"Yeah, that's better."
"No, no..."
That's fine.
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day.
- Have you ever tried making love?
I really don't know how much longer
I can do this whole peace and love thing.
"It's the Amity way, all right?"
We're just trying to blend in.
Mus SCOFFS)
I'm trying to blend in.
It's just not working.
PETER:
Comin' through on your right.
"Okay, here we go."
"Hey, look, a rainbow."
- Oh.
-it's pretty.
WOMAN:
Go with happiness.
Virtual pathological friendliness with unquestioned passivism?
I love this place.
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey, Tris, I really like your hair, by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that?
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down, huh?"
Or what?
"Besides, I think we should all stick together now that we're"
-all officially fugitives.
-TRIS:
Shh.
"Wait, what do you mean, ""officially fugitives""?"
"- Oh, you don't know?"
"-Let's go, let's go."
You didn't tell Caleb?
Switzerland?
Switzerland.
"So it's a sort of, appropriately enough, kind of neutral typeface."
What could you have got?
Do you know that typeface?
"Oh, yes!"
"I would have thought you would, actually."
Tell me?
I use it in day-to-day life.
You must do.
Invented by Microsoft for their Windows operating system.
"So, you got two out of a maximum five."
"Which means you're trailing the Lutrophiles, you're on six,"
They're on ten.
"Team Lutrophiles, your turn again."
Which topic would you like?
We are left with...
Shall we go for Geography now?
I say go for Geography.
All right.
"I think we'll go for Geography, please."
"Geography, that was an easy decision."
You're looking for waterfalls.
You have ten seconds to confer.
"Dettifoss, Angel..."
Horseshoe...
Niagara...
"Is it, Orinoco?"
Something like that?
Time's up.
Cameroon.
"-Marianne, we're going to start with you."
You know what I like about rich kids?
"Bam, nothing."
"Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider me rich, would you?"
I'd be more upper middle class?
"What's up, fool?"
"You know, you didn't have to hit him."
Sorry.
"You know, the cashier called the cops."
"Look, I don't know why Luke does that."
Did that.
He's just...
An ass?
Protective.
God.
It's my mom.
And... your dad.
It's been awhile.
Figure out what kind of shape this place is in.
Wow.
Oh.
That's what...those contractors have been doing.
This place is fantastic!
You think so?
You don't think it's too much?
Too much?
You're talking to the guy whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco.
This is gorgeous.
The high ceilings and the molding.
It reminds me of...
Your parent's house.
On Elm Grove.
"Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams."
Hallucination brought on by over-tiredness say what?
"Do not ""say what"" me."
I invented that.
Oh please that was so me.
Do you really want to have this argument?
No.
'Cause I know it was me.
Now my friends are not gonna hate me.
So just poof right back in my head where you belong.
They're gonna hate you they're gonna hate you.
-Oh real mature.
-Oh real mature.
[Both muttering]
[Mimicking Miley]
I cannot believe I'm having this argument with myself.
[Groans]
Let me ask you something son.
You ever thought about medical school?
Law school?
Any school?
[Clicks tongue]
Of course not.
Sorry I took so long.
Sometimes it takes a while to shake off Hannah.
It's cool.
No worries.
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"
Your stupid secret always comes first.
-What?
-I said no worries.
You ready to go?
"Yeah, right."
"Come, let's sleep."
"No, I'll not come."
"Come Prakash, it'll be warm."
"You mean, are you that type?"
Yuck!
Our 'friendship' is broken.
Oh broken!
"What type are you, man?"
My patient likes to undress himself and I like to undress others.
Don't you wear brief?
Door is locked!
How come I got stuck here?
"Prakash, come."
Your cheeks are like sausages.
Bommali!
I'll not leave you.
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me!
Mother!
Did you show him stars?
"I didn't show him anything, in fact he showed me everything."
They are not ordinary people.
What happened?
Asking me what had happened?
One sleeps without any clothes and another doesn't like others wearing clothes.
"I beg you dear, please shift me from that room."
- Why?
They are other 'type' of people.
Yuck!
What the hell are you saying?
"Stay with them for a night, you'll know it."
He's a sex maniac!
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
I can't see anything.
It must be catching.
Don't tell me you're going blind and all!
Sometimes if you bring your top down and waggle the bottom.
"Who do you think I am, Gypsy Rose Lee?"
Oh!
"Hey, it works."
"It's gone, Granville!"
"Oh, it's gone."
What a relief!
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"Now, what can we give this young man to show our appreciation?"
-
- Give?
-
- You don't have to give me anything.
-
- You'd do the same for me.
-
"- Too proud to accept charity, Granville."
"Well, put it this way."
What bargains can we put him onto to show our appreciation?
"Th--There we are, sir."
-
- Compliments of the management.
-
- You've been very good.
There's someone up there that sees everything we do.
"I know, I know."
It's that Mrs Harris -
- I saw her peering out of her bedroom window.
'Ey up.
He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
You see this button?
She controls her own dosage.
"Friends, family, career, future..."
None of these things matter to her now.
This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction.
Satisfied?
$25 million.
$30 million. $35 million.
"Ladies, you're off my grid."
I've lost visual of you.
You were right.
It is a cabal of evil florists.
We found Finch's flower patch.
If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse...
We can wipe out every damn flower in here.
Go get Amanda.
I got this covered.
Got it.
"Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead."
I'll lead you in.
Something's wrong.
I'm losing power.
Who the hell are you?
No sign of Amanda.
Abby?
Eve?
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around!
The last offer I heard was $35 million.
Who wants to get real?
$50 million.
"If it was true, everybody'd be looking for somebody to run down."
"You didn't believe us, did ya?"
No.
Course not.
You know what?
Maybe it wasn't him what let that mouse out.

Ok.
Step together.

"Right, left, and turn!"
And pose.
I know what you're doing.
What?
Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?
Listening to a little live music?
"Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't..."
Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?
- Great show.
- You were awesome!
"It was amazing, really."
But we have to go.
We do?
We do.
"Good job, man."
- What'd you think?
- It was really good.
"Come on, you're a musician."
You actually know what you're talking about.
- Bring it.
- Uh... ok.
"Um, your energy was really good."
"The songs are good, but, um, I don't know."
"I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess."
I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.
You guys used to play together?
- Hide me.
- What?
How?
Rick Castle.
"Oh, hi, Courtney."
Hey.
I'm Courtney.
Hayley.
"So, what's going on?"
You guys have a beef or something?
- Me and Rick?
- Yeah.
No.
No way.
We're buds.
- Oh.
- Buds?
"Last time I saw you, you tried to run me down with a golf cart 'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie."
"But what I didn't know then, which I do now, was that your movie was gonna be quite possibly the worst movie ever made."
Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have happened to my career.
[Sighs]
So thanks.
Let's do lunch some time.
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
Say hi to Brandon.
Can you believe her?
Worst movie ever made?
"Yeah, I can believe her."
It was a terrible film.
"Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive."
What the hell was his name?
"Look, since we're not gonna partner..."
... thatclearstheway for us to get together socially.
"You really don't get this, do you, Roy?"
Listen to what I'm saying.
I don't wanna have anything to do with you.
SlPOWlCZ:
"Hey, Laura."
-Hey.
KELLY:
Hey.
"-Hey, John."
-How's it going?
-Good.
Could you do me a favor?
-Sure.
-On the Garcia homicide...
... couldyougetstatements on the husband and wife?
-l thought I put three in there.
-You did.
You got three documents of spousal abuse.
A woman confesses...
... shestabbedherhusbandafter he beat her.
Why more statements?
Something isn't right.
Her lawyer's ready to plead manslaughter two.
That's the worst she'd do.
Something's missing.
I don't agree.
"Before the trial, I'll reinterview like I do on every case."
-l don't think there'll be a trial.
-Tell your boss you want to go to bat.
I think he'll deal anyway.
"Girls, I'll meet you outside."
Get her.
Okay.
"Just the littlest bit snug, aren't they?"
There we go.
"Cute, though, huh?"
How much?
- 700.
- 700?
"Yes, well, I'll tell you what."
You pay for quality 'cause there's so much crap out there these days.
"Man, I am excited to bust my dogs out in these tonight."
We're going to a French restaurant...
Le Bistro.
"It's five stars, so..."
I don't know if you've been to it.
"That sounds great, but this has been declined."
Declined?
You're kidding me!
Oh!
Makes me so mad.
"Like, the credit card companies..."
the way they waste your time.
Probably protecting me.
I spent a lot of money today.
Try that one.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Did it not go through?
What motive could a man possibly have for pooping where he sleeps?

"Hello, partner."
'Thanks.
I'll wait out here.'
Would you mind passing me out a chair?
Hello.
Will you tell the manager that one of those fresh college boys is annoying me?
I'm the manager.
Get away from that door!
And you wouldn't consider this an emergency?
"Just give us 2 hours, and the notebook will be recovered by then."
Perhaps less than two hours.
Just one and a half.
"- Give me Academician Filip, please."
- Is it OK?
Filip speaking.
"Following a thorough evaluation of the situation the crew of the Adam 84 Expedition has decided, that..."
This is CWB.
This is the Central World Brain.
The connection is lost.
CWB is powerless in the matter.
"Well, what do you say?"
Where did she go now?
Eh?
Poochie!
Stupid Bernau!
Give it to him!
Are you scared?
You'll get some more tomorrow at school!
Just wait!
"What've they done to you, Adam?"
"Oh, it's just my shirt."
But they couldn't take the notebook from me.
What's so important to them about it?
Secret calculations.
It's not suitable for girls.
- Unless...
- Why are you so secretive?
Perhaps some girls could...
Adam!
Stop messing about!
It's over.
Then why are you here?
This is not my wife.
This is Trudy.
I met her a couple weeks ago.
Can we go boogie boarding now?
"And once people knew what we were going through,"
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof.
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly.
"I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel."
Just tell her how you feel.
"Well, I think if you looked at everything that..."
"No, no, no, no."
Just...
Don't explain intellectually how you feel.
"You know, just tell her how you feel."
In one word.
Sure.
Angry.
Cynthia?
Judged.
Very good.
Yes?
Progress.
Excited.
Relieved.
That is it.
Yeah.
We're awesome at feelings!
Okay.
"Nice job today, guys."
That's all for today?
It's true!
- Skinny dudes...
- My sister married down.
Seriously.
"Oh, ""married down""?"
We were just having this conversation.
"""Married down""?"
"No, chunky is like marrying...sideways!"
"[ Laughing ] ""Sideways."""
Ferrara:
"Like, ""drag race"" to me means something totally different to you guys, I'm guessing."
It's true.
"And I'm guessing ""tranny"" means something different to me than it does to you."
"What does ""tranny"" mean to you?"
"""Tranny"" means the transmission."
Really?
I think we need to get you a drag name.
"Oh, no."
You're in San Francisco.
"I mean, everybody has a drag name here."
Ready?
Wait.
We're naming her miss Tess Tosterone.
"""Miss Tess tosterone."""
You know what?
That's pretty funny.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
I really...
I got so many other calls.
"I really can't, but you guys have been great."
"Yeah, whatever."
[sighs]
But look at me now.
"Mom, lie down for a while."
The Sergeant will come back later.
I just remembered something.
"That's more like it, Mrs. Slocum."
I sent my black taffeta to the cleaners... and it's never gonna be back in time for that meeting at the women's club.
[sighs]
I'll be back.
"Really, Sergeant."
My mother's a wonderful woman.
She just suffers from overacting.
That's the understatement of the year.
"Oh, mercy."
You must be that detective.
"Say, I got a few ideas about that murder."
I'll bet you have.
[scoffs]
Well.
"Where's your mother, honey?"
"Mrs. Armstedder, take it easy."
She's really had a rough day.
"There you are, Lottie."
"Boy, do you look a mess."
"Well, come on, honey, refreshments."
We got a lot of talking to do.
Now.
Oh.
Move over.
Isn't this exciting?
Look at that.

Yes.

- See you.

Don't interrupt me!
I'm fed up with it!
I got interested.
"I started gathering information about Garik, his family and work."
I found some data.
Come and look.
He's gone.
He died the next year after your graduation.
He died almost 30 years ago.
Your best friend died.
You could have invented something more convincing and not use such cruel lie.
I'm leaving.
I can't live like this any longer.
I'm so scared with you!
- Hello?
- Hello?
"Hi, old man!"
Garik!
Is that you?
It's me.

- What?
Who is dead?
Are you drunk again?
You're dead.

I'm thinking of you.
And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you.
Can't you still?
Did you realize that it's not the same now?
We don't love each other anymore.
That's what the letter said?
Nothing else?
Did it say something about me?
Yes.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Can't you say those things about me?
You've never wanted to know them.
Well now I do.
What do they matter now?
!
To me they do!
Tell me!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Then tell me!
You're nuts!
That's what you think about me?
No.
That would be so easy!
"Besides, you'd take that as a compliment!"
I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you like to live in the countryside?
Always.
I'd stay here.
I couldn't get used to it.

"- Shit, this isn't good."
- This is not good.
This is not good.

No.
No.

- Fucking shit.
Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.

- You saw it yourself?

I don't have much time.
I prefer to draw.
You're wrong.
I preferred your paintings.
Will you show them to me?
I'd rather not.
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.

"Duchess, I've only just arrived."
Thank God I was in time to defend Madame Sand's honour.
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
"- Wait, do--"
"If anyone comes in, just act like you're working or something."
"Wait, mike."
"Mikey, where are you?"
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Get over here, will you?"
I got too many irons.
"Go right over there, give the ceiling a pull, will you?"
Basic business principles went right down the drain on this thing.

If Chowsky won't rehearse you today
I shall have him discharged.
[whistling]
Can't you see I'm busy?
The Judge wants to talk to you.
That was a board decision about an entire department.
Griff is one person who slipped.
- We're calling it a slip?
- Work is structure.
"It's a support system, Frank."
"- Employees, when they stumble, desperately need..."
"- Oh, now it's a stumble?"
I'm not running a rehab program.
"Relapse is inevitable, if that's what happened."
"Oh, that's what happened."
"Griff had one, two bad weeks."
"Before then, a year where he wasn't a problem."
"Hey, I warned him, Allen!"
Think about the stress that he was under
"- the explosion, the suicide..."
- It's still no.
- He just needs another chance.
"- Allen, stop!"
It's no.
One for the road?
- You hungry?
- I could eat.
I heard you got fired.
Yeah?
"Whatever,"
"I couldn't stand it there, to be honest."
Yeah.
My whole family works there.
- Nightmare.
- Total nightmare.
To freedom.
"So you and Zoe, huh?"
- This thing is kinda peppy.
You got a turbo on this thing?
You fellas spread out.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
I want you guys to check down here.
I've noticed a lot of foot traffic down these stairs tonight.
Foot traffic?
There's been no foot traffic.

It's like a... a literacy thing.
A literacy thing?
"Yes, many of these poor boys have trouble reading."
"Nice work, Beaver."
I can read.
You're doing a great job.
The ZBZ sisters have been helping them learn a little.
"Secret philantropy, if you will."
Stop!
It's none of your business!
You'll get hurt!
I told you!
You'll get hurt.
You traitors mixed the two factions.
"No, we haven't."
"Actually, they're the same style."
"Yes, you just haven't realized it."
Kung-fu is no fixed motion!
It's endless!
Go!
Stop!
Stand back!
They're geniuses to have mixed the two factions.
I must kill the two traitors!
"Brother, they set a good example."
We shouldn't kill them.
Fung-wu's master and Jun-kit's sister were killed by us so that we could learn their styles.
"They taught us, so they're our masters now."
Release them!
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
- He's a monk now!

"Yan-ling, behave like a girl!"
"Master, I wish to go to the restaurant with you."
Go then!
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
What did you say?
Vomit!
I am telling you to turn down the car.
Which one?
This one or that one?
"I am sick of his question answers,"
How are you?
"Give me two batteries, Which ones, Big, Medium or small?"
Remote batteries?
Which remote batteries?
"VCD, DVD or TV, To explode a bomb remote's battery."
Khade chand!
Yes!
Madam!
"Did you hear, what I hear?"
"I've seen it photo, today this diamond is mine, Papa"

You humiliated me in the car!
You've humiliated me a lot.
You humiliated me in front of these girls!

You are beating me in front of everybody.
What can I do if the battery is not functioning!
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, Mallefille."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
Help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'll kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.

Bastard!
- You got it.
We picked up a paramedic call.
What happened?
- He saved my brother.
He's a doctor.
"- Here, let's roll on this."
We're at the scene of an incredible rescue.
It appears that a doctor has saved a little boy from drowning.
"We got it, doc."
Call Mercy.
- Mercy's not a Level 1trauma center.
- It's the nearest treatment facility.
This boy needs a surgeon.
Probably an ICU.
We gotta follow station protocol.
- What's your transport time?
"- In this weather, maybe 12 minutes."
- Where's your pilot?
"- Hey, Jimmy!"
Over here!
"- Sorry, doc."
We got to move.
"- Wait, wait."
We're losing time.
- What's your flight time to County ER?
-15 minutes.
- Will you take us?
- We're not medically equipped.
"- He's hypothermic, needs special care."
- Mercy is closer.
- Then he dies because there's no ICU.
- Or else he dies in a news chopper.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
"Oh, it's you."
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm supposed to command a ""human"" team."
"Even if you aren't human anymore, do you still crave a man at night?"
Has the new commander arrived at his post?
We transferred him from SAS.
He seems capable.
"May God and Her Majesty, the Queen, bless you."
- Amen.
- Amen.
"Walter, what is this about?"
"You've made Hamchunk's ""A"" Club."
You funny!
You not.
This is Hamchunk.
He's become a permanent fixture here.
He's an orphan.
Lived with some missionaries about 10 clicks south of here till they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.
You number one.
I choose you.
I don't want to be chosen.
- I don't think you have much choice.
"- Choice, Mr. Hobson?"
I haven't had a choice since I was selected for this outfit.
I don't know lt was a kind of illness
Even when he was a child?
- Was he unhappy?
- Yes
"When he died, did he know I was going to be born?"
Yes
Do you think it was my fault?
I know it wasn't
Come here
He was very happy when he heard I was pregnant lf he comes back can we ask him why he died?
"Yes, maybe"
Come with me
- Anyone here?

This place looks like a bomb site

This morning the bastards took all my food
- And since you're doing nothing...
"- Yeah, OK"
- Were there many of them?
- l don't know
Have you ever seen him?
I didn't see anyone
Does he look familiar?
He looks like Toni's brother
Do you know him?
Sort of.
He's a nutter
He used to live above the dam
But I mean that was ten years ago
- Thanks
- Stop by the station
"Addons When the plane will collapse and headquarters of the ""all2gethr. com""."
Addons We will die all know ... together with who was in the building.

The joke is over now.
Addons
- Must ...
"- Conversely, Dave"
Addons I started a joke now!
Addons Are we having fun yet?
.
"- Max, please, listen ..."
- Leave me alone ..
Please!
Do not harm my child.
Addons
- What happened to him?
- No one can save you now.
Addons But you have the opportunity to let you rescue his daughter.
Discussions Addons failed ...
Your daughter will die Sunday.
Failure Addons and then will die.
Addons Finalize your tasks and they will live.

Please know that I can not tell you.
-Think so?
-What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"-He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about two years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to 20.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me...

My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step. lt's slippery.
Thank you.
-How long?
-About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
-Try that diner over there.
You didn't go.
-You did the right thing.
"-No, I didn't!"
He had no business there without a ghost.
That should have been me plus backups.
But Eddie was such a hothead... .
I mean...
... thekindthatnevercoolsoff.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
This one...
"... itsetTinoupforthemax, 1 0 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer... .
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State parole officer.
Better pay and pension.
-Nicer surroundings.
Go.
Move.
Come on.
They went this way.
You sure?
"Birds fly away from danger, predators."
Dawkins is making a fast pace.
"He's snapping branches, he's kicking rocks."
"The Apapanes didn't like it, one of them sounded the alarm call, off they went."
Down here.
Come on.
"Please, can we stop and have some water real quick?"
All right.
One sip and then we go.
"Come on, come on, come on."
They stopped here.
"No, don't do that."
Molokai's rainforest's got pathogenic microbes in the water that'll put a man down in an hour.
"Judging from those tracks you found, looks like they drank from it."
They won't get much further.
"Come on, Tarzan, now we got an advantage."
Who told you to stop?
"- Please, something's wrong."
"Come on, move."
- We don't feel...
- Move.
Move.
I can't get a clear shot.
Dawkins.
Come on.
Come on.
Move.
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.

It's everything that we hoped it would be.

- The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"- Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
- I'm sorry.
"Dr. Cairn says it's a part of the healing process, the side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"- Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Who are you?
I'm Edith.

- In what?
In the bucket!
"Well, it sure is heavy."
That was my shot foot you dragged me in here with!
- You gonna die on me?
- No.
- You still shoot?
- Yes!
"Friend, you wouldn't shoot me in the back?"
"Friend, if I was gonna shoot you, it wouldn't be in the back."
"Cover, please."
Just tell him to put that down on the floor.
That weapon gives him adult status.
Tommy... put it down.
Please.
"You hurt my sister, I'll kill you."
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.
- The manager is expecting me.
"- One moment, please."
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES
It's this suitcase.
- Shall I open it?
"- Yes, open it."
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.
What problem?
Something weird with a very young girl.
I think that's why he vanished all of a sudden.
Poof and he was gone.
"Rovira Galvez, Sebastian."
Sexual assault on a minor?
Whereabouts unknown...
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...
Anything else?
Any friends who know him?
"No, he has no family."
Nobody in his town ever saw him again.
He didn't even go to his mother's funeral.
"Yeah, yeah."
Thank you very much.
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!
You should know we're going through rough times.
Mr. Alfonso is offering 20% more than last year.
- 150 pesetas more per day.
- That's nothing!

Goku's friends are all gathered
Vegeta is training so he does not come?

And Son-kun too?

Bills is on his way to North Kaio planet.
To see Goku seeking a Super Saiyan God.
the so-called Super Saiyan God..
Aim for the Dragon Balls!
Pilaf Gang's great strategy!
Now I remember ...
- No.
- Not you either?
Willy Kos... no.
I've never heard of that name.
Why?
Because she had his passport with her.
Stained with blood..
And forged.
You know nothing about this?
"No, how would I know with whom this crazy woman has associated with."
"I let her work with me out of pure compassion and good-heartedness upon her arrival from the East Zone, and for that I'm now interrogated!"
Hold on.
Bring the woman in here!
There's a possibility she might remember you.
- But what if she is dangerous?
"- What could she possibly do to you, Anna?"
"Don't worry, she's complety harmless."
My God.
She really is crazy.
Pauline.
Mrs John.
"Pauline, oh my goodness."
What has Bruno done to you?
Bruno?
Bruno!
BRUNO!
What is it?
Let me go!
Everything is like it should be.
"See, she really is insane!"
"So you recognize me, right?"
Did you beat me?
He was here just now!
You'll be dead if I catch you
This is such a small place
Where can he hide?
I'm here!
"You bastard, you bastard!"
I'm so mad!
"Gao, how come you're so slow?"
I'm coming!
Coming!
You will have it for sure
"Y es, I'll be right there!"
"Gentlemen, take your time!"
Coming!
That way please!
"Gentlemen, have some tea"
What would you like?
"Whatever is good here, we'll take it!"
"Y es, yes, will be right here!"
Hurry up!
Just get whatever dishes here
"Anyway, we can eat as much as we want"
When we get to the home of Thunderstorm!
What're you rushing at?
Brother Y an is really smart
He can turn the home of Thunderstorm ...to be his own camp
What about Shi Zhengzong?
That coward
Of course he won't dare to fight back!
"Come, a toast!"
What happened?
You messed up again!
"Oh, fun."
Unless you don't want me to go.
Are you asking my permission?
"No,"
- you-you just seem like you...
"- No, no."
Go.
Have fun.
Enjoy yourself.
Okay.
Good.
- Good.
- Good.
"Look, take a break from work later, come visit me."
You gotta eat.
Maybe I will.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Dad, Scott brought these sandwiches over as a little peace offering."
"You know, for screwing up your deal."
Wasn't that nice?
"Well, let's see..."
Sandwiches... millions of dollars.
"Sandwiches, millions of dollars..."
He also brought pickles.
"Our biggest client just fired us because that deal fell through, thanks to this idiot."
"Hey, you know, there's no need for name calling."
"This is my place of business, pal."
I can call you Roberta if I want to.
- What the hell is that?
- My cell phone.
Listen to that.
Even his phone ring pisses me off.
Right?
You look great!
Really great!
You think so?
Sure!
Anything else?
The family is falling apart  right in front of my eyes.
He's only going on vacation.
Yes I know.
"But for me, vacations always took years."
Oh god!
"I'm getting cold, kids."
Here he comes.
"Well, there will always be a place for you here."
"At least, as long as I'm here."
"Hey, I've heard someone wants a ride."
"What's all this here, god damn it!"
?
Your theory was right.
Those were kids from the tattoo shop.
What?
You want to know what I think?
No!
A suspect is fleeing over there.
And you're having a relationship with the other suspect.
Is it clear what you're doing here?
"No, cancel the whole operation!"
"Conflict of interest, aiding and abetting, disciplinary action."
Are you stupid!
?
"Franz, man!"
- They sure can sing.
TREVILLE:
"What is so urgent, it couldn't..."
Did you write that?
No.
I'll get the cadets ready to leave.
"That message is a forgery, designed to lure Aramis,"
Porthos and d'Artagnan into an ambush.
Who did this?
Grimaud.
You saw him with Feron?
Were they in deep conversation?
It certainly looked like it.
An alliance with Feron puts the Red Guard at Grimaud's disposal.
- Sir?
- Saddle up.
(COUGHING)
"My clothes, bring me my clothes."
(LOUIS SCOFFS)
"When I said ordinary, I didn't mean ugly."
"We can alter them again, Your Majesty."
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
"No, it's too late now, this will have to do."
"Louis, why don't I accompany you?"
I know how difficult today must be for you.
Anniversary of your father's death.
I've already arranged an escort.
Thank you.
"Now, where is my money?"
D'ARTAGNAN:
"Hold, hold, hold!"
(HORSES GALLOPING)
Do you hear that?
Well...
We won't give up.
We'll just keep looking.
"Today, tomorrow..."
"Oh, not tomorrow."
The race is tomorrow.
"Well, Roger's more important than the race."
"Oh, Thomas, you know, I get this feeling down deep in my solar plexus... that if you really try..."
I mean really try real hard... you can win this race.
"And if you win, everything will be okay for Roger and me."
"I mean, the police will find him and... and he'll give back the money and we'll get married."
You know what I mean?
"Yeah, I know."
Beauty Knows No Pain.
Yeah.
?
Beyond the reef?
?
Where the sea is dark and cold?
?
My love has gone?
?
And our dreams grow old?
?
Someday I'll know?
?
She'll come back?
"Remember, this is your best event."
So don't go saving your energy for the other events.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't forget.
"Moroni, stop it or I will make you regret it."
"Italia,"
You do not understand it that it makes time that I wait for each moment?
-Moroni...
-And now that we are alone...
"Moroni, be carefull..."
"Italy, I wish you, you the very many desire."
"Moroni, the request, does not do that."
"But, how you dare?"
Beauty that I...
"No, you do not have to beat to me because I am terrible..."
"Moroni, have I hurt you?"
Moroni?
Moroni?
Have i hurt you?
Moroni?
Little baby?
Little baby?
Little baby.
Call me Ben.
Idiot!
"-Eh, boys, you come here."
-You arrive behind schedule.
-Italia is done...
-What said to you?
The next time we will also do the Italians.
You speak like a politician.
"Alvaro, if your parents speak with mine, we are of excursion?"
in agreement?
"Yes, we are all in Honolulu."
You do not worry.
The suntan oil!
They looted the jewels...
- What?
!
I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
"Sadhana, please."
I did ask you.
"If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away."
"You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her."
"You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?"
"Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?"
"Mom, ask her to keep quiet."
Why should I stay quiet?
"Sadhana, be calm."
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.
"I'm sorry, aunt."
I don't want this wedding.
- Sadhana!
"Mom, let's go."
'Who?
What?
When?
'
'Swathi was hanging out with her friends'.
'2 twilight thieves arrested.'
Sadhana.
Sadhana.
What do you do all day?
Not much.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Is your mother back?
Not yet.
Is that your own money?
No.
- Does your mother approve?
- Sure.
She always gives a lot herself.
We don't want any trouble.
You realize ...
Normally we don't take money from children.
That's a lot of money.
"No, we can do it."
"Well, take a good look at how beautiful this house is."
They can afford it.
"As thanks for the donation, I have here a plaster."
Help!
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Please prove that you're our mother.
Ask her what my favorite song is.
What is Lukas' favorite song?
"""Good evening, good night""?"
Don't!
"Can you count the stars, shining in the night sky?"
"Can you count the clouds, hovering over the fields?"
Oh Lord watch over them.
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
"I'm doing this for all of us, mom."
Hi!
"No, thanks."
Are you also the pride of yourparents?
"Just like me, you're not sure."
"My fatherwas a soldier, I always wanted to be like him."
He used to say:
"""I am so proud of you, son""."
Attention!
"Combat boots on, guns ready, attack!"
One afterthe other...
They all die...
Dad would be so proud of me.
At ease!
"At ease, huh?"
Dad is dead.
My condolences.
We owe our lives to dad.
I owe everything to him.
"Soldiers are immortal, nations are indivisible."
"You'll fucking serve the army too, you pussy boy Can!"
Pussy boy!
We should leave now.
These hands were so tiny.
Size of a cat's paw.
They said you wouldn't live.
So tiny.
Now look at these...
Why don't you join a support group forfallen officers' families?
You're always at home.
It's not that.
It's the seaside I miss.
Max?
Do not touch anything.
- He will be seen.
- Why does not this display?
Please do not touch anything.
Stop it.
Please tell ...
Please leave.
I think this is display the information.
It will take us where is electricity.
We do not have to do this.
I have it.
Caught.
What the heck?
We're not going to New York.
What?
Where do we go?
Norway?
We're going to Oslo.
What is it?
Why are they doing this?
- I do not think that should be done.
- What did you say?
It can not be them.
What do you think of everything that is legal?
- Did you talk with co pilot?
- This is a competition!
Do you think that the network Social killing people?
I have to go to pilot.
There are people dying because we are breaking the rules.
We will follow the game no one else was hurt.
They can not kill everyone.
Madame Sand!
"Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!"
"delighted to meet you, Baroness."
"I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz."
"He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in."
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes.
We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes.
- But she's ill now.
- How sad.
And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet!
(Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
"- Do you pray, Baroness?"
"- If you must know, I'm secretly devout."
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
"well, no."
There... is the answer.
The culprit is...
Jacques Dollon.
Jacques...
"It is not possible, this man is dead."
Where's the gold?
Over there.
Thank you.
"What do you want, Sir?"
"I would like to see Mr Nanteuil, please."
Private business.
Please follow me.
It is Mr Fandor.
Ask him to enter.
"Ah, Mr Fandor."
I did not think I would meet you so fast.
Mr Nanteuil.
Hello.
Sit down.
You're probably not ignoring the excitement caused in Paris by the murder of the Baroness de Vibray.
And the important theft committed against Princess Danidoff.
And how am I concerned?
"The little I know, I learned it by reading your articles in the press, Mr Fandor."
Can you confirm that the Baroness was ruined?
"Well, I do not violate the professional secret by saying"
yes.
She had undergone irretrievable losses.
And Jacques Dollon?
You think he's guilty?
A priori.
From what I've read in the press.
Why?
Do you have any doubts?
I thought you didn't believe him.
You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying?
That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant?
I'd better kill myself now.
Maybe
Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back?
"That makes sense too, doesn't it?"
What did she do?
Vacation.
Just vacation?
She'd show up at my house once a year and rest.
- Did she have someone?
- What?
Did she see someone?
How dare you?
!
"Aunt Rosa, answer us."
We just want to know if Mom had someone.
Before or after Dad.
- Why?
- Because!
Why can't just you tell us?
!
- Why are you shouting?
- Because you annoy me!
"If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything."
Algeria?
What about Algeria?
Did she have someone in Algeria?
Did she go to Algeria?
How?
They wouldn't let an Israeli in.
"Morning, girls."
Someone had a late night.
What time did the cat drag you in?
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
"Molly, you didn't."
What can I say?
Jimmy is very persuasive.
And nimble.
"You got a guy, peggy?"
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
What about mr.
Fancy?
"You know, the guy I've seen around the automat..."
"Nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders."
"Oh, no."
No.
He's just a colleague.
"Good day, ladies."
Early bird and all that.
"Ah, miss carter, please sit."
This will only be a moment.
"In 1925, the great harry houdini"
Performed at this very building.
"Ugh, houdini."
That's never good.
Women stood spellbound and watched
"As he escaped from handcuffs,"
"Straight jackets, steamer trunks."
But the one trick he could not pull off
Was ascending the stairs.
"It's a simple rule, ladies."
No men above the first floor.
Landlord says she lives alone.
"And it appears that Pamela or JMJ or whoever, has a predilection for white cotton gloves."
He saw white cotton gloves?
Through her bathroom window.
12 pairs hanging on clothes pegs from her shower curtain.
It's her!
She's the killer!
She's the killer!
Yeah.
The electronic scratch on those anonymous calls?
She used a device to make her voice sound like a man's.
"Sorry about the interruption, JMJ, it was rude."
My name is Pamela.
Pamela?
Do you have a light?
Hmm.
I'm confused.
Why does the lease to your apartment read JMJ Wilgis?
My lease?
"What do your initials stand for, JMJ?"
Pamela.
It's Pamela.
Then who's JMJ?
"Is she, what, your sister?"
Why does she have 12 pairs of white cotton gloves hanging on her shower curtain?
- Answer me!
- You can't treat me like crap!
- Sit down.
- Go to hell!
- Sit down!
- No!
Sit... down!
"-Either I will go, or go... hopefully."
"It sees, María."
"-Yes, lady."
"And now it studies, that you have the examinations."
"yes, study, study..."
What I am going to study?
"We do something, comes."
"God, what beautiful you are..."
No.
-Why no?
-Because not and point.
If everybody does.
"Stay put, watch the film."
"-Sight, watches what it is doing to him."
-If you knew what you haríía I...
"Only would to see if still worked,"
If I worked or I endorse?
"They call Perennial Dust to me,"
"In addition, after a time between grates,"
"Then all good goes,"
"You remember lnés Badoer, its artistic name, if therefore it is possible to be said, Inés?"
To the attack!
"Alvaro, quiet."
It is possible that you only think about that?
"Yes, Yes."
Only in that.
You already know that I do not want.
"But, if we are engaged."
Indeed.
Ten patience?
no?
"Have I it, she is who does not have it."
Or...
Or maybe you couldjust check it out before Maintenance gets here.
And risk angering a restless spirit?
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
That's not how I roll.
Okay.
Uh...
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Mr. And Mrs. Burke.
We will...
We will send somebody up right away.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
"Oh, and could you tell Maintenance to take a look at the shower door while they're here?"
I got stuck in there this morning.
No problem.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
The shower door?
In the same shower door where Monica was stuck?
In the same bathroom where her ashes were flushed down the toilet?
You really are superstitious?
I just figured fixing a thermostat was beneath you.
Superstitious?
No.
Spiritual?
Yes.
"I grew up in my grandmother's house, Danny."
"And when she died, strange things started happening."
Footsteps when there was no one there.
Light turning on and off.
But this time it's totally about the crying.
So he showed a little emotion.
Girls are supposed to like that.
I do not need the chase.
"Bella,you're a control freak."
You love a project.
"To you,an ambivalent guy is like a poorly organized closet."
I don't...
I don't want ambivalence.
I want to be adored.
Johnny's great.
The guy touches my face.
You know how many face-touching guys are left out there?
I hope it's a similar amount to the number of hand-washing guys.
"Good morning,my love!"
"Dude,just sack up,already."
Geez!
I saw it.
It was fine.
It was cute.
Whatever.
Excuse me.
Gotta go to the office.
Later.
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Were you hanging from it?
Nothing.
I don't know.
It's old.
- You had sex right there.
- Shut up.
- Right where your father is.
Dr. Cairn had it personally adjusted for you.
- Thank you.
- Very good.
Please!
Please don't do this!
Where is Dr. Cairn?
!
"- Dr. Cairn has given you to me, my exquisite... pitiful little creature."
"- I'll do better, I promise."
Please give me a second chance.
"Please, please."
- Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.
This is a special day.
"- No, no, no."
- A celebration.
"- No, no, no."
- In your honour.
- No.
"Life is changed, not taken away."
Bodies grow slowly and die quickly.
- How have your dreams been of late?
"- After my parents' passing,"
I had the most frightful nightmares.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now... my dreams are different.
- Different how?
"Isabel, we spoke about this last week."
"Without complete honesty, the healing cannot take place."
"- Yes, sir."
"Lately, my dreams have been... strange."
"They feel so real, I hardly know where the dream ends and reality begins."
- No.
Someone has to look after the injured.
We can't take them with us.
- All right.
"- Thank you, Mariá."
I have a question.
"Do you love this country, your homeland?"
"Yes, señor."
Have you explained that we're fighting this war for them?
"Yes, I have, señor."
So why are they staring at me as if I was a venomous snake?
They're just watching you eat because they're not going to get any food today.
Commandante!
Commandante!
What's the matter?
I've intercepted a radio message.
It wasn't even encoded.
They're going north.
So are Silveira and his militia.
- And they've requested helicopters.
- We're leaving right now.
- Get ready.
We're leaving.
- Mariá will take you to San Juan.
Helicopters!
"Oh, my God!"
"Into the jungle, everybody!"
Hurry up!
Take cover!
The helicopters are coming!
Hurry up!
Get into the jungle!
There's no time.
"Gemma, run, please, go!"
Fuck.
She could... s-she could've cut us free.
"Tools, weapons."
We-we could have fought.
We could have run away.
"You can't run anywhere, babe."
"You did well, Luke."
You showed guts.
"Oh, you keep it."
You're in the family now.
I trust you with it.
- What if someone finds out?
"- Trust me, Luke."
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over... we can just disappear.
Lie low while my father's people deal with these loose ends.
Your father knows about this?
This whole business has shamed him more than anyone else.
My duty was clear.
Restore family honour by any means necessary.
- What?
- I knew he had my back.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
"Did you send the postcard, El?"
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad we got that cleared up.
This is the last leg.
You're almost there.
- Stand still!
- Get out.
All right.
No one will come in here.
Stay on the door.
The Frenchman.
What'd he say?
It's about us being revolutionaries like him.
The captain wants to see me about him now.
Got the petition?
Take care of him.
"We are revolutionaries, but they do things properly."
The French with the guillotine!
"We've had this ship, and Scott-Padget's still alive!"
Wait.
You can go now.
Come in.
"You wish to see me, sir?"
- Mr. Crawford?
- Sit down.
Where are we heading?
"Oh, my committee aren't decided yet."
"Caribbean, South America..."
Anywhere but England.
It's of England I wish to speak to you.
Colonel Giraud has vital information about an intended invasion.
- That's the truth.
- Invasion?
We got the landing places and the approximate date out of him.
But he knows a great deal more.
He must be handed over for questioning at once.
Handed over?
I wanted...
I wanted to do something that used the part of my brain that was healthy.
"So, what's different now?"
I know how the world sees me.
And people with schizophrenia aren't lawyers.
They're bag ladies.
So prove them wrong.
Finish law school.
You have insight into something very few people understand.
Think about this.
"If you finish law school, who could you help?"
"Their distinct color comes from their main food source, shrimp."
Not far away from our flamingo friends...
Cat.
Bat.
Rat-a-tat-tat.
- Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
- Heh.
Right?
Right.
You're so lucky.
Your voices... stop sometimes.
Times.
Crimes.
Limes.
Times.
I have a secret.
It's about my mother.
There was the one I told my friends about... the mom I wished I had.
She mostly lives in my snow globe.
Then there was Up Mom.
You see what I'm talking about?
"- Take him forward, put him under guard."
- Jones.
Another flogging.
Pass the word:
We do a full tryout tomorrow at eight bells.
First Lieutenant said keep a sharp lookout to starboard.
"You men on gun three, jump to it!"
Station two marines in the after well deck at six bells.
- Steer east-nor'east.
"- Aye, aye."
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
"- Yes, sir."
- Have you noticed anything?
"- Noticed what, sir?"
A number of small things.
Like a man shouting without a sound.
"- I don't know what you mean, sir."
- All right.
He saw you do it.
- Why did you?
- That's the signal.
Three cheers.
"- Next time, be careful."
- When are we gonna do it?
- The real thing?
- You'll be told.
We did what we said.
We join the fleet in Corsica with something to show.
A fully-pledged ship.
Ready for action.
Not a single bloody ship.
Nothing in the harbor.
You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
- You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- It's going to better use there.
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-We help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"- Paige, you started lying to us."
- I didn't lie.
"- Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
- Do you?
- Lie...
Lying...
- Stop!
What are you doing?
You go behind our backs.
Why?
Does this book tell you to do that?
- Philip.
- Does it?
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"

What happened last night...
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
"So, why don't you stay the hell away from them?"
(grunting)
Ow!
You're gonna bust my arm. (yells)
"Look, I'm not warning you again."
You hear me?
You stay away from them.

Three priors for burglary.
"Your tech specialist, Nathan St. Clair, served time for hacking a DoD server, and two mechanics, you and Ansel Dane, also have priors."
PRIDE:
Half your team's got a record.
"Plus, we know Warbury Racing competed in four cities where four robberies took place."
Mm...
That don't mean nothing.
(chuckles) Come on.
Connors.
Why do you keep protecting the people responsible for your son's murder?
What kind of father does that?
Y-You don't understand.
Try us.
Is this about Dana?
Is that it?
Jared loved her more than anything.
"And she loved him, too."
My Adela said it was good luck.
I have something to show you.
Did you notice anything strange before she left?
- My granddaughter was very sad when Quini left her.
- Quini?
"Quini, from Villa-Franco."
The good-looking one.
She didn't say where she was going?
To find work.
She said she'd come back for us after.
These books are hers.
She was going to night school to get her diploma.
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?
"Okay, okay!"
"You, stay put."
- Did you know Carmen and Estrella?
- Everyone did.
What was your relationship?
You already know.
I dated Carmen for a couple months.
"- A little young, no?"
- Young for what?
- Did you take photos of her?
- Do I look like a photographer?
Want me to hit you again?
Where were you the night they disappeared?
"September 17th, six days ago."
Yes.
Has this ever happened before?
No.
You've answered your own question.
But what if this 'Happily ever after'... becomes 'Happy never after' after some time?
You are right.
And you have a great track record too.
What if you get bored?
You are no Ms. Virtuous either.
Correct.
"Okay so the issue is, how do we trust each other?"
"So the issue is, is this feeling enough?"
- No..
- Then..
"The issue is, do we get this feeling with someone else or not."
Oh...
It's like a buffet out here.
So find some new fancy dish for yourself..
..and I'll find someone for myself.
And we'll know.
Hold on.

- What are you doing?
This is too risky.

I'm leaving.
The things I've to do for her.

That was a big mistake.
"Area one, clear!"
"Area three, clear."

Is there any news on Richard yet?
"Well, he wasn't at the flat."
We've done our bit.
You've certainly done yours.
You all right?
He'll run.
Start afresh.
They've sent out an alert to all airports and stations.
But what if he's already gone?
Hello?
What?
Fantastic.
"OK, just hold on, would you?"
Someone matching the description of Richard Henderson boarded the Eurostar to Brussels.
The police picked him up at Ashford.
They've got him!
I've been tying to work out what I did wrong.
"Come on, it's killing me, what was it?"
Something I said or...
It was something you touched.
The picture.
Caught out by Jesus!
How irritating!
Irritating?
Is that your summary of what's happened?
"Oh, please, don't expect me to express guilt."
Come on!
You killed those people.
Why?
I talked with Eva.
- You saw her?
She asked me to tell you that you were not responsible.
She would have broken down anyway.
She hated being a prostitute.
even a medical one.
You were just a catalyzer.
It's not your fault.
You're lying.
- Excuse me?
She would never have said that.
It's not true.
Globale told you to calm me down.
You're totally paranoiac.
I must find her.
Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes.
I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you.
So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look.
We all want you to get better.
to go outside.
But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?

- Pardon?
-
- It's not so loud.
-
- I can't hear you for that shirt.
The milk woman loves it.
Don't change the subject.
We're talking about shirts.
We've got an empty shop here.
"Come on, you're supposed to be outside getting customers in."
Smarten yourself up.
What's the point?
I'll only make a fool of myself.
Then make a smartly--dressed fool of yourself.
-
- Call this smartly--dressed?
-
- It's style for an apprentice shopkeeper.
I know.

Bring 'em back alive.
I'll hold your parachute.
"What are you doing, charging into people that way?"
-
- You can stop people's breath that way!

- Ow!
Why do not you make yourself room.
I'm exhausted.
No heart!
DEATH ...
Book of death?
How to use it .
This is English.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
This works if has the face of the person in mind.
This is ineffective on people of the same name and surname.
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds for that to happen.
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause.
Very fun.
Ouch!
I will not let go .
I would have preferred it to disappear
Ridiculous.
- This is his?
- Yes.

What the hell was that?
You transmuted the molecular properties of the rifle.
What does that even mean?
"Okay, let's get out of here."
Kendra's down.
"Rip, we're kind of outnumbered here."
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis is exacerbating the damage that we have already done to the timeline.
- But Kendra...
"- Is alive, thankfully, and we will rescue her in due course."
I hope.
- So this is a spaceship?
"- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space."

"Of course, books."

The Treasure of Atlantis... is knowledge.
There has to be more.
No!
You're destroying the scrolls!
Get away you stupid old fool.
I want treasure.
We gotta go.
But all this knowledge.
We can't let it be destroyed.

You don't want to get up?
We have to get up?
You don't want to?
is there any news?
"News, but not what you think."
But there is something.
She didn't eat the soup sent by Mrs Hatcher and Mrs Terayn.
Meaning what?
Meaning...
Hold the line.
Did you... notice any black smoke?
"What are you, crazy?"
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
"I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically --"
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
Kind of?
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulphur.
Maybe it's not a demon.
"I mean, kids can be vicious."
"Well, I mean, we're already here."
Might as well check out the school.
Right.
The school.
What?
"Truman High, home of the bombers."
What's your point?
I don't know.
"I mean, we went there, like... for a month a million years ago."
- Why are you so jazzed to go back?
- I'm not.
I just think it's worth looking into.
"All right, well, what's our cover?"
FBI?
Homeland Security?
Swedish exchange students?
Don't worry.
I got an idea.
Okay.

I think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood was caused by the ark then the true power of the ark may be the ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
it is unknown territory.
We don't know what will happen.
Fine by me.

Bavorov.
Really?
My wife comes from Netolice.
"That's quite close, across the wood."
D'you think we can make them run?
How dare you doubt our victory!
It looks like my tough training did no good.
I'll show you!
Lock him up!
You won't forget me in a hurry.
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"No, don't, don't!"
Don't!
Don't!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
"Oh, fuck."
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.
It's jumped from zero to 18K in five milliseconds...
I'm sorry.
"The experience was more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper."
I hope you can forgive us.
...allluggageunderthe seat in front of you.
All electronic devices should now be turned off and stowed as they may interfere with the aircraft's navigational and communication...
Mum?
Mum?
I have to call him.
Mum?
Why did Cooper go?
- I...
"- Mom, I'm right here."
I'm...
"- I'm right here, Mum."
- I have to call Cooper.
I have to call and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
A month back...?
Meeting...?
Is your meeting more important than your daughter's marriage?
Cancel that silly meeting.
Keep quiet.
You remember half  forget half.
Ministers meeting...?
"As said, fix the engagement in 2 days time."
Thank you.
Find out when was the Ministers meeting in Malaysia finalised.
Oh God!
My bladder is full.
Hey Halwa...
I can't take this tension.
I don't know how you will behave.
Tell me your next plan.
I'm planning to surrender.
Don't be tensed.
I am not selfish.
I give charity to everyone.
"Once I surrender, I will tell them your name too."
Even you will find some kick.
I'll be back soon.
- What should I do now?
- Run.
You...
You heard me right.
I said that.
Buy the ticket  run away before they lynch you.
You must know why we got separated.
I won't listen to you.
This is very important.
"But the box was to be opened only if the Faction System broke down, which is why it requires someone like you to open it."
You are living proof that the Divergent problem has grown beyond all control.
Do you even hear what you're saying right now?
No one thinks it's your fault that you were born this way.
"Jeanine murdered an entire faction, Caleb."
That faction could no longer be trusted.
She killed our parents.
Our parents brought that on themselves.
What are you talking about?
The box?
It was in their house.
They were the ones hiding it.
All of those lives could have been spared.
Seems we didn't know our parents as well as we thought we did.
(DOOR OPENS)
All right.
Family reunion's over.
It's time to go.
"I got a little surprise for you, Tris."
TRIS:
Four?
Tris!
- Tris!
Tris!
-Four!
Four!
- Tris!
-Four!
Four!
Stop!
Four!
Foufl
- Yeah.
- The end.
And the last.
- Anyone wanna talk about auditioning?
"- Oh, God."
"Oh, yeah."
"Remember, there was that huge to-do about my hair and my makeup and all that stuff on my last audition."
"Remember, Pete?"
Remem...?
Somebody went...
Did you go shopping for clothes?
- I went shopping for clothes.
- You brought options.
- I bought 800...
- That was the first time we met.
- That's right.
- We read together.
"Pete and Kerry Kohansky gave me pointers and really helped me out, you know."
Was this something I shouldn't talk about?
Never mind.
- That was all a lie.
- We should talk about...
Let's rewind and...
"Wait, seriously, should we go redo that?"
"No, it's okay."
"Oh, shit."
"Should we talk about that today is September 24th, 2008?"
- It's one week till the premiere.
- What's today?
"One week from the premiere, today."
- We have one week till the premiere.
- That's exciting.
"Well, you sirs show no patriotism."
Fine english fabrics!
"Fine english fabrics, Mr Biberkopf!"
I'd rather hope so!
I could never fool myself.
Stop tickling me!
I'll have someone pick my rags up later.
Mieze!
Look!
Be astonished!
- You look very fine!
- Look at me!
Clothes make the man!
- Now it's your turn!
- No no no!
Oh come on!
"Business is going well so we can afford decent clothes, can't we?"
- You'll get your money!
Goodbye.
- I hope so.
Goodbye Mr Biberkopf.
2 bottles of sparkling wine!
Where is the party?
- Knew it!
"- Just some ""celebrities""."
"No, I already told you I won't come along."
I'm not dressed accordingly.
It's your choice.
"Guys like us, looking fine."
I'm not gonna let Franz walk all over me.
"Just watch out for him, he might cause trouble for us with his money-spending habit"
He's an amateur!
The aunt is jealous of me!
"You mustn't say that, dear!"
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show we'd have had a video-library!
You're lying!
Stop this nonsense!
"Let me talk to her, sir."
"Well, Kaushi?"
Why did you do that?
"You dare steal here, Kaushalya!"
Impudent woman!
"Dangerous woman, sir!"
She's playing the Bandit Queen!
"You, too?"
Shut up!
"Who else, if not I?"
!
The neighbours won't ask if my house is robbed!
"I ran out of battery, or I'd have shot the night-scene..."
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?
"Call the police, Banwa."
"That's not necessary, sir!"
I'll personally throw her out!
Shameless creature!
You dare bite the hand that feeds!
"Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!"
Yes.
The garden is the ideal place.
Let's go...
"The plate, Banwa..."
Sure.
What`s going on?
Rusty is licking his hand and touching me with it!
tell Rusty to behave himself.
"Rusty, behave yourself!"
Audrey is eating candy and smiling with it stuck all over her teeth!
"Audrey, eat with you mouth closed!"
"No eating in the car, kids!"
"You suck, you know that?"
Retard!
I am trying to concentrate on the road!

BRENNAN:
Oh...
This is blood.
Aldo's?
"We can't be completely sure, there are tests..."
"Look at that, Bones."
Look.
That's the cage.
(Brennan groans)
Cam will want to do blood spatter analysis as soon as possible.
(camera snapping)
Bones.
I need to finish...
"No, look."
Look!
"Booth, that's a bomb!"
BOOTH:
"We got to go, now."
(grunting)
(gasping)
(Brennan groaning)
Crews are still battling the blaze at an abandoned office complex in Anacostia.
"The cause of the fire is undetermined, but fire marshals suspect the strong possibility of arson."
Booth says it was an IED.
"Yeah, but do IEDs usually take this long to burn off?"
HODGINS:
"No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas."
My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.
"It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees."
Which means there won't be much left.
Close to zilch.
"Whoa, Dr. B."
I don't have anymore.
"Otherwise, I would give you another one."
Don't worry about it.
Don't let them get you down!
"They can all go to hell, right?"
"Great, three days of ravioli."
How was your audition?
They expired last year.
Throw them away.
"Nonsense, what else should we cook?"
Are you going to sing for Toni?
"Well, if I survive the ravioli."
Then that'll be your new job?
Right.
Then you won't work here anymore?
You can always visit me.
Would you like that?
I don't care.
"- No Tom, and no ravioli  but for actual money."
... without Tom.
Bon appetit!
"For tonight's special event, it's best to pray  because it's probably dangerous."
- What?
The food has expired!
If that was the only thing?
Same old story.
Amen.
Amen.
- No ravioli?
No thank you.
- No thanks.
"I bet he goes to a restaurant afterwards, and takes Babette with him."
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
- He doesn't know about it?
- No.
- He's my old friend.
- Right.
I need you to help to talk her out of it.
Just like a breast intervention.
How am I supposed to bring this up?
That's okay.
I'll think of something.
You always think of something.
I don't know.
Is everything else good in your life?
- Be honest with me.
- Hmm?
"For the first time in over a quarter of a century, tell me something that's really bugging you."
I have nothing to confide.
You have experienced a lot you have not shared.
"You've mentioned this to me that I don't confide in you,"
- and there's nothing to confide.
- You haven't confided in me
- in your entire life.
- How could you say...
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Uncle Richard!
Look at you from top to bottom.
"What a doll, huh?"
"- Oh, baby."
- Hi.
This is my fake niece Kim.
Larry David.
"OK, Number Two."
Right.
Go!
"OK, Number Three."
"Stand by, Number Three."
Ready.
Go!
Look at mine.
"Oh, the silly, clumsy clot."
"OK, Number Five."
They're not a bad bunch.
I've seen worse.
Gardner!
From now on I'm in business strictly with you.
"Nothing like an old, established firm."
Heavy.
Hm.
How about a drink tonight?
I might be able to manage...
Have a nice trip?
You didn't have to push me.
"No offence, just trying to help."
I don't need that kind of help.
What makes you such a ruddy hero?
It just ain't natural.
If he puts his hands on me again I'll brain him.
How about that drink?
"Thank you, but this firm doesn't mix business with pleasure."
"Gentlemen, we don't know one another very well yet."
This morning you start your training and we can start to find out.
Now for myself.
"Information, I'm a professional soldier."
"Okay, you go on, I'll be right there I go first..."
Okay!
This is the best harvest ever!
"Ah-fang, you devil!"
Stop crashing around!
What're you in such a rush for you idiot?
I'm racing with Master Chang I left that old fellow 80 feet behind!
Eighty feet behind?
Who...who's that?
Somebody's stolen the grapes!
Yes...for the third time already!
Can we still make Night-sweet Premium?
"They really know their stuff, to steal here"
Come!
A thousand coppers a string!
Come!
Crystal grapes!
Real crystal grapes!
A rare chance!
A thousand coppers a string!
"Crystal grapes, come..."
Come on!
Taste them-real crystal grapes!
You can only get them here!
Real crystal grapes
Only here...
Taste them
"Taste them-only 1 ,000 coppers a string!"
"Have a taste, everybody!"
Eight hundred coppers-800 a string!
"Real crystal grapes, 800 a string!"
Six hundred a string!
Enough!
That's enough!
"If he doesn't remember you Joy, It only means... that his lost of memory is centered on the times you were together."
Is that why he can't remember me?
.
How long will this amnesia last?
.
Will he get his memory back?
.
"We can never tell right now, there are instances when the memories come back after a few weeks or months."
"But in some cases, the memory doesn't come back anymore."
But how is that?
I'm his wife.
Treat him like your patient.
I'll be out later.
"Come on, let's go there."
How are you feeling Migs?
.
How are you feeling Migs?
.
Who exactly are you?
.
I'm Joy.
I'm your wife.
I don't remember anything.
There are so many things I can't remember.
Son?
.
"Mom, what's happening?"
.
"Joy, can I talk to Migs for a while?"
.
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
[alarm ringing]
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
I can't get a restart.
Hit the backup system.
It's no-go on backup.
Temperature increasing in the furnace.
- Get that coolant flowing.
- [phone buzzes]
- Furnace control.
- Control?
"You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you?"
- [alarm continues buzzing] - who is this?
"[victor] this is Dr.VictorGannon,"
It's the finest picture I've ever seen.
"They've gone, every single one."
Who have?
- Percy's pack of suitors.
So will he be OK?
- Yes.
The whole thing has disappeared.
Roly's in seventh heaven.
"Morning, Helen."
"Morning, James."
"- (Helen) Morning, Siegfried."
A quiet night?
"Yes, only one call and that was delightful."
I delivered six bouncing Labrador puppies.
"That's right, my boy."
Your friend Mrs Farmer.
"Come on, Nami."
What's wrong?
No!
OK. I understand.
What happens is nothing to do with me!
Nothing whatsoever.
Who could do this?
Is she a porn model?
That can't be allowed.
I'm wondering what I should do as her supervisor.
There's no need for you to take responsibility in this case.
She's just a slut.
Yes.
It can't be tolerated.
Trust is very important in this industry.
Lay her off.
Of course.
"She looked nice, though."
Come with me.
No.
You're working at the department store?
Have you been following me?
What's wrong?
Has something happened to you?
Stop talking as if you're a friend.
Take this umbrella.
You should go home now.
I just wanted to apologize for having followed you like this.
I didn't intend to do anything like that.
Leave me alone.
I've had just about enough of it.
Please be quiet.
"-... noBankExchange."""""
-And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner...
... butweneedBankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy...
... it'spoliticallyexpedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
I'm talking about a 60-story building that'll employ 3000 people.
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George...
... FrankAnselmo'sin there.
Come.
Arrangements for the night is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same room?
You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed.
I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way.
I'm leaving
I'm not joking.
I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There!
You have a fire going
Granted.
You have a great sense of choice
"You couldn't find a better place to spend the night, right?"
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night with me in the stables.
Not in the room
Eat
Wait!
Those beautiful days of childhood.
"50 years later, the Nobel laureate Adam Bernau wrote in Volume One of the Memoirs, page 63, ""I was dreaming about discoveries that could improve the life of the entire human race."""
I'd like to emphasize that I don't agree.
It's pointless.
There is no other way.
Get ready...
We're going.
Helicopter!
Maximum alert!
"This is gonna cost you a lot, pal!"
- Where do you think that car was?
- There.
"I saw it, but then it drove off that way."
And what happened to the hut?
It just collapsed all by itself?
Look!
Rum!
It's worse than that.
It's brandy.
- But I... please...
- We know!
I'm impressed!
"The car only used up 30% energy,"
Instead of the allowed 70%.
Thanks to you!
- I'll remember that!
"- And you wanted to return, remember?"
"- Well, yeah."
"I'll never forgive you, you understand?"
Unless...
"So, what is it?"
-It's warming.
-I'm just going to the bathroom.
"We are the first from our galaxy, to enjoy this feeling."
An uplifting feeling.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Nature will do you good.
I will arrive after you...
Don't lose your temper.
You know it's bad.
"You'll take a rest, everything will be like before."
"My little bunny will go to a nice forest,"
"snuggle down, yes, snuggle down..."
"Tell me, why don't you follow the program?"
"Who's the lady, Doctor?"
What have you done now?
"Yirinka, please!"
These are only friends.
Yirinka!
Never get married doctor.
It's terrible!
Yirinka...
Enough!
"Guys, I surrender!"
I'm a goner.
Look at me.
I don't sleep.
I wanted to sleep with the lady!
"That is, get married!"
"And getting married, doctor, does it relate somehow to reproduction?"
Go away.
Go away!
You don't think you can eat that.
We're building us a smudge pot so Patton can find us when he comes.
"Twenty parts of cellulose, one part phosphorous."
Watch.
He'll be able to see our smoke signal four miles away.
But Patton is 400 miles away.
"Well, I say, be prepared."
"- Heh, Ok, boy scout."
"-Hey, look what we got."
- The phonograph!
- Music!
"Put it down here, boys."
- We made a deal with Barracks 1.
"-Now, where's that distillery?"
"Over here, boys."
Let's have that distillery.
"Come on, we swapped it for the phonograph."
"Any objections, Sefton?"
Take it.
"- Hey, Price."
Any news on Dunbar?
-Huh?
"He's still at the kommandants office, that's all I know."
Don't worry.
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
- We'll give him a hearty welcome then

Hurrah!

But I have a hunch Daddy's gonna come back for his little girl.
So he's still alive.
"Not for very long, he isn't."
Don't screw up this time!
Motts!
You stay here with him.
Hey!
Do I look like I need a babysitter?
Sit down and shut up!
"Oh, shit."
Mr. President.
I..
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability..
to launch missiles at any target in the United States.
Our satellites show massive troop movements..
"in Russia, Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula."
"What are your orders, sir?"
"I swear to you all, I swear.."
that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!
No.
General..
how soon can you execute an air strike on the White House?
Sir.
We can have Raptors on target in 10 minutes.
Then do it.
Let's go to work!
Sir..
"Carol, we have to end this."
We have to.
I'm not like him!
Then I'll be the one who break your ribs if you are!
- Break my ribs?
- Beat you hard!
How are you?
"Times without you, are my wonderful times!"
"Sounds like, you do miss me!"
"But, what can I do?"
Seems like I don't miss you!
"What you have just said, makes me even happier than knowing you are a love child!"
Nice ring!
- Is that from your boyfriend?
"- Yes, it is."
You the first to know.
Engagement ring.
So I should congratulate you guys!
When will you guys getting married?
Hurry up!
- I can't believe that he is still shy!
- That's not related!
- Wine...
- Wine...
Let's toast for Yawang!
- Toast!
- For what?
"An early wish to you and Xiaotian, for eternal happiness in marriage, and have a baby boy soon!"
Great!
Have a baby boy!
Drink it!
I want to go to the toilet.
Hurry!
Whay do you want?
You won't for long!
"I'll have your throat out, you bloody swine!"
- Another two dozen!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Another two dozen!
"- What's wrong with you, Evans?"
- It's got worm in it.
"I'll eat weevils and maggots, but not red worms!"
Good food thrown on the deck.
You're spoiled.
You know that's an offence.
A flogging offence.
"You know that too, don't you?"
- He sent you.
- What?
"Yes, sir."
I know it.
While we consider the best course of action pick it up!
It's fit.
Eat it.
Eat it.
That's an order.
"You'll swing for this, every man jack of you!"
He's right.
We'll hang for striking an officer.
We're all in it.
We have to move fast.
What shall we do?
There is only one thing to do.
Give the signal.
"- When, now?"
- As soon as we can.
Mm-hmm.
"Need anything else, agents?"
"Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?"
Sorry.
She's out for the rest of the week.
"Hell of a time to take a vacation, right?"
"Okay, so, we have two victims, with seemingly nothing in common except, uh -- a love for eclairs."
Check this out.
What is that?
A birthmark?
Huh.
"So the weight had to come off somehow, right?"
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?
Okay.
"Uh, changeling?"
"Yeah, but changelings don't take over kids."
Neither of the vics had any.
And we don't know if Wayne McNut had a suction mark.
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.
"Well, we should, uh, split up."
One of us should hit the morgue.
The other should stay here and question the staff.
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.
Why?
Because you're weird around girls.
"What does that mean, weird?"
You're awkward.
"You know, weird -"
- Sam Weird.
I would know!
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!
"Yes, there was!"
"- Cooper, you need to calm down."
"- I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder."
- That's not possible.
"- Oh, my God."
"- It's not possible, Cooper."
"- Yeah, it is!"
"Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"- Unless, I mean..."
"- Oh, God."
Unless what?
I don't know.
"The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,"
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what?"
Stop the game.
I want out.
Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Safe word.
Fucking stop!
"- Okay, okay, just let us work it out."
"- Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
The great yoghurt investigation.
Oh.
I thought we would just be bringing our own lunch.
"Oh, I thought I'd bring lunch."
My treat.
"Oh, I thought we would just be having our own Tupperwares-type thing."
You weren't taking me out to lunch.
"No, but..."
It wasn't like a date.
No.
"I mean, two middle-aged people on a bench in Piccadilly."
"It's not exactly Roman Holiday, is it?"
No.
Be nice if it was.

Definitely.
Have some tea while you catch up on old times.
"Thanks,Jenny."
Be careful.
- Here's my friend's hand.
- Here's your tea.
- Thankyou.
- A pleasure.
Is he another friend ofyours?
"No, he's thejanitor."
We don't have a janitor in this building.
"Oh, he's the plumber."
There's a burst water pipe outside.
Your voice sounds familiar.
Have we met before?
I met you in the night club.
"I loved your singing, but you wouldn't sing without Jeffrey there."
"Oh, I remember."
What a coincidence.
"Dumbo, take care of Jenny for a while."
I'm going to the bathroom.
So am I.
There's a second bathroom in the bedroom.
"Jenny, there's a rat in the kitchen!"
I'll catch it.
This hallowed home of ours... we hold sacred
Here we dreamt our dreams
Like a prayer in a temple
Like a ray from the skies
Here we find succor
There were three parts to the will.
Mr. Malhotra donated a huge sum to many charities... one million Euro to his staff and everything else to Tisha.
But that will was burnt.
"Which means, according to the law..."
Mr. Malhotra died without a valid will.
"And that means... his only heir, inherits all his wealth."
Tisha gets everything.
Correct.
How much exactly is everything?
10 billion Euro.
"Sia, it's Tisha."
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She did what?
"Attempted suicide, sir."
She's at St. Marks' hospital right now.
What the bloody hell is going on?
"Sia, you go to the hospital."
I'll meet you at HQ later.
Let's go.
"I'm sorry, but I need to question Tisha."
"- Any problem, officer?"
- No.
It's just routine.
I'll wait.
Dad...
"That's fine, thank you."
"Tisha, what happened?"
I...
I...
I don't know.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
What?
"I'm sad, too."
It's okay to grieve.
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something
"I'm sad, too."
There'sgotto be something I can learn to make this better.

It doesn't-- less frightening.
It doesn't-- It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't-- It doesn't make any sense.

It doesn't make any sense.

"Yeah,it'sokaynot toknow ."
"Sometimes you don't know, and you may never know, and that's okay."
"Come on, let's get you out of here."
I think somebody needs to work on their sense of humor.
It was a joke.
Oh.
I'm Monica.
Got it.
Monica.
"So, Mike- Yes?"
What sort of impression do I make?
Come again?
If we were in a bar and you hadn't seen me before.
Oh.
Can I speak candidly?
I insist you speak candidly.
I'd think you were a hot piece of ass.
Good answer.
- Sarasvati.
"- Yes, Miss Mancuso?"
You told me you would have the opening day revenue report by now.
Where is it?
I'm afraid it's still being prepared.
Unacceptable.
Mr. Deline had some special requests.
He suggested you speak to him.
Come on.
Show some cleavage.
"It's a casino, not a convent."
"Okay, okay."
That's me taking the first counterfeit I found.
"Now, let's run it backwards... until we see that specific tray being removed from the cart."
All right?
Wow.
That's an easy gig.
Take care of Jean!
How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
while arms reductions are progressing over the world the focus of our attentions is on environmental issues.
global warming... all of these problems can be solved.
Macdougal!
Our country must always be the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon have to have this?
they could end up destroying their own country.
What is your real purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
No soldiers or militiamen.
- And the people who live here?
- They've fled.
The bastards' last visit must have convinced them to find a better place.
I'm picking up radio messages about troop movement along the border.
All right.
Drive on.
- I'm sorry that we have to say goodbye now.
- We'll meet again.
"- Goodbye, Mariá."
- Goodbye.
- Come on.
- I want to stay with Mariá.
No.
You're going with Padre Julio.
You're staying with him for a while.
"As soon as this war is over, we'll be together again."
I promise.
"Come on, Pablito."
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Don't drink so much Communion wine.
- We have a lot to do.
- It might be a small regiment.
They get scared when you say boo!
They're cowards.
Something must have happened.
They were talking about Ramírez.
It must be important.
Listen for as long as you can.
See you at the pass.
How are you?
All has been arranged?
"All, the meeting will be in Quito."
Shall we?
lets.
"Your attention please,"
Equatorian Aviation announces the arrival of flight 422 from Guayaquil.
Something for the press?
"Please, tell us something about the convention."
"Well,we have selected the best models."
and we will present the most exclusive of swimsuits.
I am certain it will be a big success.
As we all are.
"A photo please, thanks."
"""The Beach Club"""
"No, wait, Adriana!"
"Hold it, Adriana, its me!"
I can see you!
"My goodness, I know you have improved, but, you almost broke my neck."
Then why do you startle me?
I'll buy you a drink
When did you return?
I just came in.
This is my first night off.
is it?
First night?
Do you accept that drink?
Then we shall meet tonight!
"Say, Adriana, come here, wait!"
"Oh, excuse me."
Alex!
"Inspector, what are you up to?"
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
"Varun, what are you doing?"
- Leave me!
I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
"- I'll tell you, give it to me."
Wait here.
Where...
Juice will do?
Hello.
"- Yes, Sadhana."
Don't talk.
Stay on line.
"Had you not been here, I would have helpless."
How will I ever repay you Vikram?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.
Why are you so formal?
"Unless I miss my guess, the extra gravity oughta do it."
The Temple.
Where's the treasure?
Where is it?
Professor.
I'm coming.
"What's the line in the riddle about, uh, the ancients and the Book."
"""The Book shall summon up the power of the ancient ones."""
The Book shall summon the power.
The Book.
Give me the Book.
"You want the treasure, give me the Book."
These aren't book pages.
But what else could they be?
They're punch cards.
It must be an ancient...
"It's a computer, and these cards program it."
"Kelly, slide these in where the symbols match."
"Professor, let me see the Torch."
Here.
But how does it run?
A computer needs electricity.
Maybe not.
The people of Atlantis tapped into the volcano for power.
They used geothermal technology.
You mean this thing runs on heat?
No.
Steam.
Look!
Treasure chests.
Stay back.
It's nothing but paper.
There must be something more than pure casualty.
What makes you more scared?
To be alone...
"""N Passenger."
Do you think his kingdom has a future?
Yup.
Because?
Because...
I'm the king.
You look perfect.
This film will turn out great.
Okay.
You always look so tired.
"Sire, here is your speech."
Unbearable.
It won't retweet.
She already sent 11 texts.
How am I supposed to perform my duties and supervise the filming?
The Queen didn't want to cancel it on account of her annual cold.
Sire.
Sire.
Mr. Bulut notified me about the evening schedule.
Dance of Whirling Dervishes at 6 p.m.
A short speech at the end would be appropriate.
"Please refrain from mentioning Iraq, Syria,"
"Israel, the Kurds, Armenia, our federal issues and debt."
Soccer is a touchy subject as well.
Banquet starts at 8 p.m. Nine courses.
No kebab?
"Sire, the press conference in Miniatürk starts at 11 a.m."
"Your speech, Sire."
"I fall because of that girl, my heat has become candle."
One chance.
Only one chance.
Stand up.
And remember.
Forget about the girl and concentrate on the career.
I give you one more chance.
But keep in mind.
If your bullet would miss him.
Then my bullet will kiss you.
"This time i will shoot on throat, forget it!"
Shoot the rascal.
I am not even married yet.
Next week girl's parents are coming to see me.
Please let me go... i will free you first you free me.
On one condition.
Your every condition is accepted.
I will not kill him.
You will kill him.
No.
"No... don't do this... i have never even killed the bee, how can i kill a man?"
Teach him to kill bee.
You guys look very intelligent.
"Please let me go Sir,"
kill.
"Sir, what?"
Bee.
Bee?
Gently!
Its female.
Female?
Should not hurt.
"So we won't think about it now, will we?"
"No, sir."
"When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Well...
What would my little cherub like to do this evening?
"Oh, sir, could we go out?"
Out?
"You mean gad about a bit, see the sights?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir?"
"Well, now, I don't know."
I don't know.
That might be very charming.
Where would we go?
"Oh, they say that the Empire and such places..."
They do?
Who does?
"Well, Marcia, sir."
She says it's ever so gay.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yes.
"We can go, can't we?"
They say that the bill is ever so good.
And I haven't been out for so long.
No.
"No, that's right."
"You haven't, have you?"
You do look a little pale.
Yes.
"Yes, that's true."
"Not that I am complaining, you understand..."
Say something!
Father...
"Are you all right, Esther-san?"
!
"Don't worry, the count is all right!"
"There was another girl here, named Seth!"
W-what is this?
This light is a mausoleuma grave- for all Methuselah's.
This island is a place for remembering the deceased.
Friends and family of the departed gather and reminisce for a night.
That is how funerals are in the Empire.
It must be difficult for him...
Being unable to attend his grandmother's funeral...
Your Lordship...
"Whew, security sure has gotten tight!"
What a pain!
Duchess!
Do you know where Radu is?
!
No idea.
"But if he's going to target Her Majesty, it would most likely be during tonight's funeral..."
He will come!
There's no question about it!
I'll go do my rounds again.
Don't worry!
I won't let him assassinate anyone!
Esther!
Yes?
!
The count is in your hands.
I'm coming with you!
No!
Would you mind autographing this for me?
Where did you get my picture?
From a little frame out by the door.
"Oh, hold on, that's mine."
"Oh, well, I'd prefer whenever you're smiling."
"- Do you, ever?"
"- Yes, when I'm amused."
"You know, I think I could use you in my fall production."
I don't play animal-act.
"No, really."
I'm putting on a Broadway show next season.
"You're putting on your show right now, and it's a flop."
Wait a minute.
I'll meet you out front.
Hey.
[laughing]
I hope you make it in time for your fall production.
How did I get in?
"Oh, man!"
"Goodbye, partner."
[screaming] Help!
[intense music]
[tapping foot]
[swing music]
- You're a college graduate?
"- Yes, sir."
- Travelled here and abroad?
"- Yes, sir."
- How many languages you speak?
"- Five, sir."
"Well, I think we can use you."
"Salary, 22.50 a week."
Of course I am.
Take your hands off me.
- Sir?
Am I in error?
- Thank heaven you're here.
- You can see I'm a gentleman.
- Look at his lovely clothes.
"- Take him, Dawlish."
- But you can't.
"- Vizard, you sail tomorrow?"
"- Yeah, Mediterranean."
- So you should count us out for now.
- No need.
Spread word to that fleet.
"If both fleets struck at once, we'd win our demands overnight!"
"- You'll act soon, then?"
"- Yes, soon every ship will mutiny."
- Before spring?
- Depends.
How's your crew?
Forty more pledges.
- We have half the ship already.
- Good.
"Poor men, driven like cattle."
I don't understand it.
Having to be pressed to go to sea?
- Not everyone wants to leave home.
- Think of it!
Sailing the Defiant and fighting the French.
You sound just like your father.
"Anyway, the admiral may not agree to let you go."
Father's back.
"OK, long story, short version."
I was going to marry his ex-wife.
(CHUCKLES) Seriously?
!
"What, and now you're mates, and everything?"
"(CHUCKLES) Well, mates is probably pushing it."
So where is she?
"His ex, your missus?"
She died.
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.
You weren't to know.
- What about you?
How do you know him?
- Don't.
Not really.
"As far as I'm concerned, he's this random smurf popped up out of nowhere."
So why the...?
Long time ago my dad killed this girl.
"It was by accident and everything, but... he panicked."
Cut her up and whatnot.
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.
I'm sorry.
"So this bloke, Luther, was one of the coppers that put him away."
And your dad?
Killed himself in prison.
"Jenny, listen, I know how hard..."
how hard it can be.
Losing someone that way.
When I was broke I would go out and rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
I'm an average nobody.
I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
-What's up?
-Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat?
No.
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.
He's still alive.
You fuckin' piece of shit!
"Die, you motherfucker!"
Look at me!
Look into my fuckin' eyes.
Die!
You could always stay at my house lt's better there I have a fireplace and supplies
Are you asking me to move in with you?
"- Well, I suppose..."
- l thought you didn't like children
Me?
- It was you who didn't want...
"- OK, just leave it"
"Anyway, we're not coming"
Your friends are here
"We may have caught your attacker ln fact, he could be dead"
Simon Delaître.
He attacked the waitress from the bar
Simon Delaître?
He can't hurt you now
Hi
- Hi
- Has Léna called?
No I told the police.
They don't care.
They think she has just run off
Who is in here?
"Hello, Jérôme I might have guessed."
What have you told them?
The truth
"Jérôme, listen to me"
Frédéric knows about Camille.
She needs protecting
She needs protecting from him
You can't trust him.
"He's a fraud, but you can't see it"
"Please, stop it"
"Camille, go upstairs"
Can't make a perfect world.
"No matter what, shit happens."
It felt really nice to be desired today.
It meant a lot.
Thank you.
"Honey, i always desire you."
"Usually, it just annoys you."
No.
You want to have sex all the time.
"Today, you desired me."
okay.
Okay.
We still don't know the truth about jane.
I'm just saying.
Madeline had anger issues.
Itty bitty ball of rage.
Wanna see her rage issues?
"Call her ""itty bitty."""
"Renata had the whole kind of ""sexy praying mantis,"
"Bite your head off after sex"" thing going."
"Oh, yeah, that bonnie's just the sweetest thing."
"Yeah, right."
"Celeste-- she is an accomplished attorney,"
And some people in this town resent that.
"Rich, beautiful, madly in love."
Something had to be wrong.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you thinking?
I'm trying to decide whether i'm happy or sad.
People usually know.
I'm sad because--
"so Yawang, you have to be happy!"
Yawang!
Yawang.
You will never know that my basic wish was
just to admire the paradise together with you.
I think we will see each other in the next life.
"At that time,"
I'll be waiting for you!
"At that time, if you don't come,"
I will stay young!
"At that time, you would not loose me again."

I can't confirm that.
Is there a problem?

This drilling is driving me nuts.
I wanna find David and Meredith.
You sure no one else could be in here?

I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
- Think they got what they came for?

It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.

"They're en route, but they're at least an hour away."
"From the satellite feed of the island,"

Use extreme caution.
You need to find Bosley and Amanda.
"We won't let you down, Charlie."
"- Good luck, angels."
"- Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Come on.
Nice house.
Being a bad guy certainly has its perks.
I spot one guard.
There could be more inside.
Let's go say hello.
"Well, here it is."
"What's the matter, Mr. Stancati?"
Make an offer.
That's why you're here.
Maybe his employers can't afford to pay.
I don't have that problem.
"There are other influential people, why don't you go to them?"
For example...
-For example...
-No need.

Meaning...

Agreed.
No.
No more.
I'm in charge now.
Have you found my mother?
"I need her now, more than ever."
They said she's with the king.
Trying to wring more out of henry
"Before I'm married to anyone, no doubt."
But who will you marry?
Have you spoken with bash?
No.
Francis?
Catherine:
Could we have a moment?
What an eventful day.
"Francis's return,"
Help!
"Over here, Indy!"
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move it!
Help me!
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!
Indy!
Indiana Jones!
"Help me, Jones!"
Jones!
Marion!
Indy!
Marion...
Dr. Jones.
You looking for me?
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other."
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Twenty-four!
"- Punishment completed, sir."
- Cut him down.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Cut him down.
Ship's company!
Turn forward!
Dismissed!
"Fair weather, Mr. Ponsonby."
"""I, Richard Dawlish, of His Majesty's ship, Defiant do swear to be true to the cause and serve on the counsel of action."
"- Even to the laying down of my life."""
"- Well done, Dawlish."
"""Corsica, Leghorn, last remaining British bases."" Message ends."
- Acknowledge.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
"Grave news, sir."
Napoleon's overrunning Italy.
Spain will be on his side.
- I presume you want to put in here.
- Nothing changed our orders...
"- No, but since..."
...which are to proceed to Corsica.
Set the t'gallants.
"Take over the watch, Mr. Ponsonby."
Sir.
- We should return to Gibraltar.
- Have you set the t'gallants?
"- No, not yet, sir."
- Why not?
"If we go to Corsica, we may sail into a trap."
- I have my orders.
"- Yes, sir to join Admiral Jarvis, who may not be there."
- How long has it been since you saw them?
Almost four years.
A beer?
"- No, I have to...."
- All the others went into town.
"A beer in the canteen, just the two of us."
Is that a date?
We can call it that if it helps.
- It helps.
- Good.
Cheers!
Thank you guys.
"Didn't think we'd let you get away that easily, did you?"
Skinnarland sends his love.
Apparently they're in trouble with the police chief who's threatening to blow their covers.
So you are going to be very busy.
Keep your backs straight.
One-two-three...
Good.
Thanks.
- Einar reports good weather in the area.
- Good.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
The war should be over in a couple of months.
I might pop over and see you myself.
"- Good luck, Tronstad."
- Thank you.
Well...
See you soon.
Good luck.
Leif Tronstad never reunited with his family.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Shun-baa.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 1O grand, don't you think?"
LWlhaveitready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
These frightened people to scared to live
But why is it that it is the women who is beaten and tied?
Is there not enough of that in reality?
Plenty of men like being beaten and tied
If it makes people happy is it bad?
I saw your friend Julia being arrested
It's finished except for one thing
I need another figure
Is Paul around?
Paul
Stand next to Julia
Wonderful
My legs are longer than that
My bum is too big
My breasts are a bit small
Mine are too big
My bum is not that shape and the're a different size
What is that bush between my legs?
Near Nagerkoil...
"Hey, I'm driving!"
(Song playing)
Don't be mean.
A kiss is all I asked.
No way.
"Hey, please!"
Just one kiss...
Like this.
I Promise.
- Fraudster
What do you call this?
That was just rehearsal.
"All right, all right."
Then the way I see it is somebody's going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside, your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
He's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
"You don't give us the name of your supplier, you're going nowhere."
"Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary."
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
You cooperating?
Let's start with a name.
He just goes by Heisenberg.
Heisenberg?
How old is Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
Height?
"Average, I guess."
"Medium height, medium weight."
- What color hair?
- No hair.
Dude's balder than you.
1963.
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted of stealing a vending machine.
1975.
Breaking and entering.
1982.
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen,"
I guess that just about wraps it up.
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?
Subtitles resynced by Maza
The poison is still fresh...three days.
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would have killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you."
And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory.
"Oh, the money's fine."
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen, I guess that just about wraps it up."
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
- Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
You have to go.
- Turn around!
You won't hurt him.
You can't.
"- Thank you for teaching me the meaning of pain, Nurse Oaks."
Glad I could return the favour.
- Isabel.
That was quite a performance.
- Hmm.
"- Do you know Hawthorne's ""The Gray Champion""?"
- Yes.
It's the story of a legendary warrior who comes to the aid of those oppressed by tyranny and injustice.
- Yes.
Yes.
Exactly.
This is your finest performance yet.
You... you are The Gray Champion.
- I am The Gray Champion?
"- Yes, this fine institution of..."
"of healing has been overrun with decadence and filth, and... like an avenging angel, you have purified it."
Don't you see?
- This is still part of my treatment.
"- Yes, exactly."
Exactly.
This is all part of my plan.
You and I have purified Rosewood.
Now... you're finally home.
Isabel.
"Isabel, you're healed."
- I'm healed?
- Yes.
Yes.
I found about the courier by hacking into
My father's computer a couple of days ago.
When?
Two days ago.
Then I called you.
When did you hack into his computer?
Sydney.
Two days ago.
Everything I'm telling you
"Is the truth, I swear."
So your father's still alive?
Yes.
And I would do anything
To bring him down.
"(courier:)this is not my fault, da veiga."
You saw me.
I followed instructions.
Somebody compromised our security.
"What, you going to tell the council?"
Obviously one of our dikes needs plugging.
Did you get a good look at
The person with fox and bailey?
I could pick him out a line-up.
Do you want me to go track them down?
[gun shots]
No.
Thank you.
You know what this means?
"Yeah, we're in it up to our eyeballs."
Karen was right.
(syd:)it was coincidence.
(nigel:) was it?
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master DeIacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"Up, quick!"
We have food for a picnic!
And a donkey!
"Come, before the dreaded duchess finds us."
Cheers.
Come on!
What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(men laugh)
only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.
- (baby screams) - (Liszt groans)
"George has gone off, it seems."
- shall we go and look for her?
- Can you walk?
Not presently.
Let's slaughter a cow!
"Baso, grab it!"
Grab its legs!
Come on!
I've cut off the head of the Japanese Governor-general
Wow!
What a party!
Sir Yoshimura
Whose wedding day is it?
It's Watan and Lubi's
Come!
"Have a drink with us, sir"
No
- No
"- Come on, have a drink"
No way
I don't drink the wine with your nasty saliva in it
"- Come on, have a drink"
- I told you that I don't want to
Your hand is all dirty with blood
- I invited you with good will
- You son-of-a-bitch!
You've soiled me with blood!
I offered you a drink and you hit me?
I'll beat you into senses!
- Stop!
- I don't need to reason with a savage
What is it?
Let's go look!
Hurry up!
I know what you said just now with a boar's head in your hand
Out of my way!
I must look like I was attacked by wolves.
"I apologize, I didn't even notice."
"Mmm, uh..."
Could you excuse me while I go to the ladies' room
- for a minute?
"- Sure, sure."
Do you enjoy dancing?
I used to love to dance with my father.
You?
I find it embarrassing.
I enjoy watching it.
"- Oh, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Watching?
- Pairs...
It's interesting how coupling appears in nature and in mathematics.
- You were talking about pairs...
- The twin-prime conjecture.
"It explores pairs of prime numbers, numbers that are only divisible by themselves."
Three-five.
Five-seven.
Not seven-nine...
- Nine can be divided by three.
- That's right.
"Then you have 11-13, and 17-19 and so on."
It was discovered that pairs were often separated by...
One number in between.
Exactly.
Did you read my book?
"- No, I'm sorry."
- That's all right.
This is really marvelous.
But we're still gonna have to have DMV retest her.
For me.
"Hello, Henry."
That's a boy.
That's a boy.
"See, Daddy?"
Daddy?
Henry.
"You know, I wonder if some kids might have picked up that baby food."
"Maybe, but the way those boxes were bouncing out of that truck they could have gone anywhere."
"Oh, no."
There's that couple.
Remember that couple yesterday with the flat tire?
Of course.
Scavengers.
That's it!
They must have hung around.
I think we're getting senile.
Not me.
"Oh, what happened?"
What did you do now?
- We know where the baby food is.
- Where?
- A gypsy van.
- A school bus.
"- Hey, slow down now."
- Scavengers.
"Slow down, slow down."
Hold it.
"Now, tell me about it."
"After we cited the baby-food truck about half a mile further, we saw a school bus..."
"Converted school bus, gypsy van, loaded like you can't believe."
Help!
- Guerrilleros!
"- Get over there, everybody!"
Block that side!
Take cover!
That bastard won't get away from me.
Hurry up!
Take off!
Enrique!
They're trying to get away in their copters.
We might still get them.
- Why are they shooting?
"- We're safe, Padre."
We're safe.
A new magazine.
Try to get into the hospital.
"Shit, we're trapped!"
"Concepción and the others, where are they?"
They're... they're dead.
"Come on, hurry up!"
I think they're all gone.
Enrique!
They nearly killed me.
That priest over there saved my life.
"Come on, we must flee before they come back and kill us all."
You are Enrique Carrasco?
You have to stop this madness.
"Hey, that doesn't look good."
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
"- Héctor, the lorries."
- Get these people to safety.
"When the militia return, they'll kill you all."
But...
Darling!
-Did you throw a bottle from the window?
!
"-No, Mr. Vanyerka."
-I wish!
"Stay covered, miss."
For now.
"One, two."
Rascals!
Is it possible to get any privacy here?
!
"-Don't be cross with me, I don't know, what..."
Mr. Vanyerka?
"What happened, Mr. Vanyerka?"
Mr. Vanyerka?
"Oh, a bump!"
"Come round, Mr. Vanyerka."
"Well, wake up!"
"Yirinka, Wait!"
Yirinka!
Now look.
Was that necessary?
Mr. Vanyerka?
Where have they sent us?
We're here.
-They are people.
-Beautiful.
"It's a nice sunny day, once again, good morning."
We will open a window and take a deep breath.
"For the floor, actually for your arms, now calls another exercise, only for ambitious athletes, because these will be press-ups."
"So, a nice, straight push-up on your arms, legs backwards, we start by bending the arms down, but we are not laying on the belly doing this, we are stretching our arms nicely making a push-up"
You didn't do anything.
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure! rambling on like a lunatic.
So much easier for you.
Easier?
Jesus!
nothing!
please be like the rest of the world blaming someone else for your boring shit.
I'm such a giant disappointment.
You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing?
what are we doing?
Hmm?
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.
I see that.
there are others.
Does that mean nothing to you?
means nothing to me.
Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books.
What are you talking about?
will you?
Take out two pills and give them to him.
- Logan!
Logan!
- Give 'em to him.
Now!
I wanna see it.
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...
Motherfucking auto-trucks.
Logan.
And you're screaming at a machine. huh?
She can learn to be better.
better than me?
"And eww, why're you so dramatic?"
My hit points are going down
Sent!
What'd you send?
A picture of Lin getting excited about this gross room
"It's gross, isn't it?"
Yeah
But... awesome!
Thank you
"Kidding, I'm about to puke"
Big Sis...
Obviously I'm kidding.
Otherwise it'd just be offensive
"Anyways, love what you've done with the place"
Now it's not sad!
"The bathtub is pretty cool, too"
Really?
Can I take a look?
Of course.
This way
"Lin, come too"
Ok.
Can I take pics?
Sure
Holy crap!
Gross!
I didn't do anything with my life
That hunting today got me thinking
"When I was younger, I just watched anime or went to brothels and forgot about it"
"Ignoring the root of the problem, I was satisfied with immediate pleasure"
Youth is a crime
"No, I am full of potential"
What about you?
Me?
I was alone...
Until now.
Openly flirting?
Have you never seen a pretty girl in your life?
"No, I was waiting for you."
Do you do anything else other than charm people?
Juggling.
"- Hey, we have just met, okay?"
- Okay.
Slow down.
Spend some time with me and you will find out everything.
"Oh, mystery."
You guys think that if you speak less..
..hide a few things then the girl will stay interested.
Your smile itself is mysterious.
If you can spare a moment from looking at me..
..then let me know what you'll drink.
Whatever you want.
Why do you do this to yourself?
Why do you do it?
"You got jealous, right?"
I mean... you are drinking alone to drown your sorrows.
You could have joined me.
Stupid girl.
That isn't my drink.
And I am not alone.
Who told you that?
- So who's with you?
- I've found someone.
- Who?
This high council is adjourned.
[âª]
Mace?
Follow da veiga.
Tap into his tracer frequency.
He'll see the power spike.
It will be too late.
"Thanks, karen."
I'm not surprised you can't find
Any information on the scabbard.
"Well, I still have a few more"
People to hear back from.
Do you want me to wait?
No.
It seems we've stirred up
The hornet's nest here.
"I need you to pack up,"
Get out of there
And just keep your phone on.
You don't have to ask me twice.
"Okay, thanks, kate."
"No, interpol have no information"
On the scabbard either.
Looks like we've reached a dead end.
What about your father's house?
"Yes, it's possible"
He already has the scabbard.
You don't mean go there?
We'd be sitting ducks.
I know the combination to his safe.
Great.
And I think I can get us past the alarms.
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps...
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
She was in possession of the original piece for years.
"She may know much, if properly motivated."
"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
That is not your reputation.
But it needn't concern you.
I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We've hit stone!
Clear it off.
"Come on, find the edges."
"Good, good, good."
"You see, Indy?"
You see?
"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
"As a team, boys!"
As a team!
Push!
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.
"Good, good, that's it."
Watch your toes.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"Sorry, Indy."
Indy... why does the floor move?
"- No, I wouldn't dare put anyone out."
"The ambulance won't be here for two hours, shall we grab some grub?"
"Here, you buy what you like!"
"Cigarettes, candy..."
But there was no fog in Budapest.
What was the name of your mental hospital again?
Will you remember my bros' names?
I'm so sorry... it's my head... hurts...
"Beauty, fitness, sickness, women!"
That's my cousin's name...
"Whatever, all of them whores."
Except one!
Dig it?
"""Clog""!"
Here you have to buy!
"And to buy, you have to pay!"
Enjoy it?
"Snap, rush, touchdown!"
"Here, they shield everything in the same way."
"Their women, their armchairs, their money, their paintings."
"They're so wary, and rightly so."
Now we're fisting!
- Glitz and glamor...
"- Come on, Prince!"
Like some shit?
Have it!
Choke on it!
See that!
"Fisticuffs, huh?"
Do you think I look snazzy enough?
"My partings, my nails... my feet?"
My earrings.
He will notice
Where 's your corset?
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.
But you are not properly dressed
"Who is to say what is ""proper""?"
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head, would you wear it?"
Alice ...
"For me, a corset is like a codfish"
"Please, not today."
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
"It's always the same, ever since I can remember"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
"Now, can you manage to smile?"
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive
"Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you ."
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4?
Now everything I've been rushed through
- I am sorry.
"- Oh, nevermind."
Forgive my wife.
(PANTING)
Christina!
Christina!
"(STRUGGLING) Tris, help me."
Tris!
(CHRISTINA PANTING)
It's okay.
We removed this from the body of the suicide.
Marlene.
Her name was Marlene.
I'm sorry.
Marlene.
It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.
It also has a radio transmitter in its head.
How do we get them out?
I don't know.
This tech was built to defend itself.
This tendril wraps around the nearest major artery.
Try to remove them and they kill the host.
(ALL MURMURING)
CHRISTINA:
So what do we do?
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else.
EDGAR:
Or we could do the logical thing.
And we hand her over.
Nobody knows about this alliance.
We have to protect that advantage.
"If we hand Tris over now, might buy us some time."
(ALL AGREEING)
FOUR:
I think it's a good idea.
I am serious!
"You are not my type, and... we are not suitable each other, and..."
I... don't like girl with big face!
Mr...
Mr. Chen!
I'm not talking about you.
Who did this?
Who put these porn photos inside my book?
"These are not mine, Sir!"
Really not mine!
Not mine!
It hurts!
"Sir, those are not mine really!"
I'm innocent!
Yawang!
- Yawang.
- Yes...
Do you want to earn some pocket money?
Money?
"Yes, of course!"
What should I do?
- Be a private tutor.
- For whom?
His name is Xiamu.
His father was my best friend.
"When he was 4, his father lost everything in business and committed suicide!"
"His mother could not stand the pressure from creditors, and hung herself!"
Most unfortunately little Xiamu witnessed this.
Since then he has rarely talked and become withdrawn.
"By being his private tutor, you may help this kid."
It looks like real one!
Don't be stingy!
They're getting very close.
Blake!
How did you get back so soon?
Get ready to leave.
There's a ship coming up on you fast.
You've got about three minutes.
"We have the neutrotope now, nothing else matters."
- I'll get the others.
- I'll be back in a minute.
He's cutting it too fine.
"Come on Blake, get out of there."
"No, no I won't!"
- She must be taken back for trial.
- Agreed.
I won't go!
- Everything set?
"- Yes, ready."
Bring us across Vila.
They're locked on.
[EXPLOSION]
What was that?
I rigged a charge on the entry hatch.
"Right, I think we can get you all home now."
"Zen, set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
Confirmed.
Take us round the easy way this time.
Hello?
"You weren't at work today, were you, Elizabeth?"
Waiting for my call?
"Look, you've won"
I'm leaving Don't go
A place to return to.
"""I'm home."""
"Yes, ""I'm home."""
Welcome home.
Two days ago we got a transfer request.
A graduate of the shaolin school of martial Arts.
currently a member of the lacrosse team.
The team requested permission to join the league.
apparently they have a new coach.
The beach volley team requests permission for an overseas tour.
Destination:
Australia.
First kneel down.
Hold the stick at an angle of 45to your body.
"Then, with one smooth movement..."
Don't rely just on force.
flow like water.
"Rin, this is fun!"
These are the basics of Shaolin Kung Fu.
Come for a sec.
What?
Standing Zen!
Don't do anything.
Alright!
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force ejects the ball like a bullet.
The lower body is also important.
Its muscles control the speed.
This is Kung Fu.
"Alright, Minmin."
Give it a try.
OK.
"Our message is about peace, love and universal harmony."
Loser!
And about finding balance and cosmic energy through Zenovation.
- Open up your minds to a new reality.
- Losers!
- Screw harmony and peace.
- And that chi stuff.
This is just too easy.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
"And the pictures of the kids, your family, nice people."
"Hey, mind if I wear this?"
You got any tickets to the policemen ball?
"Well, guys, you ready?"
Okay.
- We're back.
- We're back.
What happened yesterday was our fault.
- Un-American.
- Un-Pennsylvanian.
- Un-Charlestownonian.
- Un-Hansonian.
This town needs a good punch in the nose.
- A kick in the teeth.
- A jab in the spleen.
Bernie's hitting us below the belt.
"Fellas, we're here to show you how to help fight back."
- And we have reinforcements.
"- Guys, come on in."
These are our boys.
Dit.
(sighs)
"Well, unexplained things, secrets, occurrences that we're really not supposed to talk about?"
Oh.
Well...
"I believe that there are moments, experiences that someone like McGee, with his trusty computer, couldn't justify."
"When Gibbs left tonight,"
I... thought I saw it again.
Saw what?
The bounce.
"You know, I've been thinking about that."
Boss don't bounce.
"You cannot expect a person to keep things bottled up inside forever, can you?"
RYAN:
"Mm, charades."
Let's play.
Now?
(snorts)
It's as good a time as any.
(chuckles)
No.
Why not?
"Because I don't play games, Doc."
(laughs)
Like hell you don't.
"You know, people keep looking at their watch, usually means they're worried about something."
You got to run?
"Oh, I've been running."
Maybe it's time you stopped?
I wish I could.
You can.
Parker can.
You have no idea.
Small root beer.
Would you like fries with that?
I would.
Thank you very much.
I almost forgot.
[Whistling]
[Cash drawer opens]
[Coins clink]
I'll just be sitting outside.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your order?
[Indistinct chatter]
You ready to work?
- Where's Ryan?
- He's with his old man.
How you feeling?
"Deprived on every fucking level, but ready to fight."
How you feeling?
I feel good.
Thank you.
"I'm gonna have you see a nutritionist, okay?"
"We'll cut the weight, and you won't lose so much strength."
You talk to Lisa?
I have.
"A lot of other gyms that I can go to, man."
"I'm not letting you out of the gym, pal."
"You're too important here, okay?"
I'm gonna give you everything I give Ryan.
I promise.
"Hey, what do you think about this one..."
this girl?
Got to ask Ryan about that one.
And entered your hot and wet vagina.
Your cherished sexy lips of ardent lust and desire.
And so flush in the springtime of your passion.
Can you feel my cock as your clitoris between your fingers?
"Every stroke of yours, it gets bigger and harder."
"Feel it, love, are you coming?"
"Respond, Rosella, tell me that you can feel it."
"Yes, I am sorry!"
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Slowly!
Gently!
I can't take any more.
No!
Come slowly too.
"Gently, slowly."
What dominating fingers you have!
It makes me crazy.
"Yes, like that, penetrate my yoni, please."
I love you deep iside.
"Take my bushy cunt, I beg you."
Don't stop.
More cock inside.
Stronger please.
Take it.
"Push it, we are getting there, forcefully."
"Yes, that's good."
We are coming together.
"Yes, that's it!"
"More, keep it going!"
"Squeeze my balls, my darling."
That feels so good!
Coffee.
Same here.
And two glasses of water.
"It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious."
I saw the film.
And?
Nothing.
Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.
So people know how desperate the situation is.
It's exceptional.
I didn't say I don't agree.
I totally do.
You live with Jean-René?
A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre.
With members of the collective.
The film you made in Italy...
Is it finished?
We're still debating.
Comrades find it politically questionable.
It's tense but fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.
We have an office.
"I answer the phone, tend to the prints."
It keeps me busy.
I want to go to college but I missed registration.
I may go to London.
To be a gofer on a film.
It may not work out.
What film?
Nothing like yours.
Go on.
Science fiction.
- No.
No.
- You were?
- I have no alarm triggered.
"Minds, motherfucker!"
"Easy, easy."
Enough!
- It 's okay.
- Phooey!
"- Come, go."
"- You're lucky, you bastard!"
Let's go!
Where would you get you parked your Prius?
What the hell is that?
If the cops keep coming for November we need it.
It displays up!
Give it up.
Avoid all main roads.
Shit!
You'll be fine.
All right?
N-one to hurt anyone.

He was just 17.
And a prodigy.
- How do you know him?
"- I'm sorry, Duval."
I thought this was some drug deal gone south.
I thought he'd give us someone to go after.
Go after for what?
The kid who wrote this...
he's dead.
He O.D.'d.

Exceptional intellects don't fit in.

Duval:
This has been happening all along.
All O.D.'d like Kevin Whitfield.
All within 18 months.
Maybe there is someone to go after.
You shouldn't be in here
- Are these yours?
"- No, my brother's"
Here
Thanks
Whose are they?
Your ex's?
They were my mother's
Turn around
That stuff really worked.
The pain has gone completely
"OK, you can turn around"
"It suits me, doesn't it?"
Are you closed?
The power is down.

"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
"Please, you have to tell him."
"It's okay, the baby's fine."
Not the baby.
Okay.
He killed Sean.

"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
"Well, not completely."
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post-traumatic stress.
Or maybe a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.

Check the damage in the dispensary!
"Everything's all right here, colonel!"

"- Yes, sir."
This is the usual procedure.
About every other night.
Harassment.
It's pretty good shooting.

It's a sure thing that they have eyes inside our camp.

Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.
"Lieutenant Green, form a recon patrol, ASAP!"
GREEN:
"Petersen, come with me."
MacDANIEL:
Who is it?
"Lt's the captain, sir."
Better move him out of there.
"-lt's a risky exercise, man."
Take care!
- Do not be afraid.
Stepa will survive my attack.
"I'm not anxious about him, I worry about you."
You may get bruised.
Nowwhat?
"Well, did you take this prisoner?"
-You really know some tricks!
- ls yourwar over?
-Over.
"- l'll teach you how to use all these tricks against me, an ex-con asshole!"
It is not a real trick.

"-Yes, completely."
Malakhov!
You are assigned to Sergeant Pozdneeva.
-What for?
I am saying that I can help you.
Have you found a clue?
Is that...?
It can't be.
This was left at the scene of the fire.
I believe that this scrap of cloth is from the cloak of Professor Moriarty.
Moriarty?
An odd little man who fancies himself a criminal genius.
"So, he stole the engine..."
Dear...!
"Please help them, Mr. Holmes."
Ouch!
Ouch!
What the devil is this?
An engine?
!
Who would dare drop such a filthy old thing out of the sky?
!
That's Moriarty's aircraft Pteranodon!
Did he intentionally drop it on me?
After him!
Give chase!
Go!
What a wonderful engine!
"With this, there's no doubt that I will win the world championship."
I knew that we couldn't win with the engine that the Professor built.
Did you say something?
Uh...well.
Nothing.

- Yes.
Have you got something to tell me?
"Yes, I would advise you to get out of here."
- How many of them were there?
- Eight.
- Too bad that Carrasco wasn't there.
- That girl out there is also one of them.
"- Coronel, I'm in the militia."
- Calm down.
You mustn't get excited.
I know him.
It's true.
He was here before the guerrilleros occupied the hospital.
His name is Gutiérrez.
"- You were lucky, my friend."
"- Yes, but if you hadn't come..."
You're not supposed to talk so much.
Be quiet.
This is José Grenada.
He worked on the dam.
They seem to treat their prisoners quite well.
Did you hear them talk about their leader Carrasco on your way here?
Think carefully.
You must have heard something.
Very well.
I will never tell a bastard like you anything.
Never!
What are you waiting for?
Keep calm.
Don't panic.
Nothing's happened.
What have you done?
My name's Danny Ferman.
I'm one of the attorneys representing Malcolm Miller.
"Look, if this is about that juror, the cops already turned this place inside out."
"Okay, so I assume they checked the camera footage already."
Fakes.
Just there to scare anyone looking to cause trouble.
Like you.
Were you working the night of the assault?
You were here?
Yes.
And I've already been interviewed.
"Okay, what did you tell the cops?"
- That I don't remember seeing him.
"Bar was a little crazier than usual, but..."
My girlfriend was having a little birthday thing.
Girlfriend?
So you're...
Gay guys are the best tippers.
"Yeah, I mean, not that..."
"You know, it doesn't matter."
Anyway.
Anyway.
"Birthday, okay."
"Cake, presents, the whole thing?"
Yeah.
She needs a lot of attention.
"Did you happen to take any photo, videos or..."
Look at this.
Okay.
Recognize him?
No.
Could you send me this file?
"God bless einstein,"
But i had to boost his theory just a little.
Case in point.
"Well, look like i won't be using that tesseracter."
This is confusing for me.
"So much about me was lost,"
So much forgotten.
"Well, then, why don't you tell me"
What you do remember?
"I remember it made me happy to be here,"
"On this ship,"
With you.
"On the other hand,"
"Andromeda, rommie, doyle... i don't even know what to call myself."
I'll tell you what.
Why don't i just call you... friend.

What are you talking?
Do you know how badly you cheated me?
The lies you told me.
Cheating?
Lying?
For this simple matter.
Is this a simple matter.
If you know what really happened...
What happened?
I said that I joined the job for you.
I didn't like it.
"So, I quit the job."
You got the information from some idiot.
You got hurt.
Is that all?
Not only that.
Didn't you call my love silly?
"If you keep shouting at me, anyone would say that."
You were no less.
I was after you to make you say I love you.
You said that at the time of our separation.
How would I feel?
Frustrated.
What are you staring at me?
You were trying to make me remember something.
You wanted to say something.
C'mon talk.
You said you don't remember your past.
You're right.
Did you read about the nuns?
The ones who were raped by missionaries in Africa.
The priests themselves!
It's horrible!
"If you can't trust a missionary, what's to become of us?"
- They used to rape the local women.
- Really?
"Because of AIDS, they started raping the nuns."
"Oh, my God!"
And I had the missionaries on a pedestal.
I'm sure not all of them are rapists.
- I hope not.
"- No, some are pedophiles."
- What's that?
- Everybody loves fucking...
"Shut up, Antonio."
You're such a brute.
- How do the bulls look?
"- Good, but heavy."
- What do you reckon?
"- Over 1,000 lbs."
Holy shit!
I'm going to our bar.
"Lydia, remember we're eating at home."

Good luck.
Bull's coming.
"Don't cry, love."
Hello.
How is she?
"Poor thing, very bad."
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just want...
You just want to be free.
Exactly.
Hmm.
Thank you.
Isabel.
Roderick.
My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
And how is the famous doctor?
The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
I'm sorry.
"Dr. cairn says it's a part of the healing process, a side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?

You speak badly about our women?
"Step away, brother!"
Move!
What are you doing?
What are you all doing?
Leave me.
I will shoot her.
"Making fusses, bloody!"
"What else can be expected of you, Impotent?"
"Stop it, girl!"
You call us Impotent?
Shall I show you our manhood?
I won't have my decisions questioned.
Go below until I give you permission to come on deck.
Clear?
"Yes, sir."
Quite clear.
Mr. D'Arblay set the gallants.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Set the gallants!
A beating every day for a week.
- Why won't the captain do something?
- What can he do?
- You all right?
- Thank you.
"Come on, then."
We'll go down together.
Easy now.
Muster on the gun deck.
Move!
- These stripes are healing nicely.
"- They're still bloody painful, sir."
"His own son, eh?"
Can't the captain see what's going on?
"Hey, you, come here."
Sit down.
You said captain can't do anything.
What did that mean?
- I was guessing...
- What's it mean?
"If he went for Scott-Padget over this, there'd be a court-martial."
They'd prove he attacked an officer to protect his son.
That'd finish him.
"If Scott-Padget has influence, it'd be easily done."
Sam Polivy's back with a ureteral stone.
P-O-L-I-V-Y.
Abby?
Those labs back on Melinda Harrell?
- Let me check.
"- Hi, I'm Erin Harkins."
- I'm on the phone.
- You're busy.
We get it.
Can we get an approximate time orientation will begin?
Doctor?
Don't tell me you're keeping med students waiting.
- Check with Pratt.
- I'm checking with you.
- Intractable pain and hydronephrosis.
- Dr. Carter?
I cannot admit him to Eight West.
There are no beds.
"I'm Dr. Weaver, Chief of Emergency Medicine."
"I will give you a brief tour of the ambulance bay, after which our Chief Resident will give you his attention."
"Because, as you'll learn, it's his primary responsibility."
Come on.
- Sorry.
What was that?
- Demolition-site accident downtown.
- At least a dozen injuries.
- ETA?
- Now.
- I gotta call you back.
Paramedics can transport using standing field protocols-
- We've got multiples.
- Wait here.
You know that?
Completely hopeless.
- Any sign ofthem?
"- No, Your Majesty."
We've searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
"Well, keep looking."
"Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored."
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
"Yes, sire."
"Oh, what have I done?"
What have I done?
- Has he kissed heryet?
- Not yet.
Oh'
"Oh,Judy'"
Yo' Flounder' Any kissing?
"No, not yet."
Hmm.
"Well, they'd-- they'd better get crackin"""
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.
"Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once."
"Okay, all right, this calls for... a little vocal romantic stimulation."
Stand back'
Wow.
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
"Oh' Geez, man."
I'm surrounded by amateurs.
"You want something done, you've got to do it yourself."
"As fast as possible,"
And leave before they get there.
The thought had crossed my mind.
(mace:)it looks like da veiga
Was working with sydney fox.
I can't wait to see rennes' face
When I tell him.
And I'd have you to thank.
For delivering your father to me.
Why did you betray him?
"Was it power,"
Money?
(mace:)they've used
The empty case as a decoy.
Where is the dagger
And the scabbard?
Don't be stupid.
Tell me.
Or I'll turn you over to him.
That must be karen.
Ahh...
Sorry I'm late.
I found the druid's noch
On an ancient roman map.
And I brought you those crumpets
That you like from marks and spencer.
"Thank you, karen, you're an angel."
You owe me five quid.
The noch was a small hill
That was significant as a place
Of worship for druids
In wales 2000 years ago.
- I have to finish here first.
- It's OK.
I can come back later.
- Selfish bastard!
- Cunt!
- Your costumes are just magnifique.
- Thank you.
"You can come a long way in France, with the right support."
"I feel I see who you are and what you need, you know?"
- I'm not quite sure I do.
- I could make you very successful.
- A very happy woman.
"- Thanks, but I'm doing fine."
I think you should start trusting your feelings.
Like we do in Paris.
What feelings?
You don't know who I am!
You cunt!
You loser...
Merde!
(wistful guitar music)
(busy signal)
(wistful guitar music)
(Camilla singing badly)
I thought we'd talked about you using my bathrobe.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't.
- If you insist.
(light pop music)
Sit down!
- You can keep it on for now.
"- Sit down, please."
Sit down.
Touch me.
"Oh, no."
[whispers]:
Human contact...
that's how you show empathy.
Oh!
How is the back of your hand clammy?
"All right, lightning round."
[buzzer sounds]
So there's no future for us?
"Well, I don't know what you're up to, but I'm going to Burger King after this."
[buzzer sounds]
I thought we had something.
We did have something.
A one-night stand.
[buzzer sounds]
Is there someone else?
There's everyone else.
[buzzer sounds repeatedly]
"Oh, my God!"
"I have been trying to help you for hours, and at best, you have made zero progress."
It is like you are incapable of caring.
Maybe I was right: you are a monster.
Wow.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I can tell how frustrating this is for you.
"No, I don't think you..."
"Wait, what did you just say?"
"Um, I'm sorry?"
Jack!
You cared about how I felt!
That's empathy!
- A retarded woman in her thirties.
I didn't notice she was retarded so we went back to her parents' place.
I overlooked certain telltale signs.
"""It's okay with my mum and dad."" The Bambi poster in her room."
"Anyway, don't tell anyone."
People have a hard time with it.
And sex!
Imagine the uproar.
"I didn't know, and the sex was fine."
- The sex was fine?
Very interesting.
"- Her boobs weren't retarded, okay?"
I prefer a retard with good boobs over a bright girl with stupid boobs.
That's where you eat and sing and read and so on.
"- Nice, isn't?"
- Indeed.
WELCOME BODIL
"The room needs to be furnished, but..."
Look.
Your idea?
Super.
What a nice... square room.
I'd like a moment alone with Bodil.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
- I painted it.
- Isn't that nice?
- I painted it with my mouth.
- You painted that with your mouth?
- Yes.
"You had to throw it out, didn't you?"
"Of all the junk in here, you had to throw out the one cask of wine to be shot to pieces?"
Well done.
"""Easy missions, well earned"", Porthos."
(WHINNYING)
(GRUNTS)
ATHOS:
Cadets!
Time to go!
Grimaud certainly left his mark on you.
"Getting caught unarmed and unawares, doesn't sound like you?"
A mistake I will not make again.
We ride hard.
(CADETS URGING HORSE)
It's eight hours until dark and what is it?
Four shot balls left.
"Eight hours, four shot balls, not the most encouraging number."
"Besides, they're not going to let us live until dark."
- (GUNSHOT)
- That would just be stupid.
(GUNSHOTS)
D'Artagnan!
- (GUNSHOT) - (MAN GROANS)
Come on.
Come on.
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)
The last thing they're expecting is for one of us to go out that door.
(LAUGHS)
Because that would be suicide.
Cover me.
(GRUNTING)
PORTHOS:
Very well.
Striking a superior is a court-martial offence.
Corporal Dawes says that he started it.
"So, I want to find out what really happened."
You go back under close arrest.
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Private McKendrick, about turn!"
"Give me his service record, Sergeant Major."
"Yes, Sir."
"Angry man, that one."
"Some get that out of them, Sir."
Anger's good sometimes in a fighting soldier.
Properly directed.
Are you suggesting that he be given special treatment?
"On the contrary, Sergeant Major."
Let me see now.
Enlisted Montreal.
Place of birth...
Los Angeles.
"Anything else, Sir?"
College two years.
"Profession, just says ""aircraft industry"", that's all."
"Any previous military experience, Sir?"
None listed.
"Pretty vague, huh?"
I suppose when you're short of men you don't ask questions.
Ask the security boys to run a special check on him.
"Yes, Sir."
He interests me.
"Hi, there."
"No prison pallor, I see."
"What's this, Ladies Rehabilitation Society?"
MAX:
"Oh, nonsense."
I also collected some crickets and caterpillars for our dining pleasure.
They're an excellent source of protein.
I grabbed what I could... before our ship burnt up.
"If we ration it, could last us a few days."
"Talk to me, what do we have?"
(sighs)
Mochi balls.
Love those.
And a bottle of ouzo.
Who's up for some sing-a-longs?
MAX:
That sounds delightful.
"Sorry, cuz."
"If I die first,"
I want you to eat me.
Nobody's gonna eat you.
"So what are you saying, I'm not good enough for you?"
Why wouldn't you eat me?
"Guys, over here!"
"Check it out,"
"Doctor, regular MacGyver."
"Actually, it's basic physics."
The lens focuses the light to generate enough heat to burn.
Now all we need to do is stoke the flame.
"I'll do you one better, brah."
Oh!
- Yeah!
Whoa.
It's always nice to have flammable material.
FLIPPA:
I want to see this.
"You coming, Quute?"
"- What about the tunnel, sir?"
- Blow every charge now.
(Beeping)
"You were right, Tarrant."
That was the monorail.
Let's move.
Put down your guns.
Servalan!
Now!
"You see, I told you, Quute."
"They're marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
She got away.
"It was Servalan, wasn't it?"
"Well, we both saw her, and she seemed to recognise us."
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're ready for teleport.
About time.
Stand by to teleport.
"Slave, where are those cruisers now?"
"Sector 12, Master."
You outmanoeuvred them with consummate skill.
Thank you.
"Set a direct course for base, maximum speed."
Teleport operating.
What are you smirking about?
Do you realise we've got half the Federation battle fleet looking for us?
"The next time either of you pull a stunt like that, I warn you it may prove fatal."
We've just seen an old friend of yours.
- An implacable old friend.
- Servalan.
Absurd?
"The spirits of my ancestors are with me always, Sam."
Are you calling them absurd?
"No, absolutely not, sir."
I meant no disrespect.
It's just...
"Either way, it's bad luck to gamble under the same roof as a restless spirit."
Good-bye.
Let's go.
Mr. Wu?
Wow.
Looks like your ace just folded.
Gotta hand it to Monica.
What?
Even death can't keep that bitch from ruining my life.
"Hey, check that out."
Camera R29.
It keeps flicking on and off.
Maybe it's a monitor problem.
Can you switch the feed?
Yep.
"Nope, looks like it's the camera."
Isn't that about where Monica flew off the...
"What, you think maybe her ghost is trying to communicate with us?"
Like Morse code?
"Short, short, long..."
"That's ""Mike."""
"Short, long, long, long...""Is."""
"""Mike is going to die."""
That's very funny.
"Whoo, yeah."
- Why don't you go check it out?
-
"- Oh, aye."
Nothing to choose between them!
"Then I thought, ""Colour the hair, Granville."
"-- ""Get into colour."
"Loads of colour."" -"
- They're not really great legs.
"Then I thought, ""Maybe"" -- and I'd appreciate a second opinion --"
"""Maybe something plain."
"Severe, even."
"""Something discreet, in the shape of a single earring?"""
"Oh, yeah!"
Yeah.
Isn't that lovely?
"Oh, d--dear!"
Look at her!
That's the k--kind of advertising we need!
-
- Have you got any copper?
-
"- Oh, yes."
"One pound, thank you."
There we are!
"I'm making a study of the adverts in these glossy magazines, Granville."
There are two things that stand out.
Her two things c--certainly stand out!
But where are we going to get someone like that round here with these qualifications?
"No, who would d--dress in a c--costume like that and p--p--pose like that?"
-- (TILL BANGS) -
- Aghh!
"Oh, dear."
He'll never get the hang of that!
[gun shots]
Watch your back.
Right.
Cover me!
[gun shots]
The other two got away.
They got andreas.
Edward mace is unrelenting and ruthless.
When he discovers he doesn't
"Have what he came for,"
He will be back with a vengeance.
Where will they take andreas?
To the darkest place on earth.
I have to go after them.
(nigel:)let's see what we've got here.
The scabbard has holes along its length
That coincide with words written
On the inside of the blade.
Makes up a latin phrase.
"""from sarsen stone, 240 peds,"
"Beneath the druid's noch."""
"(syd:) ""peds."""
Is a roman measurement common to the time.
"Yeah, the stride of an average man."
It would have been about
Five-foot-two in those days.
Sarsen.
"Sarsen is a type of limestone,"
Indigenous to south- central England.
"Also known as greywether,"
Or druidstone.
It's what stonehenge is made of.
"Don't sell it, you owe us."
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
- Find anything?
"- No, nothing."
In the well?
Garbage.
"Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak."
Abelardo!
"Abelardo, come here!"
Carmen.
Estrellla.
"Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook."
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile.
All together so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
"No, leave it there."
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
"""Apart from the breasts..."
"""Several cuts, apparently stab wounds."
"First degree burn on the left hand."""
Let's move to the other body.
"Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax."
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
Say it again in Japanese if you dare
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
"Come on, guys!"
Faster!
Tado!
"Baso, kill him!"
I'm holding down his feet!
Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop!
All of you!
What is it?
What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop!
Stop!
Yoshi...
Yoshimura
You're in big trouble
You have the nerve to beat me up
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us!
Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all
"Let's do it, Father, before the Japanese kill us all"
Why the hell did you provoke him when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds that can only chase and hunt and know nothing of self-restraint
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
Instantly regretted.
- Where did you learn that phrase?
"- It's true, sir."
"Threatening officers is serious, but given your clean sheet I'll be lenient."
Two dozen lashes.
- I said six.
- March him out.
Right turn.
Forward march.
There were many people who heard me say six.
It was not your decision to make.
- Did you take note of that phrase?
"- Phrase, sir?"
"""An impulse, instantly regretted."""
It may mean nothing.
"But in my opinion, he'd been drilled in it."
"- Drilled, sir?"
By whom?
- I wish I knew.
- He remembered his piece.
"- It didn't save him, did it?"
It helped.
Only two dozen.
Scott-Padget must have nigh run mad.
- You know what two dozen means?
- Shut your mouth.
It means a soft captain.
My old captain on the Swift he never gave less than six dozen.
"Yes, that's what he gave me."
Six dozen.
Look here!
All hands on deck to witness punishment!
He has the sight problem.
Prestige problem to wear spectacles.
Where is your husband?
He has the ego problem.
He doesn't come unless called.
Hubby!

Why are you shouting?
Do you think I am deaf?
I have not thought so.
- Why are you shouting then?
Tell me.
Cool brother-in-law..
How dare you touch me?
Am I your brother-in-law  [Informal] ?
I am your brother-in-law  [Formal] .
"If you can touch me, I will kick you off.."
Who are you all?
Have you come for donations?
"No sir, we came on an important work with you,"
What is that?
Look at this once.
What is this dark angle?
From how long is this going on?
Tell me how long is this happening?
"Do not hit brother-in-law, sister is like fire."
- [bleats]
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
- Want me to tell you how safe?
- [Alfred bleating]
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month,"
They're gonna give me a gold safety award.
- What do you think of that?
- [bleating]
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
- I sure hope you're a good tipper.
- [bleats]
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
[tires screeching]
[cabbie] hey!
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
[cabbie sighs]
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh...
Record.
Let's go for a walk.
"Oh, thanks."
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin
It's this dumb cane.
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Do you want to ruin something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
something for me?
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
Maybe that would cheer you up.
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of"
"Oh,no."
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know,"
"Imean,Ibelievealot of really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
"really dumb stuff, you know, like pop rocks and Coke?"
That's dangerous.
like pop rocks and Coke?
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
That's dangerous.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"You know, and the moon landing?"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I--"
Never happened.
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood"
"And also the Illuminati, I-- I'mreallynotinthemood right now."
I'mreallynotinthemood right now.
"By the way, do you have any papers?"
No.
Lock him up.
Your information proved to be correct.
The man had very considerable assets.
This is enough money for your fare.
This is a passport to America.
You are now a French citizen.
The man you caught will never know about this?
You mean your brother?
He will never know.
Did anything happen to him?
He resisted my men.
He died.
He died?
Yes.
It was one of those unfortunate things.
Your first look?
"Yes, I had only seen pictures before."
It's a big country.
Millions of people beyond those buildings.
"All of them needing something, buying something."
And what do you sell them?
Oil.
"Oh, oil."
Are you an honest man?
What kind of a question is that?
I don't see anything wrong with the question.
Did you make your way honestly?
Of course I did.
Isn't that the only way?
Is it?
You're the murderer the whole empire is out looking for!
"Well, then."
I will go and prepare your dinner now.
The count was really depressed.
Do you suppose he feels responsible?
Is this really a good idea?
Is what?
"Well, the count, he most likely thinks of her as-"
"Yes, he seems to like her!"
And you don't care?
!
Is there something wrong with that?
Asta-san!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
I should've minded my own business!
Your Lordship?
Where are you going?
To find Radu.
You mustn't!
"Out of my way, Terran!"
Why are you so adamant?
!
Eh?
Is there something wrong with me finding Radu and keeping him from assassinating Her Majesty?
!
Your Lordship!
Are you suggesting I want the empress to be assassinated?
!
I'm just...
"I'm just some deplorable, blood-starved monster to you, anyway!"
That's not true!
"- You make up for that, then!"
-
- Hmm?
-
- Don't know what you mean.
-
- Listening to the gossip!
I can't help overhearing a certain amount.
Over--over--overhearing?
!
Your lugs were f--flapping about like radar!
There was me with me arms windmilling about trying to persuade you to m--make a sale.
"Oh, is that what you were doing?"
Making a sail for your windmill.
A sail for your w...
Aghh!
Ow!
-
"- Now, you're g--g--going to get on with it."
-
- What are you doing with that lad's ear?
It's the only place to handle s--small dogs and errand boys.
"With due regard to the conventions, where else would I take hold of an errand boy?"
Poor lad!
You've made it all red.
-
- It feels longer.
Is it longer?
-
- You leave him alone.
"He's got very shapely, delicate, small ears."
"""Delicate""?"
"- Before you picked me, you didn't tell?"
- No.
- I always assumed...
- No.
Well... .
Let's go see our boss.
- Hey.
- How was the NGA?
"Oh, you know the governors, too many mandates, too little money."
- I can hear that one at home.
- Good one.
- The governors liked it.
- Yeah.
Have you announced for the governor of New Jersey bill?
- Excuse me?
- Did I miss an announcement?
That's three years away.
I'm trying to serve...
I never heard of these loans.
So I'm assuming it's a campaign proposal.
Camden and Newark will go nuts.
I know it's not national.
- Give me a break.
- Know how I know?
National programs are announced by the president unless this White House passes on them first.
"Toby, this is a nickel-and-dime program."
Calm down.
Right.
We're announcing a new replacement for Social Security...
- I thought we were...
- They're not your nickels.
- They're not your dimes!
They never take their eyes off it.
I heard your man telling you it was full of old documents.
"Well, that's not so."
"You see, a lot of documents is a lot of paper."
And paper's heavy.
But they lift that box as if it's as light as a feather... sir.
"Take him out, Tongue."
"- What's French for ""keep out"", Harris?"
"- Défense d'entrer, sir."
Right.
Come with me.
"Say a short prayer, Tongue."
Yea...
I say yea.
Yea.

Why is that colonel chasing you?
He's chasing you
A full troop of French cavalry?

"No, they're after you."
Why?
Because of what's in that chest
Why?
Because that chest is full of papers and the colonel is a great reader?
That's why?

I'm upset with myself.

He tell you?
Briefly.
No need for more.
It would be dangerous.
For you and us.
I thought it over.
You're partially right.
Militancy is getting us nowhere.
Bourgeoise elections even less.
It's a trap.
It's time for action.
No revolution ever avoided it.
French resistance took up arms.
We extol their heroism.
We're the new resistance.
Don't Maoists say that?
Maybe they're right.
So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.
Where do you position yourself?
Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it?
It's easy.

Sir... you...?
We must check your computer
What is your password?
Why sir...?
He wants to know your password
Saraswati.
What...?
Saraswati.
Our mother's name
Our suspicion is true.
The papers were stolen by Jagadish's computer
Atul...
Did Jagadish use this computer to give you the question papers?
Why did you have to do this?
Someone tell me what he has done.
- I'll tell you Mrs Batra
Jagadish used his computer... just like a burglar who enters homes and steals
"Stop, you're tickling my ear"
Your cheek's all red
- Where would I get make-up?
- From Claire's.
"Later, I'll tell you a terrible secret about Charles"
"Ah yes, what secret?"
Go ask her to dance
I don't know how to dance
"Neither does she, go on"
I can't dance
I want to
"You dance terrific, like in the movies"
Is this what the priests teach you in school?
It's the last bottle
The Mayor wants a word.
He refused to go away
He can return tomorrow when Edward is here
He insists
I'll see him
Save a little champagne.
I shall surely be needing it
"Wait, I'm really thirsty"
That's the rhythm
84.
Want to dance?
She doesn't know how
Time to learn.
Shall we try?
I don't want to anymore
Just when I was getting good
That was the Mayor
He wants extravagant payment
Yes.
And I am to renounce all claims on the contents of the tomb?
Yes.
"Duplicate pieces that the Cairo Museum feel they can spare will, of course, be ceded to you."
"At the discretion of Monsieur Lacau, I suppose."
I will do everything in my power to make sure that you receive a fair selection.
My husband would have wanted you to return to your work.
Will Mr Mace be returning to Egypt?
"I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
Mace died recently.
"Oh, dear."
I'm so sorry.
I expect the newspapers will say he is another victim of the curse of Tutankhamun.
Arthur always laughed at the idea.
There are times when I wonder.
(Shouting instructions in Arabic)
(Speaking Arabic)
Lift.
Stop.
Stop!
"You, stop."
"You, stop."
"You, lift."
"You, start."
Everyone.
That's good.
Very nice.
Good.
"Okay, let's get the planks in."
Planks in.
Good.
And lower.
- ...
I'm arresting you on suspicion
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!
"You do not have to say anything, but if you do not mention..."
Agh!
Help!
(SHRIEKS) Help!
What did I do?
Didn't find any drugs!
"Search me, I don't take drugs."
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?
- (MOBILE BUZZES)
- Can you shut up for one second?
- I'm clean!
I'm clean!
I'm clean!
- Justin.
Did you get a beat on that DNA?
"Er, yeah."
"Cameron Pell, artist."
"Well, failed artist."
A history of mental illness?
No.
The man's got serious issues.
Five years back he was arrested for gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.
"He's burst in wearing a clown mask, slashed a load of paintings with a flensing knife."
"When they tried to throw him out, he's gone completely Tonto."
Cut up two doormen.
Lucky to escape an attempted murder charge.
- Right.
- When did she lose her pulse?
- Never had one.
- Everybody.
On my count.
One-
- Hold transfer and compressions!
- Asystole!
- Abdomen's distended.
Pelvic instability.
Suction on high.
I need a Yankauer.
That's easily two liters.
"All right, amp of epi."
Don't bother.
Obvious C-spine fracture.
She's not even a good organ donor now.
- Is her family here?
- Trying to locate them.
- We can talk to them...
- It's fine.
Just let me know when they arrive.
...if it'd be easier for you.
I could pull the trigger right now if I wanted to.
Because it's all right here.
"Welcome back, Elizabeth."
Do you have time for a consult?
"As it turns out, yes."
What's he have?
Belly pain?
Only because he swallowed a handful of nitroglycerin.
No sudden moves unless you want me to blow!
Milo has right upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.
You can remain seated.
"It is nothing, only a little exhaustion."
-Then?
-You are well.
"And that there is of the fatigue, lack of appetite and all that?"
"One does not worry, take this and you will feel better."
Good morning.
-What do you want?
-Sandro is in the house?
"-No, in fact, there is nobody."
"-In agreement, tell him that we will return."
"You hear, dear colleague, it would be better to wait for him here."
I do not know if they would have...
"Young lady, I am Prof. Moroni, educational of ""Endocrinoginecologentropia"","
-my assistant Dr. Ognissanti.
"-Yes, we are very important."
"-Come in, come in, please."
-Thanks.
Thanks.
Please.
"Sit down, professor."
Can I get you anything?
Whisky.
JB.
-What you want to do?
-You have seen that good she is?
"-Who, the chambermaid?"
"-Handsome, young, ingenuous, ebullient..."
-The lady is not.
-She is not...
-She does not know you...
-She does not know me...
"- I was just making the point, sir, that you've been screwing every girl in here with your eyes since we arrived, which suggests that sex ranks higher than substance."
"And I'll pass, thanks."
"You see, I don't really find intellectual thrust that sexy..."
"Or fake tan, for that matter."
"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?"
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.
"The thing is, I don't actually have to put up..."
OK.
Cool.
See you!
I think you should join her.
"Don't you, Tony?"
Toodle-oo.
You.
You really fucked up in there.
I really fucked up?
"Wait, what are you even doing here, anyway?"
Same thing you are.
Wow!
Check it out.
Ah...
Shall we?
No.
No way.
"First of all,"
I can't really swim very well any more and secondly...
"Ahh, boo-hoo."
What the fuck?
!
"I told you, I can't..."
I can't...
Goodbye.
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.
- She is weak... timid.
Narcissistically concerned with petty trivialities.
Unable to express her true self.
- And do you wish to return to your life as Isabel?
- No.
I have to forget I was ever such a vapid creature.
- Very good.
You are tabula rasa incarnate.
Do you understand the significance of what we've achieved?
"- Yes, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
- You are ready for your new identity.
"- Hello, good man."
"I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but is Mr. Baxter in?"
- No.
I'm sorry.
He's out.
"Was he expecting you, Mr..."
"- No, sir."
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.
- My apologies.
Perhaps you could call on him another time?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
"- My sweet, pretty wife."
"Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"
- More.
Your Faith doubts you.
- Then God bless you.
"You jerk, when dad comes home"
See if you can still live!
"No, I won't dare next time!"
Maybe I'll let you touch me and we can get even!
You deserve it
He teases you!
"Huh, does that amuse you?"
"Blockhead, I guess you need a good beating"
How dare you tease your brother?
Brother!
Big Brother
That blockhead didn't respect me
Don't you think he deserves a good beat?
Forget it and continue practicing
Otherwise Master will blame us when he returns
What are you looking at?
Want a good beat?
Gao Jian!
He pretends not to hear you!
Gao Jian!
What's the matter?
Bring me two stone weights!
You can get it yourself
"I'm your elder, you should do atleast obey"
"That's right, get it quick!"
What a chicken!
And he wants to learn martial arts
He is good in bed.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Quick!
"Gao Jian, kneel down!"
- Who'll know?
Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
"Oh, not you!"
Forget it.
- Squire?
What squire?
- You know what squire.
"Oh, my rheumatism."
That cell was so damp.
Two whole nights.
"Oh, you poor dear."
"Come, let me undress you and put you to bed."
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
"Oh, Betty."
Your hands are so soft and warm.
"You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?"
- Well...
- Do you?
"Come, let me take those off."
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
"Bernard, my darling."
Come.
Citizens nobles gentry!
The king.
Me?
"Oh, yes."
"Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour."
"And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate to meet it face to face in hand-to-hand combat."
Brother.
Grandma isn't there!
These...
They're Grandpa's clothes.
But why spread them out like this?
The clock in Grandma's head is running in reverse.
"So now, she is slipping back to the time of Grandpa."
Hello!
Yes?
"Just a little while ago, your Grandma came to my place."
Then... she saw the clouds and took off in a hurry.
She was headed for Nagasaki.
Today's clouds... look exactly like they did on that day.
Maybe she remembered what happened on that day.
"No, I mean, she thinks she's reliving that day."
Grandma!
Grandma!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field

AVON:
Tarrant!
Tarrant!
Listen...
Let's go.
- Tarrant!
Tarrant!
"- It's no use, he's cut off."
- Damn.
"- Well, that is it."
"With those ships out there, we can't wait."
They might not be looking for us.
Are you crazy?
You said yourself that was a search formation.
"They haven't picked up Tarrant, so why have they assumed a ship's out here?"
Just a minute.
"Orac, that message from Space Centre, how was it relayed here?"
Through Terminal 4006.
- The terminal on Helotrix.
"- Of course, Avon."
- That is the nearest terminal to our position.
- That's it.
They must have intercepted the transmission.
Computer logic.
The nearest terminal.
"So Orac's thick, we all know that."
Let's move!
- I'm going in under them.
- What?
We'll go down to cloud level.
"If we stay between them and the planet, we may not show up on their scanners."
Once we're below them we'll be cut off.
"Today, Supreme Allied headquarters reported American combat troops and aircraft have completely routed the attacking German army at the Ardennes front."
"American troops have discovered the frozen corpses of over 70 fellow GIs, taken prisoner then fiendishly executed by their German captors."
Investigating officers at the nightmarish scene say the massacre happened at a small crossroads near the Belgian town of Malmedy.
"General Eisenhower has vowed that upon war's end, all German officers and soldiers responsible for this unspeakable act will be vigorously tried for war crimes and swiftly punished."
"This is Armed Forces Radio, London."
"Ah, cigarettes."
What is this?
My wife.
You speak German?
Hmm.
Please...
Here.
Thanks.
Halt!
Halt!
Out!
Out!
Now!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I surrender!
"Get down, get down low."
Hello!
Is anyone home?
Come in.
It's cold in here.
Light the stove.
Ach!
It's foul.
Not like mom's house.
"Yeah, a little louder."
I do not ...
"As long as you practice hard, a year later"
You'll be another Jin Tianyun
"Brother Jin, you're not recovered yet"
Those gangs are still looking for you
As long as they didn't find my body
They will not give up
Sooner or later they will be here
"I know, you're afraid of involving me"
"Brother Jin, we're good brothers"
"We should share everything, be it joy or sorrow"
"Jian, nothing will last forever"
I'll come to see you a year later
"Okay, Brother Jin, by that time"
I'll take good care of you
You mean the rice of original taste?
"Daixiong, give it a try!"
-Me!
"-Y es, master"
Master!
Got it!
"Okay, okay!"
"Ying Chang, it's your turn!"
Me?
No way!
"3rd Brother, if you don't want to learn from dad"
You can leave here!
I didn't mean that!
Then go practice!
Alright!
"Master, which stance?"
As you wish
Whatever!
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?
No.
"You're like me, then."
Floundering in wet shit.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?

"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
He is a murder
He has been punish
He just payed for his doing's
Father forgive brother please
Come father
The punishment I already got for my misdeed's
Please let the enemy between both family's end.
My enemy has to be dead
Did you understand
Don't spare him Kill him
Can change any colour but black will always remain black
Rughnath he is out of my reach.
And away from my life.
Shiv listen to me I only have 1 son.
And you go away'
In this village there is no place for you.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
"Okay, go."
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
"Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?"
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
"After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route."
"After reaching the outskirts,"
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
"Hit him then, and push him off the car."
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
tomorrow?
"No, it's today!"
Better call the station.
"Wait, stop!"
How will we explain this situation?
"If they find out about us, you may have to quit."
Word will spread quickly.
So only I suffer?
I guess your post is safe.
"It'll be bad for me, too."
But your wife's the daughter of the deputy director.
"You may have to get a divorce, too."
Fine.
Then you leave first.
I'll report this after you leave.
Look!
Someone was killed!
"Silly, she was just on her period."
So dark.
Apparently it was a murder.
Where?
The hotel next door.
It's a mess with police and ambulances.
Our customers can't come and go with all that tape.
"Suzuki San, could you man the front desk?"
Sure.
"Hey, you can't go in, stay back!"
"Okay, okay."
Looks awful.
Who was killed?
That streetwalker.
"A price dispute with a customer... led to the killing, apparently."
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.
Yeah.
"I mean, totally."
What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.
Cool.
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.
Whoa.
That...
That sounds crazy.
Can't wait!
I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net."
Hmm.
"Name could use a little work, I think."
It's all 90s.
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.
- Whoa!
- Are you ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Beam me up.
"Here we go, lock and load."
- Eyes closed.
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.
It's uploading.
"Five, four, three, two, one."
How are you feeling?
Um...
#Lap me up
# Why don't you come on and lap me up... #
All right?
#...
Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches... #
All right?
#...
"Well, there goes another one Just lying down on the sand dunes"
#I'd better go take a swim and see If I can cool down a little bit... #
"- It's hot in here, isn't it?"
"- Yeah, it's quite hot in here."
#...
Things on our minds You know what I mean... #
Um... hi.
"I wonder if you could help us, please."
We're looking for a...
"Hey, do you want to head outside, get some fresh air?"
#...
Looking at the peaches... #
- All right.
- #...
Just take a look over there... #
"- No, I haven't."
- Um... #...
Is she trying to get out of that clitoris?
#Liberation for women That's what I preach
#Preacher man... #
Are you OK?
#...
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches... #
Here we are.

I just picked up our little man and thought we'd drop by for a visit.
I've been trying to get Fen interested in food.
She shows a passing interest in oatmeal.
- (Fen grunting) - (Murdoch):
Any other changes?
"She's still making the gestures, but I haven't been able to decipher any pattern."
It certainly doesn't match any sign language that I can find.
(Murdoch):
Perhaps it is just random.
- (baby babbling)
"- Hello, Roland."
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)
- Oh!
- The nanny says that
- we are to feed him more often.
- Hahaha!
"- He's hardly underfed, William."
"- I agree, but she insists."
There.
No?
"See, you're not even hungry."
(Fen grunting)
"Do you see that, William?"
(Fen grunting)
You like the baby?
- You want to see the baby?
- (Fen grunting)
"I think she's more interested in you, William."
Pa!
- She's speaking.
- Paaa!
"still, I am content."
I've seen you at last.
And I am delighted to find you're not a man at all.
You're an angel.
"Hands, halo, wings... everything."
"Good night, my dream."
"My poor lady, you are a wreck."
I am a resurrected wreck.
Move over.
(grunting)
"Citizen Maurice, the prisoner is ready for execution."
"Viscount de Swamp, you are guilty of crimes against the people of France."
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
To the guillotine!
The king has escaped!
- Catch him!
- I will!
Tyrant!
You will be brought to justice.
- Long live the republic!
- (gunshot)
- The king's guard!
We're surrounded.
- We'II hold the king as hostage.
We'II shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?
- I don't think so.
- I can help you.
- My papa's got plenty of gunpowder.
- This could be very useful.
(girl) beautiful!
Take it‎!
I do not want to be the one chosen‎.
That would be very unfair‎.
It's simple‎.
"Now‎, if you do not want to consider my offer ‎.‎.‎."
I can kill all the a trip or push them until they do‎.
Very well‎.
"Well‎, Mitchell‎."
Move us‎.
"Mitchell‎, vamos andando‎."
Say prayer‎.
‎
"- Amen‎, Sergeant‎!"
‎
- Amen‎.
What is happening‎?
Last night the Germans blew up the bridge‎.
They flew around the area‎.
They have engineers working on repairs‎.
And the rest of the convoy‎?
"We let them take risks‎, but the last to cross ‎.‎.‎."
got caught between the bridge and the river‎.
Luckily no one died‎.
It will take all day to repair that bridge‎.
So what do we do‎?
You have to take the 520‎.
That is why Saint Andreasberg‎.
It has a small bridge where you can cross‎.
And how far is that‎?
About 20 miles‎.
It's like an hour‎.
You better wait here‎.
Someone's helping these guys.
"I mean, maybe unfreezing 'em."
It's like when captain America was trapped in the Antarctic ice...
Doc.
Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean, Lex Luthor."
Case in point.
"Hey, psycho."
"Hey, psycho."
What's up?
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.
I got nine lives.
Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh, right."
"Well, uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or Bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.
But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.
Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah, most of these whack jobs add ball bearings, nails, whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.
"You mind if I, uh..."
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
Wait a bit.
- How much do you charge?
- Let go of me!
Fuck.
- That's what I'm asking about.
- Go eat shit.
Alright.
- So what are you doing right now?
"- Nothing, nothing."
There's some boys that need a medic.
- Come with me.
- I didn't finish my studies.
"If you don't say anything then I won't either, alright?"
Come.
- Jimmy!
- I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop along the way.
Pasqualino's coming too.
Let's go!
"As you can see, the interior of Vesuvius isn't dormant."
"And examining the seismographs, we can see that activity... has increased in recent weeks."
- Does that always happen?
- Absolutely not.
This is the first time I see this phenomenon.
- Strange...
- Yes.
"Maria, we..."
"Excuse me, one moment."
Maria!
Where are you going?
What about the picnic?
Tell my father we're going to see the nuns.
I know that crowd.
Watch out or they'll get him into trouble.
You understand?
"Tomorrow evening, you say?"
Is Biberkopf really coming with us?
Of course.
Why not?
"One bale of cheviot, 75.29."
"One half bale of worsted, 75.64."
"One bale of cheviot, 75.66."
- How many bales are missing in total?
- Just a moment.
"My wife said just yesterday, ""No one can get through that door!"""
So they came through the roof!
- The very best English cloth!
These men clearly have no sense of patriotism!
The very best English cloth!
The very best English cloth.
"I certainly hope so, or I'm conning myself."
That tickles!
No nonsense!
I'll send for my old things later.
"Mieze, come and be amazed."
What do you think?
- Very smart!
Clothes make the man.
Now it's your turn.
No!
Don't be so silly!
Business is good.
We can afford decent clothes now.
Right?
-I have nothing to tell!
-Impossible!
"At least something real, at most a dream."
Do you think it is nothing?
The dreams are part of the reality.
Is this the only reality?
-Then it will let me go?
I see.
"Then you, wherever you want."
"Well, I dreamt, that I went to a shoeshop with my boyfriend."
"Is this the story, which I interpreted?"
"Yes of course, you deserve it."
It was the most wonderful shoeshop ever seen.
There was no customer.
"Only a few women dummies, a shoeshine black... and the owner of the business."
I would like some red boots!
"Suddenly I realised, that the owner was you."
Your final fulfilment.
As you would have expected.
Run along.
"-Yes, master."
"But, Lucia!"
What are you doing?
Don't you you see?
I am with Tinto Brass.
"Aye, director!"
Ripped by elcodigo and retranslated
We need this completely filled.
We don't have time to haggle over price.
Understood.
Captain.
- No fear or favour.
How about Mr. Crawford?
How does he take it?
- I've not had occasion...
- Not had occasion?
"He's made of good stuff, he must be spirited."
"Therefore, he must get into mischief."
"If he gets into mischief, he must be punished."
The captain insisted on no favouritism.
- You heard him say that.
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, be watchful, Mr. Kilpatrick."
- And diligent.
"- Yes, sir."
"And if you ever need my advice, don't hesitate to ask."
"Thank you, sir."
"- Don't lie, son."
"- I didn't do it, sir."
- Are those your initials?
"- Yes, but I just made a scratch."
- You could hardly see it.
- You did?
- You lied to me.
- I thought...
- It's so marked-up anyway.
- It shouldn't be.
There's a rule against defacing the table.
I've been lenient with you.
Too lenient.
- Anything to say?
- Only that someone else must have...
- I have nothing to say.
- Welcome home
- Thanks
What's that?
It was just lying there
Someone was in a hurry
"I'm home, baby"
Can you hear?
Hirano san...
Are you all right?
Do you have a stomach ache?
Hirano san...
"Hey, Sada san!"
Look what a mess you made of the floor The landlord won't like this
"Get a doctor, quick!"
"He'll be fine, it's the third time And the sword's bamboo"
He tries to commit hara-kiri every spring
- Pathetic
- Ouch
"Listen, if you do this on the floor, it's a pain in the neck to clean up"
"If you must, do it on the dirt floor"
Answer me
"Oh, no!"
"Soza san, please get Dr. Onodera"
Soza san
What a bunch of hopeless losers...
Bamboo...
Osae san...
Thank you
I could've sworn he was taller
Enough of your stories
Give me the money
Money?
"You have a religion, you?"
Noo!
"Remember, it's for you."
At least you do not kill.
My woman ...
"My cross, my skin."
Want something else?
Disappear before you do a gift pack of all!
- I will go to seek it!
"- Not tired, she's already here!"
All done.
Protect yourself.
"From him, from me."
"Impediscimi to empty, to sink."
Tappami ...
Nooo!
Leave decant things ...
Life is beautiful ...
Can you hear me?
Smell.
They wet the road for fuck sull'asfalto.

But nothing compares to what has
Happened to me on the inside.
"All those days facing death,"
I came to realize that
Nothing mattered more to me...
Than you.
[âª]
Hello.
These symbols may very well describe
I will destroy the jedi.
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
You are no longer my apprentice.
And now you shall die.
"Thank you, Artoo."
That's quite enough.
"Ventress, you're not looking well."
She never does.
"You have failed, Ventress, surrender."
Never.
"Yes, my lord."
Ventress is battling the jedi on board the command ship.
Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire.
"But, my lord,"
"I calculate that will destroy, Ventress, the jedi, and all our forces."
Precisely.
- We're in position.
- Open fire.
That is correct.
Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar.
It's over.
"Anakin, look out!"
We have to get out of here.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
The command ship has been destroyed.
Our scanning indicates there are no survivors.
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.

There are better machines!
"Without us, they have no future."
They were built for and by us!
"They are not our children, they are slaves."
Our survival depends on extermination!
"Open your eyes, Bishop!"
"We are surrounded by ice, this planet is dead!"
There are not enough resources to pick them up these days.
Would you choose those of your own kind?
If this is what we will become  then yes!
I choose them.
Your new rank is JMATR!
FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION!
After your Spartan body.
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot!"
Also know as...
"Goodbye, motherfuckers."
Kill him!
What the...?
Something is wrong with the weapons Malfunction!
"Malfunction of the weapon, sir!"
"Welcome to the area of death, idiots!"
Come on!
Kill these weak heads!
What happens to you?
Come on!
This is not over yet!
You come to my death list!
I will hunt you personally!
Then...
You will fall in love eventually.
Anyway...
The only one...
I am the only one you can love.
Not even a kiss for your fiancé?
This is quite a strange beginning.
"Hi, good evening."
Glad you could make it.
"Hi, welcome."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Everyone...

Will step off the train
And step through those doors.

- Chill and Ace.

- I don't know.
Maybe it's the pig.
"They're in the bedroom or outside, till I've finished this."
"The dogs are used to the hash fumes, and suddenly you kick them out."
So they feel bad.

Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
"Thanks, doctor."
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
"Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease."
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
"- There's nothing to think about, doctor."
If Varun can get his sight back...
"Are we ready, Baron of Luxor?"
Everything is set.
It's enough to take out the entire mausoleum itself.
We just need to retile it now.
The time has finally come...
"Tonight, we will be freed from her spell!"
Her rule has been disastorous for the empire
Her desire for peace has held us back

Have they been treating you well?
I know I owe you righteousness
I can only repay in my next life
But you owe them justice!
You have to repay it today!

The nucleus?
"Well, don't say it like a question, son."

The nucleus.
That's right -- the nucleus.

"- You better get used to it, Will."
Especially when not even your wife will defend herself.
"Give me something, Laine."
Anything.
"Hell, just deny it."
Why don't you just deny it?
It is simply beneath my dignity.
Dignity!
Right.

"It's already done, you know."
"Fortunately, our clandestine escape coincided with another story."
"Sorry, Nicolas, but we're in a crisis of identity."
Crisis?
- We do not agree with anything.
Anything.
Anything.
"The old generation wants tradition, we merge."
"In Istanbul, we had to appear on television"
For the first time after so many years.
Stupid storm.
But Mr. Lloyd will make a music video.
"Yes, I hope so."
The first shot was just to have fun.
Maybe they just had to clear their minds.
The real canton for the video is a cosmic classic.
"Then, Mr. Lloyd, his flight plan ends so?"
Miss?
- Ana.
"Ana, yes."
Can you give us some information on transport?
Yes.
If only there were.
You'll notice the substance encrusting that rock.
Yes.
"Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
- So?
"- Perhaps nothing, doctor."
Perhaps everything.
Earthling!
Captain!
Who is this?
The Metron?
"This is your opponent, earthling."
I have heard every word you have said.
- All right.
What do you want?
- I weary of the chase.
Wait for me.
I shall be merciful and quick.
- Like you were at Cestus III?
- You were intruding!
You established an outpost in our space.
You butchered helpless human beings.
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you.
Can that be true?
Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space?
"It may well be possible, doctor."
We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
Then we could be in the wrong.
Perhaps.
That is something best decided by diplomats.
The Gorns simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
Yes.
No I'll show you
Dare say I'm impotent?
Help
What happened to you?
I...
I've lost
Who are you?
Are you two having an affair?
"I'm calling the police, you are illegal immigrants I'll report you"
I'll sue you for breaking in
He's calling the police
"Never mind him, he's crazy..."
You say I'm crazy?
I'll beat you...
You want me to buy everything
Cassette player
Buy the whole of Hong Kong if you can
You want to buy everything
Television
"You say I'm no use, but I've bought everything"
No use
"It hurts, I can't walk"
She's bleeding badly
You better call an ambulance
None of your business
"Madam, you call an ambulance for me please"
Alright...
I'll call for you
They'll deport you back to China
Ordo Draconis - (K) Kopyleft 2016.
All Rites Reversed...
¡Owen‎!
Owen‎!
Come here‎.
I'm all ears‎.
Another time‎.
Let's load these trucks and move‎.
Agreed‎.
Welcome gentlemen to express Owens‎.
Watch your head‎.
"Our next stop‎, hot baths‎, beds and good food‎."
‎
- Good Morning‎. ‎
- Where did you get that‎?
Lo Tome por AHI‎.
I had to make something for my brother and thus prove I was here‎.
You know I'll never let you take it home‎.
Never say Never‎.
Did you find more treasure‎?
Behind the graves‎.
They excarvaron and left all these things before you leave here‎.
Speaking of treasures ‎.‎.‎.
"I have some novels you love‎, but want your cigarillos‎."
Here they are‎.
Are you serious‎?
Is that a fair exchange‎?
"No smoke‎, but read‎."
What is the problem‎?
Have you heard of the robbery on the highway‎?
All that crap you have a package worth just there‎.
These are hard to find‎.
All right‎.
What will I do with cigarettes‎?
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
I use it for exercises
Clementine...
I've come to a decision
I'm leaving with you.
It's all decided
If you agree
"I'll write my mother when we're there, explaining my decision"
When we arrive... where?
Wherever you're going
I packed a suitcase.
I'll be ready.
You'll see
I'll manage all the details
I'm sure you will
"Please, don't joke."
I can't stand it
I'll never cause you any problem
I'm the one who would cause you problems
I'm sick... finished
"Yes, I mean it."
I'm flat broke
Poverty doesn't scare me
You know what it is?
An empty stable is poverty to you or a dress you wear for two seasons.
The real thing you don't know
"Here, look"
Quite a group
Is that you there?
It's you
It was.
"Where he went, women used to adore him"
But he died penniless
"I may not always be truthful with anna,"
But I am always honest.
"Difficult balance, that."
One that I imagine you know all too well.
Here we are.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far
With a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
"Well, she looks to have seen better days."
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.
Do you have another one of those?
Someone's getting very confident.
Hmm.
Bingo.
Careful.
Some can be skittish.
Very well aware of that.
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
The constrictor causes
Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction.
"Bones break, I'm afraid."
It was originally designed for back massage.
Hmm.
Right.
Let's call it in.
"Miss carter, I'm not sure you've thought this through."
I can't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find.
I'm not suggesting...
The enemy is cloaked and is fast!
"It seems to be using arrows, which is probably to..."
"Right, muzzle flashes would make it easy to pinpoint its location."
This must be to avoid that.
Optical camouflage?
Does invisibility technology even...?
It must be based on...
"Anyway, it's ingenious."
"There's nothing on my thermograph, and it's not casting a shadow."
But...
It definitely exists.
Yeah.
"You are giving this to me, Milord?"
Customize it however you like.
I've already discussed the matters of your peerage title and activation factor with Princess Lemrina.
Milord Slaine...
The arrow has been loosed.
There is no turning back now.
"Yes, Milord!"
Count Sebring.
Count Raffia.
Inform Count Orga.
Tell him to swear fealty.
"Smoke grenades, loading complete."
"Ready here, too."
Fire!
"He's right, it definitely exists."
And if it exists... it will have an effect on air currents!
Target located.
Right!
Open fire!
- Lieutenant!
You don't have to be on such a death-defying mission.
Not anymore...
What?
I don't want to see it happen anymore.
Don't want to see it anymore?
That's right...
Like your older brother.
"Don't look so worried, Kuya."
But...
Your brother is about to venture out into unknown technological territory.
I can understand your concern.
But a tremendous amount of money and the best brains in the world are behind this experiment.
That's right.
"Don't worry, Kuya."
"Elbow No. 1, EM level, clear."
"No. 2 and 3, clear."
No. 4 clear.
"Gravitator, active."
Unlock quadro-main capillary.
Insert reactor.
Confirm reactor load.
Result code normal.
Confirm all circuit connection.
"Dangaioh, ready to start."
Let's start the operation experiment.
Start operation experiment.
Move to start position.
Release anchor.
Release elbow lock.
There's abnormal pressure in the main converter!
Can you bypass it?
I'm trying.
And here we go.
We loosen our arms And up and down and up and...
Sir.
Excuse me.
"Import, export."
Let's go.
Mr. Vanyerka?
-Doctor Yansky?
-Yes.
What would you like?
You're not going to invite us in?
Of course.
Please.
You were chosen by the biggest computer in the galaxy to be the representative of the planet.
Congratulations.
We came to accumulate objective systematical information.
About the conditions on Earth.
This is a confidential mission.
You understand?
"Calm down, please."
Part of our project is to be inconspicuous.
"But if you really arrived from outer space, you would look completely different."
Like what?
For example like green elves or something like that.
We don't like doing this.
Every change of appearance exhausts us.
Doesn't it?
Then we must rest for a long time.
Now do you believe us?
"Excuse me, but why me?"
Why only me?
How can I be beneficial to you?
It warns you're a dangerous man
I stole a loaf of bread
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law
I know the meaning of those 19 years
A slave of the law!
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
"Yes, 24601"
My name is Jean Valjean!
And I'm Javert!
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me 24601
CONVICTS:
"Look down, look down"
You'll always be a slave
"Look down, look down"
You're standing in your grave
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(PANTING)
(SINGING) Freedom at last How strange the taste
"Never forget the years, the waste"
Nor forgive them for what they've done
They are the guilty Everyone
The day begins And now let's see
What this new world Will do for me
Can I help?
A day's work?
OVERSEER:
Papers.
"You know, between us he spent his time annoy others."
Look at the comments of his former comrades.
Everyone is happy.
His death brings them satisfaction.
"""Master Sakotaaaa"""
"""Finally dead."""
"""He not deserve to live."""
Yesterday one person died .
Yet there is more people satisfied
"The head of murdering a taxi driver this morning and the theft of her recipe before taking flight from the video of the taxi, it would be the former inmate"
"Otoharada Kuro, 46 ."
The address he gave to his release is false.
It took a notice research to find him.
Done.
He resurfaced Otoharada.
Now I count on you to find him.
Then...
Yagami.
Do not disappoint me.
Yes.
- Return to your quarters!
- Yes.
"Chief, this time..."
"Refer to the jurisdiction, and will investigate."
We must give them every detail.
Yes.
Course.
This Ogiso a big head.
"Yeah, but wait."
The head endures same.
The leader knows the suspect Otoharada?
You not know?
Please keep that in mind
Yes... sorry
Don't sit there
I forbid you from being in my sight
"Excuse me, but..."
Why did you choose such a nice room?
Are you asking me?
Yes
Um...
Were you showing off or something?
That wasn't my intent
Satsuki said she liked this room
"Yep, I like it"
"Sorry, it's just me showing off"
It's not Satsuki's fault
"Mr. Aida, you're so nice"
You think so?
Bebi!
Do you grasp the situation you are in?
I wanted to be your friend but this is horrible
Sorry...
You betrayed us
You said you would come right out
Sorry
Appologizing doesn't solve anything
She is my close friend
"You understood the situation, right?"
"Lin, stop it"
Yelling at Bebi doesn't solve anything
Unless it's going to lead you guys to bed
Lin topping and Mr. Aida bottoming
That's so kinky
-Not noodles.
Why me?
Why only me?
Why only me?
Why only...
What is it?
-A soft-boiled egg.
-It has a great shape.
"A civilization that can produce such a perfect thing,"
- is a very advanced civilization.
"-This is not produced,"
-hens lay these.
-Hens?
-Yes.
Tell them we congratulate them.
"Excuse me, but according to the program we have an opinion poll."
Do you want help?
You're not going to eat?
"No, don't worry."
We have our own methods.
Good afternoon.
How would you react to a visit from extraterrestrial civilizations?
I would kick them in the arse!
"Look, I'm not intrerested in politics."
"At work I'm doing my job, I adorn windows."
I want my own peace.
Good afternoon.How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Pidlivization?
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial pidlivization?
Civilization.
It depends on where they came from.
Good afternoon.
"No, Mr. Scott."
Neither you nor I can be spared here.
"Mr. DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear."
"Mr.Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there."
Dr. McCoy will accompany.
"If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question."
Dismissed.
"[ Uhura ] No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked onto their original source."
Very good.
Transmit coordinates to Mr. Scott.
"Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately."
Use the laser beacon if necessary.
"Ready, Scott?"
"Ready, Mr. Spock."
Activate.
"Where are your storms,Jaeger?"
Atmosphere... exactly the same as ours.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
DeSalle to Enterprise.
DeSalle to Enterprise.
It doesn't function.
We're cut off.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
No response.
Keep trying with yours.
[ Beacon Whistles ]
Something's blocking the beacon.
Got to find open ground.
Jaeger!
McCoy!
"In the name of heaven, where are we?"
Look.
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.
"""No voice divine the storm allayed."
"No light propitious shone."""
"'When snatched from all effectual aid, we perished, each alone."""
Mamma...
Look.
This has just arrived.
"""I should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon..."""
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No.
I will fetch her.
"Wait, let us delay."
I believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.
It would be cruel to take her away so soon.
Devonshire is so far.
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable?
But...?
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate.
His reading...
Elinor has not your feelings.
Can he love her?
Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet.

You're using that as an excuse for violence?
That is horrible
That is a crime
You don't know anything do you?
What?
She was a prostitute
For over six months
It's total bullshit
Fucking bullshit
I told her to quit many times
She totally ignored me
She even said she quit
But just changed shops
It's worse than just being unfaithful
"She had no right to bitch, even when I hit her"
Thanks to her I may have HIV
Now that shit is a crime
What the fuck man?
It's getting to my head
That's a lie
It's not a fucking lie
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown
What if I have it?
My life would be ruined
That's a lie
It's not a fucking lie
She got me infected

A different STD.
Clamydia
Clamydia heightens the chance of HIV
Anything I desire eh?
We'll come later
We just wanted to stop by
Good bye
What's he doing here?
"I'll find out right away, your Majesty"
"Whatever he is here for, I don't want to see him here again"
Aye aye
Why are you here?
Paşa your Lordship
I came here to see princess
When wil she be released?
Whenever his Majesty wants
Maybe ever
But my Paşa...
It is very serious.
There would be a big conflict
Let it happen
Then we would see how serious it is
Additionally
Don't come here ever again

It's pressurising.
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
After you.

Bio-signs... very faint.
REED:
Coming from in here.
[Solemn instrumental music]
Some kind of shuttlecraft?
ARCHER:
More like an assault vehicle.
"I'm reading a half-dozen particle-cannons, torpedo launchers."
[Radio beeps]
Archer.
"TRIP: [On radio] You'd better get over here, sir."
T'POL:
The DNA is identical to the bodies we found.
They would appear to be the crew's offspring.
A hatchery?
They built this place to take quite a beating.
"Reinforced bulkheads, backup power systems."
Thirty-one eggs are still viable.
They won't survive for long.
Their bio-support is losing power.
Do you think you can repair it?
I wouldn't even know where to start.
"There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay, get it back to the ship."
I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
"Aye, sir."
ARCHER:
"It's my ship, Mr. Spock."
I should be there.
- We can't even get at them.
"- Nor can they at us, at the moment."
Not unless they move their original position.
That intervening high ground.
You remember the layout of this place?
The arsenal?
About 100 yards in that direction.
But after an attack as thorough as this one...
I'll risk it.
Kirk here.
Report.
"Captain, are you all right?"
Never mind about me.
What about the ship?
We returned fire with all phaser banks.
Negative against its deflector screen.
- Arm your photon torpedoes.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Arm photon torpedoes.
Stand by.
Any identification on the attacking vessel?
"No, sir."
Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're familiar with.
We can't get visual contact.
She's too far away.
"Mr. Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on."
"Photon torpedoes locked on, captain."
Fire all banks.
"All banks fired, sir."
Sulu.
You look lovely when you're angry.
Stop it!
I'll love you... if you want.
"Oh, yeah?"
But don't boss me around.
I don't want to boss you around.
"Then love me for a change, and stop annoying me."
Then love me for a change.
Sometimes you're so...
"Oh, no!"
Why did you go to that movie?
"Well, I think we're even now."
Bye.
I've finished work.
Nervous... arrogant... vain... unkempt... unhealthy... self-satisfied... full of longing... spent...

"- No, arrogant annoys me."

- Yeah.
It's your turn.
Reserved... frustrated... inhibited... hesitant... closed-up... pulled together... egocentric... not hungry.
You don't want anything to eat?
- Why egocentric?

- Because you are.
- You're not egocentric?
- I don't know.

The place is clean:
Did you check the reactors for any unusual devices?
"Yes, sir:"
Swept them with the magnetometer:
Everything's normal:
Looks like your hunch was wrong:
"Yeah, yeah:"
"Well, thank you, Parsons:"
You better stay here and keep an eye on things:
"Yes, sir:"
Let's go:
Where to now?
I don't know:
Looks like we struck a dead end:
Colonel Deering:
Captain Rogers:!
I just searched the supply room:
It was Reardon:
He changed himself to look like Parsons:
It's locked:
Stand back:
"Reardon, we know you're in here:"
You might as well show yourself and surrender:
"Hawk, you see anything?"
"Nothing, Buck:"
It appears as though Reardon has left the reactor room:
- But how?
- Perhaps through another door:
"What do you mean, another door?"
You know as well as I do there's only one way out of this reactor room:
Buck?
Where's that detonator?
Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
If I knew now
What I knew then
I'd run from these blues-soaked hills
And I'd go back to the well
And chew her white lipstick
"And her long, slow kisses"
If I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
One more time
While the gray wall crumbles
I'll tell the keeper
Bring us something else to smoke
While we're naked and alone
So they make us immortal
So they make us a deal
Will it matter when we're naked and alone?
Such a beauty with a smile
There'll be opportunity
And abundance for all
But if I let you inside me
Will you stay for long?
The one and only
While the gray wall crumbles
Whatever you are
Whatever you want
I can see it in your eyes
No more had oaths
Only a ray of light on the wall
When I wake up from our sleep
To a bright new sunny day
I no longer miss the shadow
I want to touch the air
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love
Where the antennae Reach for the stars
You'll be free to fly
The flame won't die
It'll just bum in my chest
Your hand in mine
"I look at you, touch you"
I feel the yearning too
And secretly
I'm in love

AND IF MARY MARGARET SHOULD TAKE THE BLAME...
SHE'D BE RUlNED.
AND YOU'D HAVE YOUR VlCTORY.
I'M SORRY.
"I AM SO, SO SORRY."
DAVlD AND KATHRYN DEClDED TO END THElR MARRlAGE.
"BUT WHEN KATHRYN'S CAR WAS FOUND ON THE SlDE OF THE ROAD,"
EMMA LAUNCHED AN INVESTlGATlON.
IT'S REGlSTERED TO KATHRYN NOLAN.
"AND WlTH RUBY'S HELP, THEY MADE A SHOCKlNG DlSCOVERY."
AAH!
A HUMAN HEART
THAT MATCHED KATHRYN'S D.N.A.
IS THAT WHAT I THlNK IT IS?
ALL OF THE CLUES POlNTED TO ONE SUSPECT.
THERE WERE FlNGERPRlNTS INSlDE THE LlD OF THE BOX.

"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.

-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?

"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"

You're going to teach him?
Do you think that makes sense?
He's an elementary school student.
So rash.
Dummy how can you?
I can at least teach him the multiplication table.
I finished the multiplication table in 2nd grade though.
Really?
It's going to be more harmful than anything.
Let's just eat the cake.

You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.

There was one last night too.
"It's So it, so it just ended?"
It just happened right now?
Yeah.
"Just now. ,, , What part of California do you live in?"
Los Angeles What?
"Oh, okay."
"Oh yeah, I see where it came from."
I'm just looking at the epicenter.
Yup.
"Or we can do it online, god, geez."
"Yeah, we're coming to"
"California in a, a few weeks here."
"We're in the middle of a heat wave right now and we had an earthquake last night and, and earthquake today."
And I'm just hoping that this earthquake is not a harbinger of a big one.
"Oh, oh."
I hope not.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Oh, the, the, yeah."
Cuz that's.
A big earthquake.

I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.

An Advaita Song
Satsang with Mooji
[Mooji:]
Hari Om.
[Questioner:]
When I came to Lucknow in '96
[M:]
They want you to put the microphone more close.
[Q:]
Yes.
"When I came to Lucknow in '96, it was a little... scary for me."
and I had the great grace to meet Papaji at that time and you remind me very much of him.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
He's here you know?
[Q:]
"Yes, I do."
And so at that time I wasn't quite ready to sing for him.
So I wondered if maybe I could  sing for you just a little bit.
[M:]
Oh yes.
[Q:]
A song that was in my heart  but never made it to my mouth.
[Mooji laughs]
[M:]
"Oh yes, please."
[Q:]
It seemed childish and simplistic.
"It was embarassing, and I felt I just wasn't ready at that time."
"So, we go."
"Row, row, row, your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,"
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."

"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
"Yes, what does it mean?"
How much is this?
Correct.
"Hey guys, let's eat a snack."
What is this?
"Hey, what's the use in knowing that?"
The No Ri that we love
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"
"Eun Jo, congratulations on being discharged."
Thank you.
"Seung Jo hyung and Ha Ni noona, thank you for teaching me."
Okay.
"If there's something you don't know, always call me."
"You know my phone number, right?"
"Yes, I will."
"No Ri, get healed quickly."
"Yes, this kind of disease won't be a problem."
"No Ri,"
"All Rio has to do is get his victim safely to shore, grab the flag, and he wins."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" Make sure not to let my head go under in case he went under."
I wanted to see where he was at all times.
Stay calm.
I'm here to rescue you.
You're going to be okay.
I got you.
"Just try to kick with me, all right?"
I'm swimming for the finish line.
That's when I see Paul.
Paul:
"I get to the bridge, I look out in the lake,"
I see two swamped canoes and some guy in the middle of the lake splashing around.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" We're almost there, okay?"
Paul:
Calm!
Stay calm!
Everything's coming back to me from my Life Saving merit badge.
Get the person calm in the water before you approach him.
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I got him to the shore."
I pulled him out of the water.
You okay?
"All right, you'll be all right, man."
Teenager:
"Hey, man, you get the flag."
Teenager #14:
Outstanding...
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #14: ...brother!
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
"No, I can't take that from you."
"Yes, you can!"
You can take this money from me.
"For God's sake, is not much."
"Now, take it!"
And don't you dare leave it here.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Is just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that is two years next month since he was taken?
"I think to myself at times... ...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd..."
"Oh, I don't know what I'd do."
Now... ...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey.
You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be.
Is nice.
I get to see you every day now.
"I liked seeing you tonight, Peter."
"Oh, boy, yeah."
"""Oh, boy, yeah"" what?"
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was... ...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
Judging from that Yello Robe fellow's expressions... he must have wicked plans for Wanqing &amp;amp; Master Tuan.
No
I must try to inform the Tuan family first.
"Go, little snake."
Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."
So you know our guys are looking forward to it.
It's an opportunity to play at home.
And to home course call it advantage if you want to but were looking forward to playing them at home.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Anything else you like to add?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Just that you know there's no admission to come and watch the golf team play.

You hear me?
Where's my mommy?
"She's gone, but..."
I can't do it.
I can't fucking do it!
Your mommy... told me she'd be back soon.
She said you have to be good... and wait for her here.
Okay?
- You're a liar.
She's not coming back.
- I promise she is.
I'm scared.
Don't leave me here alone.
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Stop, please!"
Where are you?
I don't want to see her die again!
"Please, I beg you."
Help me.

This is yours.
"January 11, 1974."
There's a problem with your brother's certificate... we couldn't find it.
"You said he was born in June 1980, but it's not here."
What do you mean it's not here?
"He may not have been born here, or it could be a mistake."
"However, we just moved here and everything still has to be saved on the computer so..."
Pablo?
God.
We found your brother's car this morning in the woods 20 miles away from Tolhuin.
It'd been there all night.
"Why can't you harness that strength to eat?"""
"""But why?"
"Why do I need to eat?"""
Captain Carpenter.
"I would like to talk to Lieutenant Gerard, please."
Lieutenant Gerard isn't here.
Be glad to take a message.
I'd like to talk to him.
"It's about this fellow, uh, Kimble."
Kimble?
You have something on Kimble?
I sure have.
I'd like to say it to the lieutenant.
I'm afraid you'll have to say it to me.
Lieutenant Gerard's out of town.
SOPHlE:
"I never liked him, right from the beginning."
"So when I saw this picture, I called the cops."
"You think he killed your friend, Priamos?"
Sure he killed him.
"Gus found out who he was, so he killed him."
"He's been spotted before, and he didn't kill."
"What do you mean, ""didn't kill""?"
"He killed his wife, didn't he?"
The law says he did.
Okay.
"So if Gus ain't dead, where is he?"
He hasn't been seen all day.
"The car's gone, and the money's gone."
Where's the money?
What money?
"Gus had 8,000 bucks."
- May God give you more.
Afiyet olsun.
"Mehmet, where's our tea?"
"Just kidding, sit down."
Eat your food.

Eat from that çörek as well.
It's the çörek my dad sells the most.

- Whoa!
"Mmm, this one is delicious as well."
This doesn't look like bakery material tho.
Where is this from?
From a certain çirkin.

That's how I saw her.

"I am Münir Erkut, lawyer."
I told Barış all I had to say.
I don't want anything from him.
I have no demands.
All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not an attorney to the person you mentioned.
I am Kazım Gencerel's lawyer.
My condolences.
I had not told my daughter about it.
My condolences.
Your father wanted me to give you something.
Please come inside.

"- No, Hüseyin Bey."
Thank you very much.
Come.
"No one from the mansion comes here, right?"
"Don't worry, no one can disturb us here."
You are stone.
"I have never asked you for anything, O Lord."
Today I ask for my son's life.
Please grant my son his life!
Please let my son live.
Take my life instead.
"Renu, I have good news for you."
Hello!
Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.
Hospital!
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.
A bullet hit his shoulder and now it's out.
He'll be dancing within a week.
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj.
God heard my prayers.
This means that our hero is perfectly all right.
He is no ordinary hero.
His plane caught fire and it crashed.
He landed with his parachute right in the midst of the enemy.
He was 20 miles away from our side... ... and he came back avoiding the shower of bullets.
Can we meet Suraj?
The visiting hours are from 4 to 6.
You can meet him then.
Goodbye!
"Come, aunty."
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.
"Hello, aunty!"
Are you all right?
- Perfect!
"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
Rajesh!
- Now you can keep your gal with you!
"Rajesh, seema is not what you think of her!"
But how come that flower string was with you?
Forget that flower string!
"Believe me, Rajesh! seema is sacred like the Ganges!"
"Marry her, Rajesh!"
Marry her! only you can keep her happy!
And look..
I have fixed your alliance!
"lf you didn""t marry her, then her family""s image will be tarnished!"
"Look, Rajesh!"
I beg you!
I plead with you!
You have done so many favours on me!
Do one more favour on me!
"Marry seema, Rajesh!"
Marry seema!
Are you drinking poison? - seema!
Look here!
"Look here, sister-in-law!"
"Look who is the groom! shekhar! seema, I had told you that love is very strong!"
It can face any big storm! so what?
"I don""t accept this wedding!"
"This is not a wedding! lts betrayal! lt""s cheating!"
"I didn""t expect this joke from you!"
"This is not a joke! lts true, Mrs. Dinanath!"
Actually I was going to marry her.
"But when I found out about shekhar and seema""s love.. ..l fulfilled my duty!"
This is not duty!
This is betrayal!
I will report to lG sir!
And Number 9 is going ahead.
A tough competition between number 9 and number 16.
Well done Jimmy!
"Number 9... - Idiot, he has got number 16... yes."
To hell with this number 9.
He's cheating. hey're about to reach Panvel point now.
Number 9 is still ahead.
Jaikishan has also reached there now.
He's in full speed.
It seems Jikishan has vowed to make Rajdoot win.
But number 16 is also very adamant it seems.
There they come to the final.
They're about to reach.
And here they've come. and they're on the point.
Number 9... number 16...

"""You are my dream-boy."
"You are my love."""
"""You are my Hero..."""
This is a cheating.
It's partiality.
And father they dig 3 feet deep pits in my ways.
And they made total confusion on finishing line.
"You must have seen, father."
"Don't get disheartened, my child."
I've told Pundit to fix a date for your marriage with Radha.
Father!
You are God!
You are a great man.
And I'm a thief!
Otherwise I have no hope.

I'm asking it for...
Q: the full explaination.
We're encouraging everyone to chant Hare Krishna mantra
"Q: yet we're seeing now there's one quote in Padma-purana, the sa that same, without proper initiation, the mantra received is wihout effect."
So is it that those without proper connection they're not getting any benefit from chanting the mantra?
[What did he say?]
Q2:
[bengali] [onosoly??] progress is near impossible.
Proper progress.
"There maybe something like [unna??], [backward??] marriage?"
"Like [budwa??] activating and sadure, abruptly it may become or may not namabhas."
I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!
- Give back the crayons!
Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!
Here!
Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."

"Don't be angry, Valerian I'll bring you some chocolate tomorrow"
And me?
And you?
You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"
"Haha, It's not really a magic tablet I was just joking!"

"They asked students to turn off their cell phones in libraries, classes, hospitals and concerts and..."
Mom
- Mom!
- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
I danced on stage with all my might.
"So my bones are thick, not thin."
Scanning Zelo's leg's to the end.
Shall we get started!
Shall we get started!
Who is this?
Shall we get started on filming?
It's my turn to lip sync for the MV.
I'm looking forward to it.
Since the background is so pretty.
Anybody with that background will come out very well for sure.
- Great job.
- Great job.
Great work.
MV lip sync is over.
Great work.
None
We have to shoot again.
My face is probably bloated right now.
I slept a lot.
It was past three thirty when I checked in the car earlier.
I feel tired but it was a good all-nighter.
"- oh, Jong Up is here too."
- Hi.
He's my manager for the day.
- Bring me some water.
- Water?
Then I gotta dig up soil...
"Then hurry and dig, here."
- It's cement so you'll be done in no time.
"- I don't think I can, I'm too sleepy."
This is an elevator in Las Vegas.
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
"- Kerim, are you at work?"
"No, abi..."
I've quit the job.
What's up?
"Oh, why?"
"Anyways, maybe this is the best for us."
- Listen to me now...
"- What's wrong, abi?"
Come home now...
Or don't...
As there are still many reporters here.
It's better you park your car in the auto-park near the shore.
Then walk over here and call me when you're two streets away from us.
But don't let anyone see you.
- I don't get what this is about.
- I'll take you away from here for a few days.
It was five of six years ago.
Your dad made me buy this house.
This land is valuable.
You can do anything you want here.
"You can change it completely, if you want."
Why would I change it.
What is it to me.
"This land and this house is yours, Kerim."
"No, abi."
We're just guests here.
"Besides, I don't want a house or anything."
"We'll just spend a few days here, that's all."
- Thank you.
- Anyway... ...
It's too early to talk about all this.
There it is.
Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
Or D.W.I..
Anything but this.
"I could like, have this baby and give it to someone who totally needs it."
You should look in the Penny Saver.
They have ads for parents?
Oh yeah!

No?
"When this is all over, we can always get back together."
Oh...were we together?
Yeah!
We were once.
"You know, that time."
You think you really wanna do this?
"If I could just have the thing and give it to you know, I totally would."
"But guessing it looks probably like a seamonkey right now, we should let it get a little cuter."
Right?

"- 32, sir! strange!"
How did you get stuck at 32?
"Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."

Alright
Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
He has forgotten all of us.
Hatun Abla...
Look...Maybe this baby will be born but...
Mustafa won't even recognize it.
"What kind of husband or man... ...or father he will be, that I don't know, but..."
"If you and the doctor ask and if Narin helps and goes to the hospital to see him,  maybe he will get better."
Stay away from Narin!
Enough of your malice!
Enough!
"Hatun Abla, for every cruelty I did to you... for my every misbehaviour, forgive me!"
Please...
"Look, I will cary you on my back until I die."
I will clean you...
I will be your slave.
"Please, forgive me Hatun Abla."
"Doctor, please help..."
"Look, If you want, I can give you golds I kept at my mom's house."
"Fatma, take me..."
"Hatun Abla, please!"
"Hatun Abla, please forgive me."
Pull yourself together...
Get up...
Please...
Inci Teyze...
Get up my girl...
"Hatun Abla, please..."
Asiye...Pull yourself together...
Maybe you should give her some medicine???
"Not now, mom..."
Let me take you home.
They will be worried.
Who will worry about me?
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."
Can you stop for a minute?
I am trying to explain you something.
Can you wait for a minute?-it's OK.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
You always are like this.
Go!
~ ChatGiray:
"I miss you, are we going to meet tomorrow?"
Ayse:

Come in the afternoon break if you want. ~ Kenan calling.
"Yes..&amp;gt; Ayse, hello.."
Kenan?!
Where are you?
Are you out?
"Not at all girl, don't be happy right away."
Where are you calling from?
"Cut it off, I can't talk for long."
"Ayse, I need Yaman's phone number, could you find it?"
"Just a minute I have it registered on my phone, I have to search it."
Are you OK?
Did you get my letter?
Did you write a letter?
"No, I didn't get anything."
"Come on, I really don't have time."
"We will talk with you later, give me that phone number."
"Okay , I'm spelling it."
"Ah man, Mert!"
I brought you lucky chestnuts instead of lucky rice.(kind of believe that -special rice blessed with prayers brings luck
It's our nation.
"You crack jokes about me, maybe not in public but I'm sure you do when you go home."
[Laughter]
Okay so thank you.
"Do you mind if we don't ask your question Derrick, because we've gone over time."
"So maybe can we.. sorry, no announcements, so the announcement is - there is no announcements tonight!"
[Laughter].
"So if you've got any other questions or you'd like to discuss that matter with me afterwards sir, please come up after the talk is finished."

"My friends say.. that by saying no, men become women""s slave."
ls that so? so you want to make me your slave?
- Yes.
What else did they say?
"My friends also say.. when men become fervent.. ..then they should meet the girl""s father and not the girl."
I think your friends have fallen in love with me.
And by teaching you wrong things they want to get rid of you.
And they want to form a relationship with me. seema.. how is your friend?
ls she very beautiful?
ls she young?
- Yes!
ls she capricious?
- Why?
"What""s your problem?"
I have no problem!
Filthy man!
You think about other girls!
"Yes, now I will have to think!"
Why?
"What""s the flaw in me?"
"Not flaw, injustice!"
"I want to come closer to you and you are going away! seema.. you won""t go away from me, will you?"
- No.
Your love has made my plight bad!
"Yes, seema."
"You belong to me, don""t you?"
- Yes. only you dwell in my heart.
Believe me.
"Beloved, this is true."
"Let""s love in the open. only you dwell in my heart."
Do you see this star?
I want you to draw this star down here.
Take your time.
You worked so hard on that!
I want you to pick up a penny in one hand and then you're going to put it in these fingers.
Drop it in here.
OK can you do three of them?
You do one at a time.
Take one from that hand and put it in that one.
Great job!
Let's put them back.
This time I'm going to count while you do it and then time you.
So you're going to go as fast as you can when I say go.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Let's do it one more time.
Ready?
Go.
OK.
Start with one hand and one foot in front of us and the other hand and other foot are going to be behind us.
I'm going to jump and switch them.
Jump and switch them.
Can you try it?
Alright.
You have to switch your hands and your feet at the same time.
OK are you ready?
When I say go I want you to go until I say stop.
Ready?
Go.
Good.
Stop.
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
Is it okay living here?
"Since it is a guest room, it is kind of small."
But it's tolerable.
I'm only staying here for a little bit anyways.
We're staying here until the new house is built.
Will it be okay?
What?
I'm talking about Hae Ra.
She was the one you were meeting today. . .
How could you have parted that way.
"Well, since she was with Kyung Su Sunbae."
"Excuse me, Hae Ra."
I have something to tell you.
"It's really hard for me to say, so I hope you will listen."
I know.
I am not good enough.
Pardon?
Not good enough?
Then have mine too.
I didn't mean...
Foo... food is enough.
I'll continue.
"I have tried my best not to think about it,"
But I keep thinking of you. . .
Should I just leave?
I have a headache.
"You have a headache? then, you should take some medicine for it."
"Take your time, I will pay and leave now."
Hae Ra.
I know that I lack a lot of things.
That's why
I decided to try hard and not think of you
Yes!
"You're happy I got tickets for the game, huh?"
Yeah yeah
Huh?
"You're happy, huh?"
"Yeah yeah, it's great"
"That's a nice gift, isn't it?"
Yes!
"It really pleased you, huh"
"It wasn't easy to get tickets, huh"
"Well, it was easy for me, one my friends works in an office and was able to give me tickets"
"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"
"A nice game, no, really, I like it"
"I feel good seeing him happy, it pleases me, it's..."
Really...
Thank you!!!
"Oh, you're not gonna put make-up on, again?"
"Look, Loulou, my lipstick is all gone"
What?
Miss Universe!
Miss Universe...
"Careful, there, oh!"
"Stop it, Loulou, you're being silly"
"Oh, come on!"
"But, look, you're an idiot!"
Careful!
"Stop it, Loulou, it's really not funny!"
"I know it's not funny, can't do anyhting about it, it's the car that does that all the time"
"Stop it, I'm telling you!"
"Oh, come on, breathe!"
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
"Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order."
"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.
I'm asking you to leave.
Please.
You got the newspapers?
What does it write about us?
"Look, I'm asking you, please, don't open your mouth no matter what they ask you."
"Okay, Kadir Bey."
Don't you worry.
- And Kerim has just went out.
"- Yeah, I saw."
"- ""They admitted they money""  - Fatmagül better not see this."
Good morning.
"- Fatmagül, don't read it."
- I agree.
This is sweet.
This will reduce all  the cheering to nil.
- You see how the tide has turned.
- That's right.
Just you wait...
Let's go to the hospital and visit my yenge then.
That's what we're doing right now.
- You're gonna talk to her today?
- Nope.
I won't... until she comes and apologizes to me.
You're the man!
- What are you doing here?
- Can we ask you a few questions?
"- No, you can't."
- Just a few.
"Look, we said it all at court."
You are helping them by doing this.
"But you took the money and  set up a business with it, didn't you?"
"No, no."
"Jackie is injured, sir."
He can't go much far.
He must be somewhere nearby.
D'souza!
Wherever he's...
I can't return home until I find him.
You... sir?!
"- Yes, I..."
Now I'll bring Jackie dead.

Say I can't stand being with a guy like him anymore.
But... you want me to say that?
Just help me this once.
I can't say it to him myself.
Mi-ryung asked me to tell you this.
She wants to break up with you.
She can't stand... being with a guy like you any longer.
He's crying.
You can hang up now.
She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.
"Yes, really."
Wait.
Now what?
You said it's finished!
Thank you so much.
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?
Don't bother.
We're over
Separation Agency
"For people who are hesitant about breaking up, or for those who have trouble saying the words,"
"I will... no, we will do it for you."
Separation Agency.
I wish it would just pour rain and cool things off.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Didn't she come in here just now?
Oh my god!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Damn, why's it so dark?"
Is it on backwards again
Why did you drink so much?
Come to your senses!
Good job.
Go on your way.
Aren't you going to give me some...?
- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
"Hey, my son"
"Here you are, sir!"
We are looking for of Bulent Tiryakia!Where do we find him

Dalyan...
Stab me!
My soul is burning when firing the trigger...
That look of yours... saying 'Don't forget me!'...
It marked my betrayal on my forehead.

"C'mon, shoot!...Shoot..."
Shoot!
"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."

"And i can't live in fear, Lan."

Why are you doing this?
I'm talking to youI failed...
Why are you doing this?
I'm telling you I'm not betraying you!
I will never do it!
"That's right, I'm crazy."
You must have suffered living with a crazy woman!
Do you think I have nowhere to go?
There are men everywhere.
"Hang up, moron."
"Dammit, it's a mountain."
Man...
I'm at the top.
I guess I have to go down.
Bring me some money.
Why?
I got caught at a motel having an affair.
"By My husband, of course..."
He brought the cops.
The moron got those errands people to follow me.
"They took my bag, too."
I don't even have a damn coin.
Who?
College what?
So what if he's young.
So you're bringing some money or not?
"Listen, bitch, if you weren't gonna come, what's with the twenty questions?"
"Bitch, you said you were jealous of me having an affair, too."
Bitch...
Being a friend means to help out in times of need.
Bye!
Hey could you lend me about 50 dollars?
Me?
"If you have some money, Lend me about 50 bucks."
30!
That's all I've got.
I'll pay you back
- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
HENRY.

The first thing I wanna do is I wanna hear this class the greatest class to ever graduate the University of Rochester the class of 2012.
Let's hit it!
This is your day to take stock and congratulate yourselves.
"You have successfully completed one of the major steps in life's long journey, and you've done it at one of the outstanding educational institutions in the world."
"Over 50 years ago, I sat before you, the class of 1958."
"Since I've put my 50 years in, it's time for a little bit advice."
Exercise your passion.
Seek out what turns you on.
Find something where you really enjoy what you do every morning.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
Some illness it's hard to put your finger on.
It's now every night!
"I know he's not working, I know he's not"
She thinks I'm driving you away.
She's a child!
How do you kill someone with voodoo?
"I put his hair inside the wax coffin, buried it in the graveyard."
That's ridiculous!
You wanna raise the dead?
But you can't kill people with voodoo. sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword.
You speak to my wife again and I will kill you.
Oh my god!
No!
Daddy!
Bad girl
I failed him. no!
"Milk, water, and dates"
"Allah akbar Allah Akbar, I can't hear pass them water"
(Laughter of cousin holding camera)
Shut up cocho... more laughing from camera guy...
Go for it!
Go for it!
I'm gonna pay you another 20 pesos
Go for it cochaso.
Go for it cochaso.
Look the work is waiting
"Go for it, get it out so you .."
"Oh yeah, that's it."
Echo of voices ...
Sounds of birds calling...
older worker talking to boy...
La verga (look it up in a spanish/english dictionary)
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
But you have to keep it a secret and return it at the end of the year.
All right.
So now you know.
Good luck.
"- - lf you believe in magic - - - Ooh, magic -"
- Don't you bother to choose if it's jug band music or rhythm and blues -
- Just go and listen It will start with a smile -
- That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try -
- Your feet start tappin' and you can't seem to find how you got there -
- Do you believe in magic --**
- Scooby-dooby doo bah scoo-scooby-dooby dooby-dooby doo bah -
"- Yeah, magic --**"
What was that ?
"- Uh, sorry."
"- No, it was good."
"Well, it, uh-- It came from the heart."
"Well, keep it coming."
"All right, people, good work !"
"Now, don't forget."
"The state competition's a couple of weeks away, so keep on it, okay ?"
"Not bad, Chris."
Really ?
"Thanks, uh, Heather, right ?"
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
"So, you've got this sort of Frank Sinatra thing going on."
[ Chuckles ]
Right.
I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.
"I mean, uh, music is so expressive."
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.
"No, let's take him right in."
( suspenseful theme playing )
"Is he gonna hurt me, Frank?"
Maybe a little.
"But you're a brave boy, aren't you?"
"Will you stay with me, Frank?"
"Yeah, sure I will."
( dramatic theme playing )
"Yes, yes."
We're at Dr. Garber's office now.
"No, no."
I don't think it's serious.
Probably nothing but a simple sprain.
We'll take an x-ray at the hospital to be sure.
We're going over to the hospital.
Why don't you meet us there?
"I-I know you're busy, but-but this is Saturday."
"All right, then you can just stay there."
It's only his son.
DR. GARBER:
"All right, young man, let's test that ankle."
How does it feel?
Okay.
Fine.
We'll have that arm fixed up in no time.
Would you want me to go with him?
"No, don't bother, Frank."
You can take the car back.
Dr. Garber will drop us off later.
"Then you'll tell me about it when you get home, huh?"
Frank... thank you.
You having trouble?
"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"
Listen..
Bhuta singh.. the police is right.
- Then?
This is the golden chance to serve our country.
You are so lucky.
- How?
Go with the police and get shekhar arrested.
And get myself killed! - shut up!
I will give the address.
You can serve your country.
Fine. send Ms. kitty in.
Did you call me?
"No, Ms. kitty."
Your good luck has called you.
- What?
The police are waiting for you outside.
- Police?
The police know that you are hiding here.
"Now I can""t hide you here for long."
There is only one way left for your escape.
So thank you for that.
"We can take one or two questions, but remembering we've got the forum."
Any questions?
We'll save it 'til then.
Great.
"- Esra, I've heard you're replacing Luciel  by taking care of Mrs. van de Berg."
- Yeah.
- I know some of you don't think it's such a good idea  but this is what Sander and I decided.
"I promise you, I won't be in your way."
- Hidde is doing well.
"Corien, thank you for acting  so determinedly."
It was hardly a pleasant situation.
"Let's see, to wrap things up..."
"Oemaima, you're off to see Esmee and her baby."
Please don't start any arguments this time.
- I don't start arguments.
- Oh well great.
Then I'm done nagging.
Get to work everybody.
- Wait.
Wait.
No motto for today?
- Yeah of course.
"Take care of other, but mostly of yourself."
- Ah beautiful!
Hi everybody!
Welcome to CS 215.
"My name is Micheal Littman, and I'm going to be your instructor."
Let's get off with a little magic trick.
All right!
Here is a collection of actors from movies.
"This is Bruce Willis, Danny Devito, Cloris Leachman, Stanley Tucci,"
No more bedroom!
"Hello, Mr. Rajesh!"
"- How are you, Mr. Diwan?"
I am fine.
You tell me.
What news have you brought?
The news is that today constable seized 1500 gm of gold.
Well done!
1500 gm of gold!
Dharamdas Tiwari has given the statement that.. ..his boss shekhar gave him this gold! shekhar?
Yes!
My best friend and your son-in-law!
"We are forced to doubt him, Mr. Diwan."
Mr. Rajesh.. so what if he is my son-in-law?
"Even if my child had been a culprit.. ..still I wouldn""t have been lenient."
Thanks.
This is what I expected from you.
We received the news that shekhar is returning tomorrow from.. ..flight number Boc 3796.
I have posted clDs at different places. so that we receive the information. okay.
I need one more favour from you.
- Tell me.
You go to receive shekhar at the dockyard.
And keep a close watch on his luggage. so that we can arrest the culprit along with the evidence.
"Welcome, boss. okay, boss! cheers!"
"Welcome, boss!"
- Hello.
"Welcome home, Tiger singh!"
Diamonds!
Diamonds!
- Diamonds! very good! very good!

All real! very good! very good!
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
"And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice"
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life
[dramatic music playing]
-(reporter) The carnage continues today as yet another body was found.
This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
-(announcer) This summer... get ready... the rivers are gonna run red.
[crash!]
-Ah!

"Go, he's gaining on us!"
Step on it!

"-I'll teach you to make fun of me, Dane Cook."
Heads up!
-Ah!
lf they had their way they will sell God.
lnternational crook. crook. crook.
lnternational crook.
Bhuta singh!
- Yes!
Do you want to lose your life?
- No!
"lf you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life!"
No!
- Listen!
- Yes!
Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."
"lf you didn""t come out till I count 5.. ..then we will kill the child!"
1 .. 2.. ..3..
No!
Give me my child!
Leave him!
Leave him!
No!
"I won""t let this happen!"
Did Jamie take care of him?
He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
"Well, you should try again."
What did you do to me?
You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?!
"She'll be fine, too."
"Bonnie, listen to me."
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why?
"Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself."
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
"Bonnie, please."
I've almost got it.
Abby hasn't called yet.
"Jamie, please, just let us go."
No!
"Please, don't do anything."
"Look, I don't know why I shot him."
"I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything,"
I'm going to shoot him again.
"Ok, I won't."
Who gave you that gun?
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
Could she have gone there for another reason?
Why do you always think aboutthe worst and ugliest possibilities?
"- Abla, you are being over optimistic.- Come on, please."
Don't we all know Meltem?
What are you talking about Hilmiye...
"Tell me, didn't we know our own kids?"
Nothing surprises me anymore.
- Nothing...- Selim will be devastated if he learns about it.
- Don't tell him anything about it.- Of course we can't say such a thing to him.
Shall we change the music?
"- It's my turn now.- Floor is yours, abi."
"- Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?- She's there."
Thank you.
"Good evening, Fatmagül Ilgaz?"
Give me it.
- From him?- Give me that.
What is it?
"Abla, give it to me."
"""I'll send you my best wishes."
"At exactly 10 p.m."""
"""All together, to many happy years."
"Mustafa."""
"- God damn it, God damn it!- What is it?"
"Hurray, hurray!Dad look!"
It's amazing!
"Kerim Abi, is this your present then?"
Hey stop!Stop!
Fatmagül.
Don't cry.
My birthday has been ruined as well.
Is this how it's gonna be?Will my happiness always be left unfinished?
"Don't let it demoralize you, Fatmagül."
"Look, there's a crime here and the guilty ones will get their punishment."
- And you?
"- I said ""anyone guilty""."
We told everything to a friend of yours.
All right?
"Kerim Bey, what did you do with the money?"
Bought this car?
I'm wasting my breath with you.
You're a waste of time!
"Kerim Bey, please!"
"I'm sorry, Usta."
They are in front of our house as well.
- They are everywhere now.
- But that's a bit over the top.
What did I tell you before?
All I care about is my business.
- I don't want this in front of my shop.
- You're right.
"You're right, but it's not like  I'm calling them to come here."
"What the hell, man?"
- Damn it.
- Kerim...
This won't go on.
It's so troublesome to have you here.
"I promised your dad, but... ..."
I can't continue with you any more.
What did you promise to my dad?
- Don't go and tell the man now.
"- No, I just want to now."
Did my father tell you to give me the job?
I'm sorry...
I have a daughter who is to be married.
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
I'll be 'the last but not least Snow Maiden'!
"And I will, I beg your pardon, be Santa."
Then that makes me the Christmas tree.
That's right!
"And we will decorate you, and dance the round dance around you."
"What will we dance, I beg your pardon?"
Ooh!
The round dance.
"The boa's home is Africa, ln Africa he lives, -"
"So cute, and slim, and ever-green, Just like the summer leaves."
Why - green?
Because I'm a Christmas tree.
You won't make a Christmas tree.
And why is that?
Why won't he?
A Christmas tree is prickly.
And he is soft.
A Christmas tree has to have needles.
Ha!
We can stick needles into him.
"Oh no, don't stick needles into me!"
The parrot is right:
I won't make a Christmas tree.
Then we don't have a Christmas tree?
But we have the Snow Maiden and Santa Claus.
We don't have Santa Claus either.
Santa is cold.
"And the elephant - there, feel him - he is warm."
We'll freeze him!
There!
No!
Please don't freeze me!
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
See?
"It feels like someone else is touching them, not your own hands, right?"
- Wow.
Freakilicious.
"- Oh, I could get used to this."
I don't think we should be doing this.
It's kind of lesbiany.
"Well, you asked me what it was like to be felt up."
"So, what's the best thing about having a boyfriend then?"
It just feels really natural.
"You know, really grown up."
And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.
The Ten Stages of Snogging.
- You're mad.
- No.
It's scientific.
- How would you know anything about it?
- Please.
- Who got 82% in Bio?
- True.
We cut out all the letters about kissing from the problem pages of every girls' magazine.
I had a chance to be somebody else.
"To be Abby Wilson, the woman..."
"Not Abby Bennett, the witch."
"I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie."
I ran.
I know I ran.
"But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it..."
Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know?
What?
Oh.
How?
We were doing a rough spell...
And we both exhausted ourselves.
Her more than me.
"Well, she raised you right."
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
"Well, now you know my whole story."
Yep.
How about you tell me yours?
What brings you to me?
"It was a dream, actually."
I thought you were supposed to help us.
"But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
"Well, no spells, no."
But I'm not completely useless.
"I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such."
There might be something I can do.
I...Don't think so.
"Bonnie, please."
Let me help you.
"So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
(laughs)
"I'll get you, Patman!"
Principal Cooper.
"Egbert, stop that horseplay and get to class."
Can I quote you on that?
"Thank you, Mr. Superintendent."
"Elizabeth, you're here late."
Just doing some fact-checking for my audition tape.
"Well, I know you'll do a great job."
"You asked for it, Patman."
(hissing)
"(Manny) Hey, Bruce, wait up."
Want to get something to eat?
(Bruce) Great idea.
"So, why do you want to get involved with this Oracle show, anyway?"
"I want to do the editorials, share my opinions."
I feel like owe it to these simpletons to tell them how to think.
"Hey, you're the man."
Of course.
What about the audition tape?
Done deal.
Made a call.
I'm bringing in the best director money can buy.
(coughs)
"Good morning, Sweet Valley High."
"Today's top story... 3, 2..."
*♪ I've got some news for you*
*♪ I am the one you need...*
Missing school fund discovered.
After a recent probe into the school department's budget...
Go again.
"OK, take 14! *♪ I've got the perfect story* missing $5,000 fund..."
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
Don't wait here then go mind your business.
Don't worry this much about me.
"- Is where you will go, a near place?"
- No.
It's not like Kuzey will reply to your letter right away.
"I'll leave you alone, but it's best if I go now."
It is best.
You could wait.
How are you gonna go from here?
"It's okay, I saw a taxi stand near here."
Want me to walk there with you?
"Okay, as you wish."
- Goodbye.
- Bye bye.
Annoying.
"Sorry, for making you having to put up with this."
It's clear enough for me.
You don't have to explain anything.
"If I tried to explain it would take ages, anyway."
I have no hurry.
I will get to know you guys slowly.
- My son!
- Don't leave your seat.
- Hoşgeldiniz.
"- Hoşbulduk, my son."
"The air is damp, it could rain any minute."
"- You won't start will you, mom."
"- No, son."
I won't cry this time.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks to God."
How are you guys?
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.
[Song:
Kimseye Etmem Şikayet Singer:
Şevval Sam]
Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.
Parker!
"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!
"Parker, you're late, man."
Always late.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz."
I have been waiting for this day for so long!
You always wait for bad days.
But not me!
Let me tell you!
"I won""t get seema married to him!"
Listen..
Lajwanti!
You know they are childhood friends!
They like each other!
To hell with that!
I have always been against this relationship!
And I will always be against it!
"More than me, you will regret it."
"Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance""s.. ..and not my alliance."

"But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"
"What""s my fault?"
"I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."
"Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."
Who are you to take decision of my destiny?
lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!
"But I can""t kill my love like this!"
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
What do I love the most?
Well... you're looking at her.

"No, Prince Yuning."

That won't happen.
What's with the long face?
Guess you're not glad to see me.
"No, not at all."
I'm really REALLY glad to see you.
Then why do you look so depressed?
"Look, you haven't even called me, 'Brother.'"
It's just...
I thought maybe you didn't want to see me again.
What?
"You went through lots cause of me, though."
"No, cause of you?"
Where'd that come from?
It was my idea to skip out.
But you told Father it was yours.
"Listen, you're the one that's had it tough because of me."
I'm really sorry.

Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
This is Dayton Way in Beverly Hills.
It's actually a very expensive town.
"I don't fit in very well, do l?"
&amp;lt;'Bear' Yong Guk's shoot begins&amp;gt;
The background saved me.
It's like L.A.
It looks fantastic.
Feels like L.A. here.
Pictures come out beautifully here.
Nature is definitely better than creating expensive sets.
No matter how costly a set is it's incomparable to nature.
okay.
Great job.
"Now, it's Zelo's turn."
The first scene is a wrap.
Zelo will now be shooting a skateboarding scene.
Zelo will film something similar to me.
Directors are so good at filming.
They're making us look very attractive.
We look as though we're Korean-Americans living in America.
I'm pretending this iPod is an iPhone.
"Woah there, wind."
None
I'm doomed.
My face is bloated.
I can feel my face all swollen.
I'm screwed.
I think that's a person over there.
Look at him wash the baby like she's laundry.
(Born in Busan) I've been to Gwang-an-ri Beach in Busan.
"Hae-woon-dae, and Song-do beach."
But I've never been to such a huge beach like this before.
No
No one smells anything
I definitely smell a chicken
"Alright, man."
I wanna clean fight Let's get it on
Wait a minute is he gonna use those gloves
What's wrong with my gloves
"Well, won't they get in the way of all the scratching and slapping? *"
You're gonna rock his world.
Punish him.
You're the man
Good luck
Come on.
Stuart
"You're like a wild animal, aren't you"
"Well, how am i supposed to fight you if you keep running around like a sissy?"
A sissy
Yeah
Is he down
How good of a friend is he?
"Actually, we're very tight, but I'm totally ok with you beating the crap out of him."
"Come on ,Dorothy"
Is that all you got? here comes one from macy's basement.
"1,2,3,4....."
Don't sweat this.
Only 14 more rounds to go. here we go!
"How are you doing, Stuart, alright."
How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
Will it lead Pasha on the gallows?
Yes!
Definitely he will.
Never.
Because you'll withdraw your statement.
"I spent 35 years of my life, listening to the... ...threatening from the boys like you."
"If I wish, I can kill your entire family in just five minute."
But you've a big family.
And it's in your hands to let it prosper.
It was my duty to warn you.
"So, I have."
You are lucky that my gun is under maintenance today.
Your darling daughter Radha.
"Stop, Shreekant."
I've no one in my family.
But you've many.
Think about it.
19 days are left for you to give your statement.
"Santo, let's go."
Hail Lord Krishna!
"- Lord, what a festival!"
Hail Lord Krishna!
"Uncle, we must leave for Mumbai now."
Never!
Shreekant Mathur has never got... ...afraid of anyone's threat nor will he in future.
"Thank God, Damodar isn't here today."
"Otherwise, he'd have started firing."
"Let go off it,"
I know Damodar.
He's just a police officer by profession.
"Otherwise, he's very soft hearted person."
Inspector Damodar!
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
"He wouldn't say ""See you later"" slowly unless he means ""See you later."""
"Otherwise he would just say ""See ya later."""
- Don't you get it?
- When is later then?
I don't know.
I'm not boy lingual yet.
But I tell you what.
I see a snog at the end of the tunnel.
Big fish little fish cardboard box
Big fish little fish cardboard box Fill the trolley fill
"Lindsay, stop it."
You don't have to come.
"Oh, Robbie, stop."
I promise I won't get in the way.
"Oh, no."
"I don't mind, honestly."
Come on.
"Lindsay, stop messing about there."
All right?
Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.
"Oh, Robbie."
Maybe they're just mates.
"Don't be a plonker, El."
Mates don't hold hands.
"I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet."
I don't know how she got in there before you.
- I can never compete with Lindsay.
"- Yes, you can."
You've got much better qualities than her.
Yeah?
Like what?
"- Well, you're really funny."
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
"What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?"
"Pretty swanky, are they not?"
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you... ...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
"Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it."
"Oh, and it turned out BEAUTlFUL, don't you think?"
"Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy."
It just sings spring!
"And Pinkie Pie, look!"
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
-They're...
"-Yeah, they're..."
They sure are...
-...sumth'n.
-Yes!
Something.
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
Here it is.
That's right.
"This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia."
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
"Here we are at six, which is burned out."
Just your basic Dover elevator.
"For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator."
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right.
Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray:
You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha.
"So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man."
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.

"Just bullshit, man."

[alarm beeping]
[rooster crows]
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."

It's going to be about German industry norms.
"I wish you good luck, I hope it's going to be perfect!"
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
That was a mistake!
Nobody checks the handicapped sticker.
"Mom, we're just not comfortable with it."
"Yeah, and it's a really expensive ticket, by the way."
"Well, I got a bum knee and a broken vagina."
Ticket that!

MOTHER'S DAY
"Good afternoon, welcome to the El Fuerte..."
What's good about it?
Sorry!
It was a long drive.
Ha ha ha!
"Um, we have our registration."
You got room in the trash for Mama?
Unless you want my crust.
"Trust me, you don't want that."
My sister and I are on the list.
"And, um, we have our mom with us today."
Does she have a reservation with us?
I have a reservation about your haircut.
It should be under Turner.
P F-ing U!
Either something died in this...
"Ma, I'll put you back in the car so fast."
Oh G-d!
"Catch a disease, nonsense..."
"Alright, we won't be disturbed here"
"Thank you, Loulou"
"Ohlala, I need to pee, I need to pee"
Go
Is it coming yet?
"Oh, that's good"
"Careful with the pants, though"
"Stop talking to me, you're distracting me!"
It's coming alright?
"Yes, it is!"
"Great, byyyeeeee"
"No, Jean!"
"Stop, Jean, stop!"
It's been a long time since we last went to a club!
Huh?
"I was saying, it's been a long time since we last went to a club!"
Yeah yeah
"Brings back memories, hmm?"
Yeah yeah
Which memories does it bring back?
Yeah!
Alright well I'm going to hit on every guy here and sleep with the first one I meet
"Jean, go screw yourself!"
Cool
"But, Loulou, can you hear what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, yeah, you told me to go screw myself and that you were gonna sleep with the first guy you meet"
"Alex, just because the music is loud doesn't mean what you're saying suddenly became interesting, you see?"
It's boring
Do you have a mint?
Want one?
"No, that's for you"
Look.
What's he doing?
- What..
"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.
- Nah.
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.
It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."

"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.

Her phone is turned off.

Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.

"Your style is fabulous today, Tae Ik."

"No! shekhar.. till the time I don""t see the gold.. ..l can""t believe you."
You doubt the party.
Forget all this!
We have been exposed.
The police are searching everywhere.
Anything can happen in the future!
Even thieves should be honest! shekhar!
"I don""t tolerate my humiliation!"
"Tiger too can""t tolerate disobedience!"
What do you care?
"I can""t work in this party!"
"I can""t work in this syndicate! settle my account!"

A big deal!
What deal?
"Whose message is this? sheikh.. king of smuggler""s message!"
"What""s the message?"
"Gold worth crores are coming to lndia from Bangkok. very good! chhota sheikh, very good!"
Now you people will have to seize the gold from the ship!
But.. nobody besides Tiger can do this.
"The syndicate is broken, kaka sir! chhota sheikh, where are you going?"
Talk about the deal with me.
- How can l?
"lts syndicate""s rule that the deal.. ..should be discussed only with Tiger."
Goodbye!
"Tell me, sheikh!"
"Tiger singh, kaka sir pleaded a lot with me."
"But I didn""t pay any heed."
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Welcome to Tea Time.
(whispering) I have something really important to tell you.
(whispering) So come close.
(whispering) Closer.
(whispering) Closer ... (whispering) Ok!
(whispering) Today.
Is.
My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.

Amy:
Oh no!
DG:
Good morning!
"I'm Professor Vacinski, Director General of CERN."
DG:
This meeting has been called because last night there was an emergency beam dump.
(Crowd whispers furtively)
DG:
Here we see a monopole magnet in LHC Sector 7G.
DG:
Beam sensors have detected that an unknown event caused this magnet to quench and triggered an uncontrolled shut down.
DG:
If this happens again the results could be catastrophic.
DG:
"Due to the special circumstances, Dr. Niven is taking a team into the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause, and see what damage there is."
The LHC will be in shut down until at least the end of the week.
DG:
Since Dr. Niven will not be available we will need 4 volunteers to be on shift in the control room.
Connor:
We'll do it.
Amy:
(Quietly) What are you doing?!
DG:
"Ok, you four."
Lisa:
"Oh, I'm going to be at a conference in Barcelona."
DG:
"Uh, very well."
You... you then.
Matt:
"Uh, I have an analysis note due this week, so I'm not going to have time to do this..."
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, always stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .
I can tell with the others as well.
"Uh, I missed the update, so you do have essential training in teacher twelve, not four, this came out the,"
"February, the fifteenth."
Yeah.
"So I do, I did have not."
All right.
And we.
"Yeah, I just realized that, I'll have to go back take a look at that again."
"And we have um, finished shooting, um."
"Uh, course the shooting with the Nikon D800."
So that will come out in November.
"Oh, November."
"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So you can spend your um, your holidays."
Watching movies.
Okay.
Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
Where's the fourth?
Show me!
"Well, ehh, here's the thing."
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do?
"Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up."
"I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one."
I will tear you limb from limb.
"And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest."
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to?
You talked to Damon.
"Yeah, I did."
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
"Well, he drinks it, every day."
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
"I'm not crazy, Ric."
Really?
Then what are you?
Watch your back.
You really want to know?
Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes?
Aaah!
I'm just trying to help!
"Just get it out, Elena, please."
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!
My mother had given this locket to me in my childhood.
Radha!
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."
"You are a hero!"""
"Yes, Damodar!"
"Uncle, Jackie has surrendered!"
- What?
"""You can take away my youth..."""
"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""
"""Wonder what could have happened in these 16 days."""
"""That young boy... and this young girl."""
"Aunt, stop it now."
"Since yesterday, we've cried enough."
Don't make her cry more.
Why would I do that?
Society will make her cry when they'll refuse her alliance.
"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.
""" ln my body. """
""" Don't look now. """

""" This sight looks so colourful. """
""" You're so talked about, you're so unique. """

""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Just one more place left to visit.
Mishra.
You call me from Kashi for a day.. ..and make me travel the entire day.
It's a small area.
Once you give them your blessings.. ..they'll cast their votes for me.

"Look, Sonakshi Sinha."
"She is Rowdy, my Rathore's in the next alley."
Let's go.
Come on.
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
There are so many careless drivers in the world.
I have seen many different sizes of fly.
"In North Africa, smaller fly than here."
"And Turkey, smaller fly than here."
But this size is same fly in Korea and in Japan and China.
So I feel very emotional.

I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!

Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.

You have runny nose.
"Here, wipe it off."
"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.
It's not coming out...
Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
"Yes, I'd be doing them a favor."
I'd be doing good.
Yes.

"Which way do I go? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you go in that direction, you will die.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You shouldn't go there!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
Such a smarty!
Is that important?
This story should be... a mystery with a fabulous ending.
"Popular these days, you know."
For example...
"In reality, the one scribbling was an alien."
No wait... better make it an angel.
"Huh? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The angel, helps an ignored kid to find his friend&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by scribbling all over the street.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Add the foreshadowing by showing a glimpse of a feather.
"And at the end, Voila!"
"The angel appears, angel!"
Oh my...
Stop pretending to be nice.
"How, can you smile like that in front of me!"
Stop there!
Okay... who can tell us what the problem is here?
"Come on, she's shaking."
Maybe she's got her phone on vibration mode.
"So awkward, even for the audiences."
Who are you?
Never seen you before.
Yes!
"A third-year Taekwondo major, my name is LEE Ji-hwan!"
"Heard that, as an acting teacher you are the best in the country"
So I dared to sneak into your class!
Such a dignity for someone sneaking in!
Sure.
But don't talk too much.
Quiet!
"Yes, thank you very much."
"Yo, LEE Ji-hwan!"
Concentrate!
"If you won, our model will won."
"And with it's victory, the company will win."
"Your house will be made, your dream house."
Wow!
What a horoscope!
Planets are very firm at their positions... ...facing some obstacles too... ...which means the girl is very adamant.
- That's right.
She'll do love marriage.
Boy's name will start with J.
That means Jimmy.
- Yes.
"This year, the boy will take part in some air competition... ...and win the first prize."
And he'll earn fame in the world.
He'll be her husband.
Air competition?
"Yes, I remember."
Motor cycle race.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
And there's going to be a motorcycle race.
I stood first in Singapore for consecutive 3 years.
And I'll definitely take part in this race.
"Yes, son and do come first."
This is a question of our reputation.
Yes.
This race is of 30 miles distance from Mumbai to Panvel.
And 21 motorbikes across the world are taking part.
"Number 9, Mr. Jaikishan from Escort."
"Motorbike, Rajdoot 350."
Number 16.
Mr. Jimmy Thapa from Singapore.
Jimmy!

"Tell Raman that the gold will be delivered tomorrow morning! okay, sir! - okay!"

Gold and watches worth lakhs were seized!
"Were any men nabbed? - sir, five!"
Where is the group?
"Why didn""t you bring them here? very sorry, sir."
Presenting corpses is illegal. shut up!
Listen! - sir!
Where was that call from?
"- From Alibagh, sir! shift our headquarters there immediately."
"- Right, sir! very good idea, sir!"
The police should keep a tab on the culprits.
"And the culprits should keep a tab on the police. so that it""s easy for both of them."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir!"
Will you please shut up?
And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."
AB:
What year would you like?
CA:
1824.
AB:
"1824, OK."
AB:
And what month?
CA:
June.
AB:
June what?
CA:
Sixth.
AB:
Was that a Sunday?
CA:
It was.
AB:
And it was cloudy.
(Laughter)
"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
"We'll transfer youhere in the morning,is rapidly recovering."
Nurse...

"A quick recoveryMahir, good luck,"
Speedy recovery.
We're very worried.

"No, my friends,Thank you."
How long will youstay in the hospital
"I do not know what the doctors say,But today's my father s hearing"
And I havebe there as a witness.
"How are you going to go,Mahir?"
I have to ..
I have to go and join my fatherat the hearing to set him free .
Good morning.
"the court hearings is today, right?"
Why are you so nervous...
You'll see Mahirand his family .. surely I have been informed about it...
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him ..
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him...
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!
Gomi!
The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
- Is that so?
- I'm sorry.
It must have been precious to you.
"No, it's alright."
"It was used to save lives, so I'm sure its owner would have been glad too."
But the frame should still be there.
I should go find it.
At this hour?
You should go when it's light.
That's alright.
I'll be going now.
You're really as impetuous as he said you were.
He?
Do I know that person?
Everyone's gone now.
We should go too.
"Gil Dong, do you want to wear this and go to the brothel for a while?"
- Shall we?
- No one will recognize us if we wear this!
You're right.
I haven't been to the brothel in a long time!
I am filled with past memories!
- Then I'll wear the black.
- Go ahead.
"I look great, don't I?"
"Are you sure you'll be alright, half-balls?"
You may be ready for the brothel yet.
Let's just go back.
How do I look?
Let's just wear this to scare the kids.
- You handsome fellow!
"- Hey, Sir Moonlight Black Hat!"
My legs. . .I cannot climb a mountain.
Can't my legs be cured?
"Ofcourse dear, your legs will get cured."
You have me.
Why do you think I drive the rickshaw?
I'll collect lots of money.
I'll get you treated by the best doctor in the world.
"You will walk, run, walk in step with the world."
Can't you see?
Are you blind?
Who did you call blind?
Me?
"You are blind, your father is blind. . . your whole family is blind."
Why are you looking there and talking?
I am here.
"Wherever you may be, for me, you are here."
I'll thrash you !
"I'm sorry sister, did I hurt you?"
"- That's a pole, not a lady."
"I know it is not a lady, it is a pole."
You mind your own business.
What's wrong with the municipality?
They put up poles everywhere.
It's quite a huge pole - Are you blind?
"I am not a pole, I am a woman."
Woman?
"I'm sorry sister, I made a mistake Forgive me."
I think he is mad too.
Someone help me cross the road.
- Who is this?
I am blind.
Help me cross the road.
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
Is it him?
I thought you guys split.
I sent him a message that I was in the hospital.
"You really like him, don't you?"
I don't know why I'm like this...
Wow this room is warm.
Wait.
I'm sorry about last time.
"Damn, look at your wounds."
"I told myself...that this is the last time so if you have something to say, please say it."
The last time?
Then why don't we do it for the last time before we go on our way?
Don't worry.
I can be careful so you won't get hurt.
Like this....
I went to an inn in the country and the woman next doorways screaming like crazy.
- I cracked the door to listen to her.
- Not interesting.
Not interesting?
Then I'll tell you another story.
Let's just do it once.
"A long time ago, I was going up the mountain..."
A woman...
Don't call me again.
"Fine, we don't have to see each other again."
Let's do it for the last time.
Come on!
Fine.
Do it.
Then do it.
Okay.
"A long time ago, I was going up this mountain..."
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."
Sure.
"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.
"Mom, I'm home !"
[ Chattering ]
[ Moaning ]
[ Moaning Continues ]
"Oh, yeah."
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
It says Amy's biosim just finished.
James:
Oh.
James:
So?
Amy:
So I was right about Higgs radiation...
Matt:
Does your conscience bother you?
"Now, tell the truth - Alabama!"
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
"Lord, I'm coming home to you"
Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
"Peter, tell us about yourself."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
"Well, shouldn't you know?"
"I mean, who would know?"
Leave him alone.
Maybe is a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside... ...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But is hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
"I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy."
"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
Thas right.
I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
"Yes, you do."
I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
"But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry."
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie...
Brightest green were all her garments...
And her hair was like the sunshine...
Day by day he gazed upon her...
Rent!
Where is my money?!
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
I'm sorry that I cannot touch your feet as my arm is wounded.
It's not necessary.
- Why not?
I had left with your blessings so I returned alive.
"No, my son."
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life for their country.
What did aunty say?
I've got it.
Wonderful!
Your words have strengthened my determination.
Do you know what my mother would have said?
"What have you done, my son?"
I told you not to join the defence services.
You are my only son.
"You were saved this time but, what will happen the next time?"
And then she would start crying.
For the sake of her child a mother has to cry sometime.
Some shed tears and some swallow their tears.
"What is the matter, aunty?"
Nothing.
"Aunty, can I ask you something?"
Don't you have any children?
I had a son.
He wasjust like you.
I lost him.
Your mother has come to see you.
"Please send her in, doctor."
I'll leave now.
- Why?
You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.
"Renu, you stay here."
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.
Loooook!
These are our wedding pictures.
"You are the groom, I am the bride."
Whole Guzelyurt was there.
Everybody admired the gold jewellery given to me.
They said this land had not seen such a beautiful bride for years...
"Yes, take a good look at me."
Do you remember you hit me?
I wanted you to give me a present to see my unveiled face...
And you hit me in the face.
Mustafa Bulut...You are something...
You can't run away like this...
You will remember each one of them...
And then you will answer to me.
I won't forgive you unless you kiss ten times every part of my body you hit.
Welcome... and good bye.
Visiting time is over.
"Today, there were too many people coming and going."
"Mustafa brother, it is time for your medication."
You are loved by beautiful women.
One comes while the other leaves.
Mustafa...
"Where are you going, son?"
Mustafa...
Please look at me.
Son...
My child...
"Hug your father once, eh?"
Hug your father...
Mustafa held the sling and you should have seen it...
Everybody in the garden dispersed.
But he had already set his eyes on someone.
What sort of parents do you think we are?
- Do you really want me to answer that?
"- That's enough, missy."
- Why would we damage you?
- We made you.
"Honestly, Georgia, this attitude is..."
Welcome to the tragic universe that is my sad life.
Why?
I'll give you five major reasons why.
"Number one, my parents are from the Stone Age."
"- No us, no you."
- God knows what you'd do.
- You understand?
You wouldn't exist.
- Yeah.
"Number two, they hate me having a life 'cause theirs are practically over and mine's just starting."
- And it's not good enough.
- Honestly.
Every year it's...
- Number three. ...a performance...
My little sister's bonkers.
Poor Angus will need even more therapy than me.
- A lot of trouble! ...because of your fifteenth birthday...
- Number four... ...it's not good enough. - ... my nose is the size of Jupiter. ...so ungrateful.
- I need to go into an ugly home.
"- Georgia, what have you gone and done now?"
How did you manage to pluck them all so quickly?
"You haven't, have you?"
"Oh, crikey."
"Bob, she shaved them."
"Number five, I'll never get a boyfriend."
What's the hurry with growing up so fast?
"Oh, Gary McDonough."
His mother just died when he was in Florida.
He retired from GM and he was down there.
They're all pretty much retired.
"Caroline, she married a real nice guy"
He started off as a mechanic for the school district of the county just south of
Travers City.
He was running it years and years ago.
He was the head guy running the - he knew stuff.
He knew engines.
Nice guy.
So that worked out.
But now they spend their summers over there someplace.
They get back here once in a while.
They have something in Florida.
So the whole bunch is pretty good.
Sally's got this...
Nice girl.
She could ice skate.
She was a good ice skater.
Did the fancy stuff.
We skated out one time
I think it was [?] and Gary and myself.
February.
"And like one of them two week old ice, where it froze yay thick."
We went out after school and it was cold.
Where?
Out in the - just ice skating out towards Grey's Reef
The harbor?
Towards [?].
"And we got out there and - beautiful, just"
"like shotguns going off, when the ice cracks, when it's freezing, you know."
Kona Ranga Rao becomes crores Ranga Rao.
I am placing my daughter in your hands.. ..you should make her a star and change my fate.
Do you have a five star cigarette?
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.
"Yes, my difficulties have become a joke for you."
Tell as what they are.
There are two matches.
One girl is very beautiful.
She likes me too.
But she does not have any money.
The other girl is average in looks.
But she is very wealthy
What is there in money?
You are lucky to find a girl who likes you.
Marry that girl who is not rich and you will be happy.
You are what I call a friend.
Now tell me the address of that which girl.
Give me water!
Someone close to you is remembering you.
Why do they remember even when they are close?
"Because they are close, they will remember.. ..either when close by or when far away."
Is that so?
"Hey, these people are getting very close."
It is better that we go away.
"Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!"
Oh!
My father!
Where is your father?
There.
Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?
She's of use to me.
Come here.
Go catch her.
Go!
Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.
- But how will I climb a mountain?
"I-I mean, the scars healed really well."
"- Hey, Stifler."
- Eat shit.
What was that all about ?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that ?
"What do you mean, ""no comment"" ?"
- Did you two hook up or something ?
"- What, are you kidding ?"
No.
Then how did all this get started ?
"Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now."
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
"Cheese, please."
"Finch comes up to me and says, ""Jessica,"
"I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."""
"So I said, ""All right."
"Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."""
"So he did, and I did."
- That actually works ?
"- Well, duh !"
Of course.
"Naturally, I embellished a little bit."
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman ?
[ Chuckling ]
"No, I didn't hear that one."
That one was my favorite.
[ Laughing ]
"Do that cheerleader. - - Thank you, baby - - She wants me."
She calls me up--
- How sweet it is to be loved by you --**
"Oh, my God, you're gay !"
Come and dance with us come on ... purge your demons!
How long are you going to stay drunk?
How would you prefer me?
Perhaps riding in the head of my four legions to meet him in battle?
For yet another victory celebration?
A true king is not a coward!
I am not a coward
I am merely a fool in exile with no place to hide except my wife's country
Enough!
Enough!
Everybody out!
Out
Be well
I trusted you
I believed in you
"I, l believed in your strength"
Could I have misjudged you?
You misjudged yourself
It may be your nature to see victory in defeat
"But it's not mine, I fear...l fear..."
I fear I can lead no more...
I should have died...l should have... where's my sword?
I had a sword...
I must die...
I must die with honor My men believed in me...
I must have it...
Stop it!
Give me my sword!
Give me my sword!
I must have my honor!
This is no honor!
ls this how you want them to remember you?
"ln my eyes, you are greatness"
"I'm here, I'm here with you"

"I've conquered a great country, a great Queen"
It's my wish that you accompany me to Rome
So you can walk me behind your chariots...you Egyptian prize?
Octavius' trophy?
"That would do, yes"
"I answer to no earthly superior, much less a mortal like yourself"
I am a goddess!
I am immortal!
"Ah yes, the Daughter of lsis"
You and I are very much alike
"Compelled to follow our own natures, fulfill our destinies"
"But I have won, Cleopatra And you will come to Rome!"
- It's okay.
- Cemre and Zeynep are also waiting downstairs.
They didn't let them inside either.
They're waiting at the door.
Cemre came here to make an appearance?
What business does she even have here?
Her husband is the one who  made them put you in here.
"Handan Hanım, let us not talk about things we don't know."
- They sent you letters.
- You brought them with you?
They will control them first.
Then you will have the letters.
Cemre also sent you some food and drinks.
"And Zeynep, some clothes."
We have only 15 minutes.
And we'll spend that talking about Cemre and Zeynep?
"Okay, don't start arguing again."
So?
"Is there any problems, anything bothering you here?"
"No, why would anything bother me?"
Thank God...
- It is fine.
- Stay away from the bad lot.
"Yes, son, you won't spend much time here."
Just make sure you don't get in trouble.
Just close your eyes and ears.
Don't let it happen like the last time.
"Okay, don't worry."
It's not the first time I end up here.
- I talk to your lawyer everyday.
"- Me too, son."
I call him everyday.

I'll finally get in the Justice guild in exchange of this one of a kind item.

We will be the fellowship of the staff.

I said that she would be no longer where you look at  and you would see only me.
"Look, I am here now."

The way we can square on most calculators --
"let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"" and on most calculators that will give you the square."
"On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an ""x squared"" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster."
"What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method."
"What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,"
I will try and race you to the answer.
OK?

I don't like any!
How boorish coming to a motel and talking about painters.
I went get drinks and even condoms.
You're angry.
I understand.
But you know what?
It'll be better to do it when we really want to do it.
I really want to do it
Then let's do it when we really really want to do it.
It wouldn't be hard doing it with you.
But the fantasy will be broken.
What fantasy?
Of a good friend!
A friend I can really talk to.
We talked for six months.
I don't think I've ever been happier.
Do you know what the worst kind of woman is?
Who acts like she's going to put out but doesn't.
Do you really want to do it?
Yes
"Then, do it with your mouth."
Maybe later.
When we want to do it.
Then.. do it with your hand.
Let's do it later.
I'll do it later for sure.
You can't even do it with your hand?
Oh my god.
Weren't you going to buy some mackerel?
No.
We have a lot of fish.
Have some.
"Do you have any idea, how many people from this town he took under his wings and gave jobs to?"
And Selim...
His father-in-law is a parliament member.
Now why would a reputable and popular family like that want to ruin all their reputation?
Why would they get involved in an incident like this?
It makes no sense!
It's absurd.
"Besides, Selim got engaged the night of that incident."
"He spent the whole night with us until he joined his fiancée, and..."
Don't make me talk more...
"That's why, you better listen to me and accept that ""everything happens for a reason""."
Forget about what happened...
Forget about Fatmagül.
Hey dad.
"Okay, I am on my way."
"OK, I'll be there."
Mustafa...
Stay out of trouble son.
"Good day, Mr. Prosecutor."
It's Lawyer Munir Telci.
Sorry to bother you this time of day.
Are you in your office?
"Yes, I'll visit you to make a complaint."
"Yes, did you see the local newspaper?"
"Yeah, don't ask."
Yes.
I'll be there soon.
Just leaving home.
"OK, thank you."
See you soon.
"Mom, Ebe Nine is here."
Mithat Bey.
"I am ASlAN, Man."
Who cares?
"Dude, Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole (Slap) Owwww.."
"""Bottom of the totem pole""?"
That is the most low self-esteem crap.
I have ever heard
This is a fact
The only people that say Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole are Asian guys!
I have never heard a girl go
I don't date Asian guys cuz they are
The bottom of the totem pole
Oh my god.
You are so right!
Never heard that before... from a girl
Asian guys!
Why are we so pessimistic?
We are smart
We are clean
We don't sweat a lot.
We are exotic.
We are super exotic!
Asian guys are really at the bottom of the totem pole which we are not it's not cuz we are ugly or cuz we smell bad
It's cuz we have little.....
Confidence
Yeah.
Confidence.
You..
"You were thinking something dirty,"
Weren't you?
"Asian guys, we need to stand up."
We need to stand up and... and be brave.
We need to stand up and grow a pair
- Do you think you got rid of Burak?
Is this how you thought of getting rid of him?
Shame on you.
Where did these come from?
What are these?
You wanted to kill Burak.
"God damn you, Barış."
You lied to me all along.
Where did they come from?
"Who gave you these, mom?"
A courier left them at the door.
God damn it.
We're going home.
The murderer has been found.
Put an end to this tension.
I think the killer is still out there among us.
- What does this mean?
- Burak hired that man.
"This way, not only he cleared his name from the accusations... ... but also, he can still claim that he's the victim."
- Why would he do that?
- That man absolutely hates us.
He wants to have us on a string.
But I won't take that.
I won't let that happen.
Don't rise yourself to the bait then.
"Either way, Burak will be in your life."
I am not very sure about that.
- I need to hang up.
- Is Ebru Hanım in her room?
"- She won't be here today, sir."
- Why?
I wasn't told the reason.
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.
Come on let us go.
- Now?
It can be seen only when it is raining.
Believe me.
Please come once.
It stopped to rain.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Should I tell you?
At least tell me when will we meet again.
Let us see when it again rains.
What is that?
Didnt you tell that the rain is uniting us?
If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.
Do you at least know his name?
"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
Eh?
Three... five times...
They are giving you ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy).
Very gently...
You should have seen the electric shocks that I was given...
You couldn't stand it even while watching.
This is nothing...
For seven years...
I was given electric shock.
They fried us with electricity in Diyarbakir prison.
I smelled the burning of my own flesh.
"They made us into human kabobs, Mustafa..."
And then what?
Don't you be afraid.
You don't die from electricity.
You die from loneliness.
You die if you are not loved...
"How did you get the rich Mustafa, eh?"
"Do you get a good tip, eh?"
Serve him well...
This is a whale family...
"Let's stay away from this piece of shit, Mustafa..."
"Yesterday, I was looking at old pictures..."
"Look what I found, Asil."
Look what Mustafa did.
"The world will never see another man like Musto, dude..."
I pushed him around the garden in his wheelchair for about an hour.
"Now, he is yours."
I'll go and check the tea house.
Sahan...
"Shame on you; put it back into your pocket, brother..."
You give it to the poor...
They made me scared.
"I'm coming to um, California in September."
Well it should be nice when you come. .

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way
"We kept keeping on, feelings were so strong"
Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You could always find a little more time
To show me I was number one
Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good

That's why I've been systemically trying to drive her away.

See.
That wasn't so bad.
All done.
I'm still puking every hour.
My fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
I don't know.
"Look, Dr. Benson wasmy mentor so don't that annoying thing."
What annoying thing?
You know when you talk.
Come on that's a little-

That belongs to me as well.
Yes.
I will have you thrown out of this house.
I know Indira very well now.
I will get an emergency declared on you.

Oh.. no.
He and my dad.. so this is how he is.
You threw a balloon at my father.
"My delicate, innocent and.."
Stop praising me.
And give them a reply.

What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?
Exactly...
"Exactly, in this way I had dropped the cup... ...when I heard about it for the first time."
"Actually, Mr. Shreekant, Jimmy clearly told me... ...that if they couldn't marry, they'll commit suicide."
Yes.
Yes.
"So, I'm thinking over it and you too must think All of us must think over it."
After all it's a question of our prestige.
What if they elope and do register marriage?
Then?
Then?
And what if they'll really commit suicide?
Then?
Tell them to commit suicide and you too do the same.
God!

"What nonsense is this, Damodar?"
"It's not nonsense, uncle."
It's a fact.
"Look, uncle."
It's difficult for me to speak the truth... ...and for you to hear it.
That's why I had to do this drama.
But it's true that Radha and that boy are really in love.
"Damodar, have you seen the boy?"
"Yes, of course."
Instead I know him.
I know him very well.
"Aunt, if we won't accept Radha's proposal... ...we may repent in future."
Damodar!
- Why will Damodar lie to us?
Boy is studying medicine in America.
But it's a lie
Not to them
So tell them the truth
If it helps you lie.

I thought we were going to lunch
Bennet.
We need to talk
"Yo, carter, I thought we agreed we wasn't gonna it's all right."
These are my friends.
So they know about us
"Oh, my god, it's a gay boxer"
Bennet. lightheavy
I had you pegged for cruiser.
"That's a good idea Stuart, taunt the professional ass kicker"
I'm not afraid of him.
I used to box in college
You're way out of your league
Does anybody else smell that?
You first go home.
- Let us go home.
"Ok, come on let us go."
Is that you?
- You remember me?
"Yes, are you from Warnagal?"
"No madam, I am from Vijayawada."
I came to Warangal to purchase vegetables.
My name is Venkat.
I studied polytechnic.
Height 62.
"Please tell me your name, address and other details."
Is it so urgent?
I dont want to miss again.
I am very sorry.
That day my father was in toilet.
With out knowing that I.
Leave that matter.
You must be tired by now.
"You are dancing till now from the moment we met, in my dreams."
I have to take you to my friends immediately.
That Jagan argues that no one is beautiful than Aiswarya.
He will shut his mouth if he sees you once.
Are you trying to impress me?
No madam.
I have already impressed you.
I think you like the rain very much.
Rain is my friend.
Correct madam.
It rained when we first met.
It is raining today also.
That means you friend rain is trying to unite us.. ..which means there is something between us.
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
The deal is done!
Wow!
Nice deal!
I will make the remaining arrangement!
Now you all can leave!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
"Let""s leave! so shekhar has sent you both here?"
To hell with shekhar!
"Now he is not capable, kaka sir!"
He has started killing his men!
"His intentions have turned bad, kaka sir! so why should we help him?"
"Right! lt""s futile to give milk to the snake. - correct!"
Where is the gold?
"Gold is safe wherever it is, kaka sir!"
You help us and take your share!
Fine!
"But let""s form a plan."
You sail your ship s.s verona in the direction of.. ..West 20 East 32 and station it there.
We will reach there.
We have to deliver the goods at Lakhaidi island.
Good!
Good!
Done!
Done!
"This is betrayal! kaka sir, we might be smugglers!"
"But that doesn""t mean that we put our country at stake!"
We ruin our country!
"And sell our motherland! kaka sir, can we sell our motherland?"
They will even sell garden and air.
They will even sell garden and air.
lf they had their way they will sell God.
Hi Victoria.
Did you work here at Western illinois University or somewhere else?
Victoria:
"I worked at Iowa State University, and I worked for the plant-introduction station at Iowa State University."
Beth Seaton:
"And this was on his US Department of Agriculture grant, correct?"
Victoria:
"Yes, it was."
Beth Seaton:
"So were you working with pennycress, too?"
Or were you working with a different crop?
[Text on screen:
"Victoria, student intern]:"
I was working with a bio-soil plant called camelina.
"And I was basically taking the diomorphic differences, which is the difference in the leaf shapes, and the morphologic measurements of camelina."
Beth Seaton:
Tell me about your internship.
What would you say was the most exciting part of it for you?
Victoria:
I got to work a little outside of my major.
I'm a biology major and chemistry.
And I'm focused more on the animal aspect.
"But I got to work more with the plant aspect of it, and I really enjoyed it."
Beth Seaton:
Hi Josh.
Josh:
Hello.
Beth Seaton:
Tell me a
little bit about your internship that you had with Dr. Phippen's
USDA grant this summer.
Josh:
Your testimony and your blessings.
How did you know the deceased  when he was still healthy and among us?
[Crowd:]
He was a good man!
- Do you testify that he was a good muslim?
- We do!
"Earthly or unworldly, materially and spiritually make all your rights halal to him."
Helal olsun.
Helal ediniz.
"- One more time, for God's blessings."
- Helal olsun.
"May God accept your prayers, your testimony and blessings for the deceased."
May he rest in peace.
It's a very fine piece.
Hand made.
Great craftsmanship.
But this alone don't mean much.
It is valuable only with its pair.
Otherwise it's just like a button.
Wish you could find the other one as well.
Then I wouldn't want to sell it.
"Anyway, maybe we'll find it."
If we can't...
Then my husband will keep it as a heirloom.
- Thank you.
"- Have a nice day, miss."
We've come with great news.
Is that so?
How nice.
The forward buyings are going great.
We revitalized the market.
- Glad to hear that.
"Evenin' sirs, welcome to SPACE hooters!"
The finest in tit related eatin' and drinkin' this side of the galaxy.
Can I start you boys off with somethin'?
Maybe a Tatooine Titty Twister or a Dagobah Dirt Bomb?
Just the bottle service.
Bottle service coming right up!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think it's just early.
What?
The guests are Jedi?
I know trouble when I sees it.
Believe you me these boys is covered in it.
We're screwed!
You know the Jedi reputation.
"Listen, we have to get them out of here."
Peacefully.
How are we going to do that?
"I mean, we can't just kick them out."
"Whatever you do, do not piss these guys off."
Is it normal to make us wait this long?
Relax!
I'd like to try their hot wings.
I'm actually hungry.
"You boys expectin' ladies, or is this just a sausage festival?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a sausage festival.
Say sausage one more time.
Sausage.
Let me guess.
The Jedi were perfect gentlemen... ...paid their bill in full... ...and left with no fuss.
No!
They skip out on their bill!
They steal from the cash register!
Are you all sure?
"I'll book it if you promise never to chant ""Bahamas"" again."
Okayt
"All right, thank you."
It's done
"Block of rooms, garden view."
"Wait a second, garden view?"
That's the opposite of ocean view
"Hey, foxy lady want to come back to my garden view room"
I asked for the garden
The nose from### the ocean keep me up at night
So what the noise from my foxy lady if I had an ocean view room
"Stacey, any chance the national's media picked up on this story with the media"
I gotta go.
"The mayor pulled an ""Uncle Louie"" last night."
Nothing national but did you see the headline in the post
His honor was on her.
Very clever
"Jason's### really killing us, sorry Mike"
Doesn't matter.
It's under control.
I got Jason coming over### here right now
Jason is coming up here?
Damn I hate this tie
Carter
Great tie
"Listen, Jason, about this story in the morning paper"
"I thought it was great, by the way"
You didn't think it was too wordy?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You're so talented...
Fellas
There isn't one penny at the bank
We could find the money here
What if we don't find anything?
"I dunno, but I'm sure we'll find something"
Hopefully
"What's all this, grandpa?"
To know just how much I still remember you
It's all mine?
All of it is yours
"And when you get bored of it, I'll buy you more toys"
We'll play together
And they won't play with us?
"No, they have another game they're playing, nevermind them"
Let's just play together random stuttering
Grandpa
What?
They're all asleep
"Good, I needed to tell you a secret"
What secret?
A very big secret but you can never tell anyone
No-one?
Yes
Ok I won't
"No you'll tell them, but I'll tell you when to tell them"
Okay
What's wrong dad?
Are you gonna kill us?!
Hunting season has begun!
Hunting?
Yes!
Have you forgotten how great of a hunter I was?
"Come on, we're going to fayoum to go hunt ducks"
This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language:
Divorce.
Divorce.
How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
"That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone."
"Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:"
Because what if God isn't real?
"I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?"
"And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:"
"And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave."
"Life is so freakin' short, you know?"
man:
"Dying, I guess."
[animal bells ringing]

The dogs are frightened of thunder. man speaking native language:
"Yeah, they're scared. man:"
"Vasya, we need to find some fireworks somewhere."
"Because in autumn, wolves will come. man:"
We need to hurry home.
It's going to rain!
all:
3...2...1... [cheering]
man:
Welcome to The Love Parade.
"Wow, it is gone."
What is this?
I missed the opportunity.
Is she that beautiful?
Who may be the blessed person that gave birth to.. ..such a beauty?!
She is from the abode of the gods.
Give me 2 liters.
Wait for 5 minutes.
We are in important discussion.
You came without knowing the name or address of the girl?
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?
What will you do here without those details?
That is the issue I am unable to solve.
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.
Why do you discourage him like that?
Encourage him.
Look here my dear Salim - My name is Venkat.
No.
If you are searching for your Anarkali then you are Salim.
You look so dynamic.
Why are you.. ..listening to this burnt out fellow?
Thats it.
"Look here, dont be depressed that you missed her."
Search!
- There is nothing you cannot find if you search.
"Who are you sir, giving advice freely?"
"Ranga Rao, a big name in the states."
I came here now.
I am planning to settle down in Warangal.
Thinking to settle in Warangal?
Bla bla bla
You see this?
It says 'Marital status':
'Never married' and the part I highlighted - I should have highlighted - the part next to it:
"'Surviving Spouse's Name, if wife give maiden name'"
'Surviving Spouse's Name' is blank
"Because in this country, gay couple's are not legally recognized."
Gay love is not recognized as love.
And we are therefore not treated as equal human beings to heterosexual human beings
Now look here.
I am on this though.
"Number, box 22a of the Florida Certificate of Death."
'Informant's Name':
Richard Bluestein.
That's me
And next to it in 22b:
'Relationship to decedent'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
'Friend'.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember"
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
You have neither fighting skill nor wisdom.
You don't even have courage to fight.
Just go and hide yourself like you normally do.
Granny!
Show me how to make a pouch.
- I'll make one for you.
- No.
I want to make it myself.
I want to embroider something on it too.
What will be good?
A flower?
A bird would be better.
I should be able to make it in two weeks?
- Did you arrange to meet him then?
- Yes.
I think it'll be the last time.
"If I make a pouch for him, will he cherish it?"
I suppose this is crossing the boundary too.
It's really been a while!
"Here, have another drink."
I really respect you!
I will accept that opinion!
I should have recognized you when you called me Doe Eyes the first time!
But you tricked me by saying Goggle Eyes instead!
"So you were fooled by that, right?"
I was a bit surprised at my quick wit too.
"Farewell, Doe Eyes!"
"Farewell, Goggle Eyes!"
It's similar!
You're really smart!
"At least you understand me, Doe Eyes!"
I really respect you!
Come let us pray for our father soul.
You made him a permanent servant by calling him brother.
"Gun, How much?"
- One liter.
"Only single, why dont you take two liters."
I dont have money.
What is the need for money between us?
"Hey, prepare the bill for one liter."
If you give 2 liters I will prepare the bill for 2 liters.
Shall I give you two slaps?.
What we want is ladies.
Then fill the tank.
Anyway it is not your money.
If I fill the tank she will not come until next week.
If I fill 2 liters she will be back tomorrow morning.
What happened madam?
You are not coming so frequently.
Did you forget me?
I remembered you the day before yesterday.
What about yesterday?
I didnt go to zoo yesterday.
Personal.
"Hey venki, Venkat is here."
All of you come here.
Venkat arrived.
"Hey, move of the way."
Always blocking the way.
Why are you shouting at her?
This is a routine matter for us.
- First tell me why are you here?
What about your interview?
- Its gone.
"I called the coiffure, the girls said you weren't there all day."
I can tell something happened.
Nothing happened Cemre.
I just got a bit emotional.
I can see that.
"But I am asking ""why""."
Well...
I don't know.
It thought about how small... ... how short life is.
It is like a blink of an eye.
"I mean, one can be so determined and work too much for something... ... and then one day it all goes away."
"I mean, as if it never existed."
As if it was a big lie.
"Cemre, life is full of lies."
Every life ends the same way... ... which makes everything meaningless.
Wish I knew what makes you say all this.
I was just thinking about all these stuff... ... they got me emotional.
But really Cemre... ... we have just one life.
"One must live for herself, not for others."
One must only regret what they couldn't do.
That's how it is.
My dear...
Don't regret anything.
"Forget about others, you fight for the one you love."
Be happy with whom you love.
"Yes, sweetie..."
You love Kuzey?
Go grab his hand.
You two suffered so much.
Cemre...
You deserve to be together.
My dear...
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
On the good ship lollipop.
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
Lemonade stands everywhere.
Crackerjack bands fill the air.
And there you are
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.
See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll
With the big bad devils food cake.
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
You'll awake with a tummy ache
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop

Oh... ( chuckling )
"Oh, my dear, lost love!"
I'm paralyzed with happiness.
"Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, nick carraway."
"Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no?"
I hope it means we do.
Tom says you've just come from chicago.
Tell me everything.
Do they miss me?
The whole town is desolate.
"Oh, how gorgeous."
All the cars have their left rear wheel
"Painted black as a mourning wreath,"
And there's a persistent wail all night.
"Let's go back tomorrow, tom."
I love a persistent wail.
"Well, I love a drink."
"Come on, let's all have a drink."
( sighs )
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
You live across the sound in west egg.
I know somebody there.
I don't know a single person.
You must know gatsby.
This place is quite big for a robot safari park.
"Ah, there's the border."
Hello!
A real elephant has come here.
What are you talking about?
But look...
-Then go over to that side.
"-Yes, sir!"
There is an invisible beam fence around this place.
Then where did this elephant come from?
It can never enter this place!
It must be a robot.
"No, this is a real..."
Leave.
I'm busy.
This is a real one for sure.
But it is true that it did come from somewhere.
"Hey, where did you come from?"
Hold on.
"Atom, Atom."
He's late.
Where did he go?
Doctor Ochanomizu.
Welcome to our safari park.
"Hey, Doctor Hura."
How is it?
Isn't this a wonderful park?
I feel reluctant to use animals for hunting even if they were robots.
You are still too serious.
Real animals are decreasing in its number recently.
So I developed animal robots that's the same as real ones so tourists can observe them and enjoy hunting.
That's why I opened this safari park in this vast field of Africa.
"No, I don't."
I don't know.
What are you saying?
I...
I can't remember.
I drank and blacked out.
"That is why I told you to be careful, didn't I?"
There are always eyes everywhere.
Who the heck did something like this?
"President, who brought these photos?"
I will immediately just!
There is no need for that.
I already took care of it.
Indeed!
"Still, we can't be relieved."
We don't know when other photos will circulate.
That can't happen.
All my female fans will disappear.
These photos are completely embarrassing.
"So, go abroad for awhile and take a rest."
It is easier to take care of it when you aren't around.
What about the schedules?
"Do you know the saying, ""penny-wise and pound-foolish?"""
We can't incur a great loss by pursuing a small profit.
Go!
Go Dong will be waiting for you downstairs.
Hyungnim!
Over here!
What is this?
It's this car again?
The President said to be careful so that we aren't seen by others.
"Get in, Hyung."
How dare you stare at my brother?!
For this criminal?
Criminal?!
"Not he, you all are criminals... ...who are stopping him from being a good person."
You are forcing him to be evil.
Go and make him good as you want.
Go away... go... get lost.
You are dead for us. you are dead.
"Yes, go away with him."
No one will stop you.
"Yes, I'll go away."
Right now.
"Let's go, Kishna."
"No, Radha."
I'll not take you away in this way.
Mother!
"Mother, if I wanted to elope with Radha I'd have done that 2 years before."
But now I'll take her away with respect and self-esteem.
Self-esteem!
Cultured people are self-esteemed... ...not some dirty blood.
Because I recognize dirty blood as goons.
Father!
"I'm sorry, I respected you."
You are not even worth for this respect.
Because my parents were poor... ...but they were very rich by hearts.
They knew to respect their guest even if he's their enemy.
"Kishan, I beg of you."
"Please, go away."
Go away!
- I'm going.
But he has blamed my blood by accusing my parents.
I'll never step in this house again.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
"My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?"
"My wife passed away, my children's mother."
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
"We have no electricity, no water, no drains."
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.

man:
"Until then, that name did not exist."
"And so, the name ""christian"" was made to name Jesus's disciples."
"Christian, in its true form, it is the disciple of Jesus."
Jesus's follower.
But Jesus wants followers?
He wants disciples?
Of course!
The last word before going to the heavens was:
"""Therefore, go and make disciples."""
The last thing He said!
"Normally, the last words of a man is the most important thing, the legacy he will leave."
Jesus said:
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
He begins with this.
Matthew 28.18.
"""I have been given all authority"""
"""in heaven and on earth."""
"""Therefore, go and make disciples"""
"Of where? ""of all the nations."""
From all places.
"""I want disciples, in all places,"""
"""of all nations."""
How to make disciples?
He answers:
"""Baptizing them in the name of the Father,"""
"""the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"""
"""and teaching them"" what?"
"""To obey everything I have commanded you."""
"""And surely I am with you always,"""
"""to the very end of the age."""
"So, in this job, I will help you."
You can fix my word here too.

She's in stage four.
"Legally, they quarantine you at stage five."
"The doctor said she shouldn't be using public restrooms, eating with others, or in the proximity of the disabled."
(TWEET!)
They have it wrong.
Maybe she has partial brain damage?
A unique strain of Tourettes?
There is no way Mom is an Obnoxious Bitch.
"Wake up, Jenna!"
We have to face this now.
There's gotta be something they can do.
What are the options?
Can -- Can she get surgery?
The doctor said there's not a surgeon in the country that would take that risk.
The procedure would kill her?
"No, the surgeon would."
Doctors say she's the most Obnoxious Bitch they've ever seen.
Is she going to die?
Not soon enough.
Those two are my daughters right there.
The one on the right I almost aborted.
"The one on the left has got G-d-knows-what swimmin"" in there."
I -- I need to call Steve.
"Oh, no!"
You cannot call Steve.
Why?
It runs in families.
They say it skips a generation.
You could be carrying an Obnoxious Bitch right now.
Oh!
Whoa!
"Sarcasm, that's original!"
"""Where are the gold bars you were supposed to pull out of that bank vault with your transmatter ray?"""

"Well, no, they're not gonna say anything in the press but..."

The molecules tend to shift during the...
Transmatter.... uh... events.
But they were transported in bar form.
And they clearly were...
"And by the way it's not about making money, it's about taking money."

So transmatter is 75%.

Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"- Yes, sir."
We've been informed that you'll defend your own case.
Yes..
"I don't have any other option, Your Honour."
The other lawyers are scared.
"So, I'll have to defend this case.."
"My lordship, this is a baseless appeal."
A publicity stunt.
There's no cause of action that can be proved in court.
"So I suggest, under order 7 rule no.11.. ..of the code of civil procedure."
This case be straightaway dismissed.. ..for out of cause action.
"Your Honour, my English isn't that good.. ..but I do understand that he's asking.. ..to shut down this case immediately."
Right?
You're right.
I don't want to get into this hassle in the first place.
"I'm a Gujarati, businessman."

That's right.
"Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,"
I need to make sure that they are all working properly.
"Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?"
How about a two-digit number?
Audience:
22.
AB:
22.
"And another two-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
47.
AB:
"Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working."
"Do all of you get 1,034?"
"1,034?"
Volunteer:
No.
AB:
594.
Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
(Applause)
"Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?"
"OK, great."
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
That's OK.
I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
"There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself."
"For instance, five squared would be?"

"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Do you not like the color?
"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Do you not like the shape?
"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler."
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

I really can't.
They nearly lynched me today in the town.
I bet it's the pig called Reşat who let those men on us.
I bet.
Do everything to prevent this news to reach the national newspapers.
People might believe it.

But you should pressure them as well.

I pity this country if people like them can freely write their fabricated lies.

My source is reliable.
Who is your source?
Tell us so we know.
You will have to spill it out in court anyway.
I'm lose my mind...
There's the sworn statement of the girl.
And there's the gendarme reports.
Easy now...
Save yourself to the prosecutor.
You can't fabricate news like that.
You'll publish a refutation.

"Yes, yes."
"Or, you know, just, state what they are."
"Yeah, yeah, good."
"So, I guess, You, you know, I guess just avoid making your paper seem like a, a thesis."
Yeah I've encountered that as well.
I'm reviewing papers.
Yeah.
Where you can tell that a.
Somebody had taken the thesis.
Yeah.
And just tried to turn it into a paper.
It's a very different product.
Right.
"So paying attention to the, the actually writing like a paper."
Right.
He says it's a great tip.
Mm-hm.
And lets talk a little bit about resubmission.
So lets say that you're offered the opportunity.
"The, the paper's rejected but."
Mm-hm.
You're offered the opportunity to resubmit it with a lot of comments from reviewers.
Mm-hm.
"- No, Your Honor."
- Very well.
"Excuse me, Your Honor... ...but the jury would like to make a recommendation... ...regarding the sentence."
- Objection.
"Sit down, counselor."
"It's only a recommendation, and I would like to hear it."
We recommend a sentence of time served.
I'll accept that.
"You are guilty, Father Moore."
And you are free to go.
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.
Thank you.
"Well, you shocked us all."
Everyone at the firm sees this as another victory.
The archdiocese is pleased.
They feel the trial has raised public interest in the Church.
Have you seen the news?
"There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man... ...right next to you."
Just like James Van Hopper.
"All right, I'll say it."
I was wrong.
But I'm ready to make it right.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Will you be able to return to your parish?
I can't go back.
Not now.
Once you've looked into the darkness... ...I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
What about you?
I believe you've seen the darkness too.
I don't know.
That's what we've got to do.
"Now, some of you aren't in the optimal position to hit the"
lattice.
I invite you to come down and get a little closer.
That is okay.
"Now, are you roughly ready?"
Yeah.
All right.
But there is one other piece of information that is very important that I have got to tell you.
And that is that only fools aim for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER]
"Okay, go to it."
Watch your ball.
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles been launched?
Yes.
Fantastic.
All right.
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha particle that backscattered?
"Okay, so now I've got to count."
Keep your hands up because there are some lights that make it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?
Yes.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Six.
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?
That's it?
Six alpha particles that backscattered.
"Okay, so now we have to calculate some probabilities here."
The probability of backscattering is the number that backscattered.
Chandra:
"So, do they ask you then?"
I'll make it clear.
It's before we start dating.
They'll know that I'm an asexual person.
"And I'll make it clear when we're, you know, when we're still in the friend stage."
Elisabeth:
Do they see it as a challenge?
"Do they think, ""Well, I'm gonna get him to be sexual."" ?"
[laughter]
David:
"A couple people have, but it hasn't worked out."
Star:
"So, do you not have sex?"
"I mean, do asexual people not have sex at all?"
No sexual contact?
David:
"There's a couple of aexual people who, kind of as a compromise because they're in a relationship with sexual people."
It's not like a code.
It's not like we kick you out or something.
Joy:
"Well, let me ask you something."
[laughter]
Do you ever have sex with yourself?
[laughter]
David:
It's a valid question.
[laughter]
"Perfectly, perfectly, valid question."
[applause]
Joy:
You may not be attracted to anyone else but that doesn't mean you're not attracted to yourself.
It works fairly well for typical cases.
And then we've got the Knuth-Morris-Prath
Method that can guarantee linear time and has no backup.
And maybe uses extra space unless you use Pratt's version.
The Aboriamor who can get the running time down to n/m which is quite an amazing jump and quite useful and in a Rabin Karp that's very flexible and extends through all these other situations.
"This is a nice mac, microcosm of algorithmic technology where, really interesting, and unique and path breaking algorithmic ideas give us."

Majestic:
Hello Ashley
Ashley:
Hi
Majestic:
You're looking very sexy tonight
Ashley:
"Oh, I just put on my, lingerie."
Majestic:
Dance for me baby
Ashley:
Oh well if you insist
Majestic:
(laughs)
Ashley:
"Wait, I just want to sink into it."
Majestic:
"Oh yeah, ohh yeah"
Ashley:
This is how I ground myself in my sexuality (laughter)
Majestic:
I like it when you get your hands going.
Oh there they go!
I will come with you to Rome
But I want something in return
"Anything, I can be very generous"
Let my son rule Egypt
"Not for the moment, no"
Then let me give Antony an Egyptian burial
"Here, in this place"
"Then I will come to you as the Queen of Egypt, bowing to the might of Rome"
Very well
I'll need time to prepare
And the emblems of my office?
"Of course, you can have them I have no use for them"
I have what I want
Make sure she doesn't harm herself
"Wait for me, Antony"
I won't be long
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
"Why weren't you here to protect me, Rufio?"
"I regret that it was not possible, Your Majesty"
We need to be alone to pray
Away from Roman eyes
I'm afraid I can't allow that
You should know our ways by now
Don't you trust me?
I've trusted you all these years
Where is our Queen?
What have you done with her?
We want our Queen!
We want our Queen!
"Open the doors, Your Majesty!"
Open them now... or I'll have to break them down!
David:
"Over 6,000."
Elisabeth:
"Over 6,000?"
"So, there are plenty of people, um, experiencing this as well, like you do"
"So, can you just explain for everybody exactly what being an asexual actually means and how it is to live that way?"
David:
An asexual person is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.
David:
"So, the way that, you know, most sexual people walking down the street and you see someone or you're in a relationship with someone at some point, you feel like introducing sexuality into that."
That just never happens to asexual people.
Joy:
And is it a problem?
David:
"No, it's not a problem."
Joy:
"So, then, why do you need to organize?"
[laughter]
David:
There's a lot of things that are not a problem that you can organize around.
"We need to organize, well, partially, because it's not getting talked about."
"Because, um-"
Star:
"If you're not talking about sex, what's there to talk about?"
[laughter]
Joy:
Thank you!
[laughter]
Star:
"I mean, I don't understand."

There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
A man who no longer believes in himself?
Stand up!
Stand up and fight!
Be a man!
You want me to be a man?
"Yes...Antony, look at me!"
Look at me!
We'll fight!
"You may tell your Queen, Rufio, that I've received her tokens of submission and am most grateful"
As to the request to spare her son
I can not answer that for the moment
Why are you still loyal to her?
Has she enchanted you as well?
I'm under orders from Caesar...
Caesar is dead!
I am Caesar now
You could be my ears in Alexandria
"Very well, then"
"Tell her that, before I can accept her offer,"
I would require some gesture of sincerity...
tell her to deliver to me... the head of Marc Antony
You may go...
Provide Octavius with what he requires and you'll find him most grateful
No
You must
"Your Majesty, in the name of lsis, please, do not forsake your country, your own child"
Not for love
It would be like stabbing my own heart
Better Antony than Egypt
Better that than your own son's life!
Take the knife
I want to share something with you
[Bleep].
I got it.
I've got it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Helene)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Fire.
[Bleep]. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We've got a fire.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

Just stand back.

Like a knight in shining armor.
- Everything's fine.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Brilliant. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Very brave.
Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Okay.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You set the place on fire.
"- No, it's not funny."
"- You're right, you're right."
"Trust me, you've got your neck in a noose."
Be careful. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's crazy.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

Whoo!
[Applause]
Well done.
"(Announcer) After observing and tasting throughout the challenge, the judges now take one final look to identify three standout dishes."
That giving mukti.
"Up to namabhas, up to mukti, it may be."
Or may not.
That name.
[or??] namakar.
That [of??] the seed without the potency within it.
Imitation is like that.
Without the seed.
"The medicine is there, apparently."
But the potency of the medicine is [absent?].
It will be like that.
At most that name produce what is namabhasa.
One thing: proper...
Name proper.
Name means it is not material.
It is not under the jurisdiction of the concocted area.
Misunderstood area.
It must not have root there.
In the [paws?] of imitation.
The root must not be there.
"The root, name proper, must have to become, have it's connection with the infinite proper."
One thing.
"And the next thing: it must be treated properly, that is sevon-mukh, serving attitude."
"Not exploiting mood, not indifferent mood."
"Serving attitude must be there and the seed must be proper seed, bonafide."
Two things necessary.
Everywhere.
"Sadhu-sanga, that is also bonafide."
We are to differentiate it from the sham.
From the apparent.
That is from mayic conception.
Which is not so.
[laughter]
Joy:
"Because if you were having sex with yourself, one more question: that would mean that you have sexual feelings."
See?
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
David:
"Well, the thing is...okay."
"The important thing is, at least as far as thinking about my life-"
"If you are going to have a sexual relationship with someone,"
Joy:
Yeah.
David:
That's a lot of energy you have to spend into thinking about that
like thinking about that relationship.
Joy:
"So, what are you just lazt or what?"
[laughter]
David:
"Well, I still form relationships."
Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everyone else.
"So, I still have to think about forming relationships."
I just don't have to think about forming relationships sexually.
I have to think about how am I going to start a relationship without something else?
How am I going to form intimacy in a way that isn't based on sexuality?
Star:
Help me with this.
Because what you seem to be describing is more of a choice.
Than an orientation.
"Intially, I thought you were describing an orientation."
David:
"No, I am describing an orientation."
Star:
"""And I learned this:"""

Hit on the head with an iron rod.
"After the incident, he lost his memory."
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.
He remembers events for only about 15 minutes.
Afterwards... he forgets everything.
"For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it."
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.
"Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings..."
lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind.
How does he go about his everyday routine?
How does a child perform instructed tasks?
"By committing to memory, learning by rote."
"Or, by jotting things down in writing."
"Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing."
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?

This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."

Highly abundant number
"Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number ""n"" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true."
formula_1
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
Example.
"An example would be to use the number 5. ""σ"" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every ""σ"" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number."
History.
"Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than ""N"" is proportional to log2 ""N""."
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
"The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,"
"but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,"
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
"Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969."
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

Though interbreeding can happen between each of the 19 populations around the horseshoe, the ""Ensatina eschscholtzii"" subspecies on the western end of the horseshoe cannot interbreed with the ""Ensatina klauberi"" on the eastern end. It is an illustration of ""nearly all stages in a speciation process"" (Dobzhansky). Richard Highton argued that ""Ensatina"" is a case of multiple species and not a continuum of one species."

Luritja
"Luritja is the name of an Australian Aboriginal group of the Western Desert. They speak the Luritja dialect of Wati, the language of the Western Desert people. The dialect itself has several varieties. The Luritja lands include areas to the west and south of Alice Springs. The region is centred on Kings Canyon. Their neighbours are the Arrernte (east), the Warlpiri (north), the Pintupi (west), and the Pitjantjatjara (south)."
"In recent decades, many from this group have inter-married with Pintupi-speaking people. During the mid 20th-century, the Pintupi were forced to leave their lands and were settled into government-built stations. Papunya became a settlement for both Pintupi and Luritja. In the 1980s, many of these people moved back west to Kintore. Both communities now mainly speak a hybridised dialect known as Pintupi-Luritja."
"The name ""luritja"" is thought to come from the Arrernte word ""lurinya"", which means ""foreigner"". Over time younger generations have taken on the name as their ethnonym. The total population of Luritja people (including those at Papunya) is probably in the thousands. This makes them the third largest of the Central Australian Aboriginal populations, behind the Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara."

In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated. As the protocol does not require these frames to be encrypted, an attacker can simply send such a command to deconnect a device. The attacker only needs to know the MAC address of the victim. This address is sent unencrypted with each frame."

Fixed-gear bicycle
"A fixed-gear bicycle (also called a ""fixie"") is a bicycle that has no freewheel mechanism (allowing pedals to stay still while moving)."
It is a dangerous bike to use in towns. This type of bicycle is becoming more and more popular around the world.
"Fixed-gear bicycles are very light. They are built without any unnecessary gadgets, such as chain rings or freewheel hub. When a person rides a fixed-gear bicycle, he/she/they need not put a lot of energy into it as with a geared bike."
"Most bicycles have a freewheel so the pedals will stay stationary while the bicycle is moving and so that the rider can ride without pedaling going forward or down a hill. Fixed-gear bicycles have even simpler mechanisms with pedals fixed to the back wheel. That means that the rider cannot stop pedaling. When the rear wheel turns, the pedals turn in the same direction. This allows a cyclist to use a brake by putting a pressure in opposite directions to pedals, so that the mechanism will not rotate."
"It also makes it possible to ride backwards, although learning to do so is much more difficult than riding forwards."

Siegbert Tarrasch
"Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a German doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day."
"Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism."
"Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;p411"
"Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine."
Chess author.
"Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His ""Dreihundert Schachpartien"" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the ""praeceptor mundi"", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine ""One of the monuments of our game"".f/w"
"Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the ""Deutsch Schachzeitung"", the German-language chess magazine. These annotations were read throughout the world, since that was the leading chess magazine of the day."

"The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a core member of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols used for the Internet. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, known as ""datagrams"", to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in ."
Ports.
"UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response."
"Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named ""well-known"" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access."
"Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports."
"Ports 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers."
Uses.
"There are many uses for UDP, for example BitTorrent optionally uses it for peer-to-peer file sharing. The Teredo tunneling protocol uses UDP."

Fraud
"Fraud (or defrauding or scamming) is a crime in which someone tricks somebody else to get unfair or unlawful gain. Frauds are almost always about money, either directly or indirectly."
"A ""fraudster"" or a ""fraud"" is the person who commits the fraud. ""Fraudulence"" is the adjective, as in ""He tried to pass a fraudulent cheque."" To ""defraud"" someone is to commit a fraud against them."
"Fraudsters may find people to defraud by phone calls, emails, or websites. Fraud often starts by saying there is a free or low price item. The fraudster then asks for personal information, such as a home address and bank account numbers. Instead of giving an item, the fraudster takes their money. Fraudsters often target senior citizens."
Fraud is a criminal wrong: a fraudster may be prosecuted and imprisoned. It is also a civil wrong: a fraud victim may sue the fraudster to get compensation.
"All societies have laws against fraud, but the details differ in each jurisdiction. In England an Act of Parliament defines three kinds of fraud."

He studied trypanosomiasis and other protozoal diseases. He produced trypan red, which was (as his Japanese assistant Shiga showed) effective against trypanosomes."
"He invented a staining system for bacteria (before Gram staining). He did a complete survey of all the cell staining techniques then known. He showed how to tell the difference between different kinds of white blood cells, and discovered mast cells. He discovered that methylene blue, which stains bacteria and cell nuclei, could put the malarial parasite, ""Plasmodium"", into recession (the fever drops)."
"He also made a decisive contribution to an antiserum against diphtheria, and developed a method for standardizing therapeutic serums. His co-worker got a sole Nobel Prize for the joint work on diphtheria."

Usually, the function XOR is used to link two consecutive values. Commonly, the function XOR is used on a bit-level. With n bits, it is possible to represent 2n numbers, so after 2n-1 values the sequence will repat. In computing, linear-feedback shift registers are commonly used to compute pseudorandom numbers."

"Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases."
"And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes."

Phenol
"Phenol is the organic compound with formula C6H5OH. It is a white solid. It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol. Because the aromatic group attracts electrons, it is quite acidic. topolin is produced from petroleum. It is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products. It is also used in detergents and herbicides."
Properties.
Acidity.
"Phenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion."
Reactions.
"Phenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well. This is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile. Because the lone pair is so high in energy however, sometimes phenol reacts too many times."
History.
"Phenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis. They used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people."

"The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-cho period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to ""Echizen no kuni"" (present Echizen city) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen city became an area famous for their production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen city became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets."
Two main processes.
"The two main important processes: ""nimai hiroge"" and ""mawashi hagane tsuke""."
...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a machine hammer.
...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond.

The koala, common ringtail possum and ""Platypus"" have been introduced and still survive there. Kangaroo Island had a native species of emu, the Kangaroo Island emu which became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836. Perhaps this was caused by bushfires or hunting by sealers or whalers."

Scuttled by PBS.
"The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision ""robbed a national public television audience"" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power."
Critics.
"B.J. Bullert, in his book ""Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film"" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying ""It's more difficult to say (""Dark Circle"") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism""."
Point of view.
"The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."

Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine:
Communication.
There are basically two ways of communication:
From the machine to the Simatic.
"In the machine, there are sensors. A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine. For example, how fast the motor rotates, what the temperature is or when the current action is completed. All this information is necessary for the program. The sensors give out an electrical signal, each signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit. So the program knows what´s going on in the machine. This is very important, because now the program can perform the next correct step in its sequence. For example, if the temperature of the motor is too high, the program has to know it. Now the program will switch off the motor."
From the Simatic to the machine.
"In the machine, there are actuators. They cause a wanted motion, action or forming. Examples for actuators are a motor, a heater or a light. If the program says that it´s time to switch on the light in the machine, the right output of the Simatic unit will be set. That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light."
The name Simatic.
"The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens, since 1958. Simatic connects “Siemens” and “Automatic” in one word."
Product lines.
Siemens developed four different product lines so far:
Used Software.
Every automation system needs a program to control a machine. To create a program you need a software. Siemens created their own software for their products.

Lect
A lect is a specific form of language.
Some examples of lects:
Register (linguistics)
"A register, in linguistics, is the way people use different words, spelling or grammar—talk or write differently—to different people, in different situations. They might be more polite to strangers, for example. Or they will be more respectful to their boss at work."
This chart shows the words or phrases that one would use depending on different registers:
Stratum (linguistics)
"In linguistics, a stratum, or strate, is a language that changes another language or is changed by another language."
"A substratum is the language which is changed, and a superstratum is the language that changes it. An adstratum is two languages changing each other at the same time."
Language transfer
"Language transfer is where a person uses their knowledge of one language when they learn another one. This can help them, but it can also confuse them."

Hematopoiesis
"Hematopoiesis (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cells. In a healthy adult person, about 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. The process is called hematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=""Birbrair n/a–n/a""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the core (bone marrow) of most bones."
As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type.
HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.

Embroidery
"Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials with designs stitched in strands of thread or yarn using a needle. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. Sewing machines can be used to create machine embroidery."
Qualifications.
"City and Guilds qualification in Embroidery allows embroiderers to become recognized for their skill. This qualification also gives them the credibility to teach. For example, the notable textiles artist, Kathleen Laurel Sage, began her teaching career by getting the City and Guilds Embroidery 1 and 2 qualifications. She has now gone on to write a book on the subject."

Eccentricity
Eccentricity or extravagance is a word used to describe unusual behaviour in a person. People who have habits which many people think are very strange may be called eccentric. Eccentric behaviour is not necessarily good or bad in itself.
Some clever people (geniuses) have behaviour which might be described as eccentric. It is not always clear whether behaviour is just eccentric or whether it is madness.
"Famous people who were eccentric in their different ways include Albert Einstein, Nero, Alan Turing, Howard Hughes, Ludwig II of Bavaria and Lord Berners."

Conversation
"A conversation is two or more people talking about something. It is spontaneous, usually unplanned, though the people may have interests in common."
"Conversations are one of the basic types of human communication. They can be about any subject, and do not necessarily have any fixed purpose. They allow people with different views of a topic to learn from each other. A conversation may be contrasted with formal presentations. A talk or speech, for example is an oral presentation by one person directed at a group. It is basically a one-way communication."
"Conversations do not have to happen in person, they can happen over the telephone or on the Internet."
Banter.
"Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults. It can contain misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is each line of banter should ""top"" the one before it. It is a verbal war of wit without any physical contact."

SR Class 2Wim
"2Wim was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a small fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class."
SR Class 4DD
"Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."
Network SouthEast

Discourses on Livy
"The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli."
It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured.
"While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a ""kingly state"" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a ""civil way of life"". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as ""princes"". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism."
Product rule
"In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication."
formula_1
formula_2.
Steps.
Say we have the function formula_3.
The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.
We can set
formula_6 and
formula_7.
The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.
"We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14."
"To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18."
"Now we can substitute the values into the equation,"
formula_19.
Proof.
One definition of a derivative is
"formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21."
formula_24
We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.
formula_25
"The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,"
"formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32."

Brazing
Brazing is a metal-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
Brazing differs from welding because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering.
"During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action."
"The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength."

The Flory convention.
"In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates."

Simple Network Management Protocol
"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite. SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects."
"SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc."
Overview and basic concepts.
"In common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an ""agent"" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems."
"SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as ""free memory"", ""system name"", ""number of running processes"", ""default route""). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration."
"The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."

He won the Calder Cup in 1998 while he was apart of the Boston Bruins farm team, the Providence Bruins."
Halteres
"Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better."
"The halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings."
Function.
"Halteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight."
"They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight."
"Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres."
"The two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres."
Development.
"In Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene ""Ultrabithorax"" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype."
Convergent evolution.
"The Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the ""forewings"" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the ""hindwings"" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution."
"Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and ""in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight""."
A manicure is the act of beautifying one's hands or fingernails. Manicures can be done at home or by a professional in a nail salon.
"During a manicure, the nail is filed with a nail file; the free edge of the nail is cut, the cuticle is treated, the person's hand is massaged and nail polish is put on."
History.
"5000 years ago, manicures were first used. Henna was used in India for manicure. The word mehendi, another word for henna, derives from the Sanskrit mehandika. Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, had very long naturally-grown nails."
Dietitian
A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.
"Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers."
In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.
"The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians."
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
"Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers."
"Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well."
Mycology
"Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and psychoactive substances."
A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist.
"Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi."
"Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants."
"Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle."

"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
and have a happy Thanksgiving.
"Thank you,"
you too.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
"The way,"
I'll go ahead and start
"the way I work, uh, the way I dress for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and tie,"
Uh-huh.
"or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day."
Uh-huh.
"A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day."
"I mean, pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, it was very different before."
How do you dress?
"Well, I'm a drafter,"
so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes
and I have sweatshirt on today.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much the norm for me.
"If I come in in a dress, everybody's shocked"
"Yeah,"
I understand.
"They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress"
and it's usually I haven't done my laundry lately
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I've, I've seen it, uh,"
"and, and I have no problem going out in a boat, uh,"
"it's just so dreadfully expensive,"
and there's just so many other ways live down there.
Yeah.
It's not a treat
Uh-huh.
it's what you do every day.
That's right.
You know.
That's right.
"Uh, one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them you know, out on the, on the beach and you know, just, uh, pitching them out, on, uh, on, uh, what am I trying to say, newspaper and, and, breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them, and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Uh-huh.
"and, and that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh, but, the other little creatures would take care of what was left."
"That's right,"
"So, going out on a boat, never did appeal to me simply because it, you know, there was so much else to do."
that's right.
Right.
Right.
"Well, do you live like along, uh, Houston, down there?"
"No,"
no.
I live in Dallas.
I lived in Dallas.
"oh, okay."
"But you, uh,"
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
"well two, two of them actually."
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
Oh that was great one.
"Wasn't that fabulous,"
"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
"Oh, I loved it."
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
and I need to go see it.
"Oh, you need to see that."
Yeah.
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
Uh-huh.
and this all took place in the South.
Oh my.
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
"You bet, especially in the South."
"Yes,"
"right,"
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
The acting was phenomenal.
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
"Yeah,"
yeah
"And these days that helps, doesn't it?"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
I know what you mean.
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.
"Um, I do that a lot."
Uh-huh.
I do spaghetti a lot.
"Yeah,"
it seems like most people like spaghetti.
"Yeah,"
I don't like to do that if it's real hot though.
Yeah.
"Because, um, I don't know,"
"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
I guess.
"Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I think that's right.
"And, um, we don't entertain that often,"
"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Most,"
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often.
I mean
You know
"But it is nice,"
"it is a, it is really a nice area."
"I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,"
and we could not get her out of the what she called the English back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.
"Oh, really?"
Oh.
And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
"Oh, good heavens"
Not me
I avoid the sun
"Well, yeah,"
"basically I do, too."
"Yeah,"
"it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass."
And I try to cover up when I do the lawn
"Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly."
"Yeah,"
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems"
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"
oh no.
"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."
Where do you get most of your news?
"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
"Oh, yeah."
They get burnt off.
"They, they really do,"
Uh-huh.
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, and that makes it bad too, because, uh, when more, with water being at a premium."
"I know our aunt in California,"
"they, they have really been rationed on their water."
"And it makes it real hard to have a yard or, uh, or anything like that, a their garden, their farms."
"Their farmers, I guess, are hurting because of that also."
Yeah.
"Well, my parents are now in San Diego,"
"and, and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't, almost nobody there has, has lawns."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well, they are not allowed to water,"
so what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, it is very, it is very rough on them"
"so,"
Uh-huh.
"Actually I think, I think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas."
"Because the, the Summers are extremely hot."
Uh-huh.
"But your humidity is different though than ours I think,"
"and it makes a, a bit of a difference, too."
"Um, what is your humidity like?"
"Oh, I don't know."
I think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas.
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.
"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"
you dump the chicken
"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
It probably comes from where you are.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that it probably does.
Most
"I, I'm not sure"
"but,"
"When I drive through that area, that's all I see is  pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards."
Yeah.
"It's nothing but woods up here, down here."
Yeah.
"I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't,"
"I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually."
"And, but that was just when I was a kid"
so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.
"But it's, I don't know, we're a college town"
so that doesn't help us out any.
Right.
East Texas.
"We have,"
"gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon,"
so that's probably about what you're paying
Huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that"
so.
Yeah.
That's a lot easier.
You've got something going all the time.
"Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?"
"Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,"
"And, uh, until next time."
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
"Uh, no"
"I think that maybe the, the automation people that are very discrete. Or not discrete, electronic devices."
"Oh, okay."
Oh.
"So, and, did he, is he the one that got you connected with us?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
It's a lot of fun.
Yeah.
You want to punch the button and go?
"Sure,"
you ready?
Yip
Okay.
"Well, are you going to buy a car soon?"
"Well, it won't be too much longer because my husband and I are both going to retire."
"And when we retire we're going to buy us, a, you know, a new one and, and get rid of the two that we have right now."
And what are you going to buy?
"I I don't know,"
"we're either going to buy a pick up,"
or we're going to buy a van.
"Or we're going to buy an economy car,"
how do you like that
"Well, have you been listening to Iacocca's arguments that, uh, that Chrysler products are the only ones that, that all have air bags?"
"Uh, yeah."
Does that make a difference to you?
Yeah.
It sure does.
I like to watch those skins games.
Uh-huh.
"Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know,"
for each hole they win they get the money for it.
Uh-huh.
I think those are pretty exciting.
"Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf."
"You hit a little ball,"
"you chase it,"
"you go find it,"
and then you hit it again and lose it again.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,"
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.
Oh really
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.
"Oh, I know."
"Oh, yeah."
My husband and his buddies are not very good.
They play like maybe once a month or less
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and so they all hit like in the low nineties,"
and they think they're having a really good game
"Oh, yeah."
So.
"Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies"
Wow.
so he wasn't bad.
"Yeah,"
that is good.
"no,"
"I watch those if I,"
"but my husband likes to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which I'm not,"
"Oh, see, I like sports."
"No,"
I don't.
"Well, I, I do, I like ice skating"
"and I like, uh, gymnastics, and some track and field,"
Uh-huh.
"but I, I,"
and I'll watch snippets of baseball games
"and I, I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing."
Uh-huh.
"And I don't ever, no matter what's on, I don't ever just sit and watch T V."
"I'm usually either doing dishes,"
"or I may be sewing,"
"or, you know, I always have, or letter writing,"
I know.
"or I may be working around in the room somehow,"
"but I don't, I don't ever just sit and,"
"I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know."
"No,"
I don't sit.
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
I know.
Who has time?
"I don't have time to sit, I know."
No.
"It's, it's, uh,"
That's why I don't get to watch that much.
"I mean, I, watch nine o'clock"
Right.
"It's just,"
Yeah.
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,"
"the opposition will say this, this and this and"
Uh-huh.
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is,"
Yep
it's pretty amazing.
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore."
"It's,"
"Yeah,"
it's not.
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because."
Yep.
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious"
and he really gets into suing people.
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv"
"but,"
"But, uh,"
Yeah
"but it's for the more general,"
people don't want to take responsibility.
Yeah.
"You know, it's,"
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh  and stuff."
Yep
"See, you're from California,"
is that right?
"Uh, yeah."
Well originally from Chicago
"but,"
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
"well, we, we've had, uh,"
"let's see,"
"we had, uh, we had a, uh,"
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
"and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story"
"Uh, and we had a sixty-five"
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
"So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really."
"Yeah,"
we've been real pleased with ours.
"I think we've had, one, two, three"
Yeah.
"and most,"
"we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven."
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"but I don't know,"
"we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year"
"and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, I don't know what we're going to buy."
"I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,"
"but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty"
Well
"So,"
more because of their personalities than their sportsman
Uh-huh.
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
"so you know, the competitor,"
and I became involved in following his career.
Right
"And, uh, I know that, that my husband,"
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.
Oh.
And he thought he was spectacular.
"I said, Whoa."
"I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him."
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition
Uh-huh.
"Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,"
and I followed Andy Bean.
Uh-huh
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
"Oh, he's interesting."
He is.
I like to watch him.
"He is a character not just a golfer,"
Yeah.
but he's quite a character.
Yeah.
"And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model in any field, any sports."
Yeah.
"and, uh, course this,"
"grant it,"
"that's, you know, it's been four years ago,"
"but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh,"
"my boss just bought a, a pick up truck,"
"and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon."
Yeah.
"But it, it has a big engine,"
"and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff,"
"but it's, and it, it's got the seats"
"that, and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, uh, rear air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates."
Yeah.
"Well, now, this one that we went in,"
it did
to baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?
Ford.
A what?
Ford.
A Ford?
"Ford what,"
you remember?
"conversation with He was trying to think of what the name of it was,"
"Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all, real nice,"
this was a big one.
"I mean it was a big one,"
"yeah,"
oh those are
"it has the front and the back and you know, it has the uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed"
yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
"What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job."
Uh-huh.
I'm a nurse
"and I work,"
Oh
I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
"and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that."
"To, to compensate for some of the benefits."
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
Yes.
And then I have my freedom.
I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
"Well, that, that's an excellent,"
"so actually that is a benefit, uh,"
"Well, it is to me."
"Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,"
Yeah.
and I'm just really not interested in all that.
Right.
"Right,"
"well I guess that's a good point, uh,"
"I really haven't,"
"no,"
huh-uh
I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
"It was brand new, white,"
it was like a big marshmallow.
"When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you."
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
"and I mean, they did whatever"
"and, and we went for a test drive in that"
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
"And I wanted it,"
but I had a choice of that or my house
"and I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house"
so.
"Yeah,"
"there, there's something about having a place to live,"
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"you know, it's just necessary."
"And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical."
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
"Yeah,"
right
"So,"
"I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars."
"They are, they're pretty aren't they lately"
Yeah.
"And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive."
They really are.
"and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,"
so.
"Oh, yeah."
What part of California are you from?
"San Jose, California."
"Oh, really?"
I have a good friend there.
"Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs."
Yeah .
"A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole,"
we've only been here a couple of years.
"Uh, before that we lived in Colorado"
"but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable."
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense,"
"I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's
You know.
"And it, it's that kind of thing"
"and, uh,"
"That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,"
Yeah.
"We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort."
Sure.
Do you have that where you live
"or,"
"Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,"
I'm an intern
and then I go  back down in May.
"It's almost, you know, identical kind of country."
Uh-huh.
Beautiful.
Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,"
so.
Um.
"Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it ."
"Yeah,"
"that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early."
Is that right?
Well.
If it would came later it would be all right?
"Uh, it, there's some trees"
"like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy."
"There's,"
nothing bothers them.
"Their leaves are still green,"
and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves.
"Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit,"
but they still look pretty good.
Um.
"It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree."
Okay.
"Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football"
Oh well
Do you follow football very much?
"I'm sorry, what?"
Do you follow football very much?
"Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh,"
"here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up."
You're kidding.
Nope.
"They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company."
God.
"Well, if you,"
"I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,"
"but, uh,"
Not at all.
"especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated."
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes
sir.
Huh.
"I spent, uh, couple of years down there."
Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.
"Are, where you from originally."
"Uh, right here in Maryland."
"Huh,"
so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
"Yeah,"
"and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know."
Huh.
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either."
Not at all.
"I'm not real sure what the,"
What do you think about capital punishment?
"Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes."
Yeah.
Which crimes do you feel that?
"Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it."
Yeah.
"Because of,"
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
Right.
"selling, I think should also."
Exactly.
Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
Yeah
"I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the state that has, uh, the death penalty."
I come from Florida.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it."
"They tend to, like, fry people left and right.  which,"
Yeah
"that's,"
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Texas is too.
"Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years."
Yeah.
"So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess."
"They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville."
"My husband is a counselor,"
"and he works, mostly with adolescents."
"Oh, you know a lot about that."
"So yeah,"
I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
Uh-huh.
"But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,"
and then they start a drug problem.
Yeah.
"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
"I know,"
I'm glad of that.
"And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters on so far,"
"that's my conference call,"
I have one daughter still at home.
One's at U T
"and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night."
"Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that,"
"No,"
"no,"
"I don't care about that,"
she'll be on the phone all night.
"Yeah,"
"it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather."
Right.
Do you have children?
No
"not yet,"
"we're expecting a baby in July,"
"Oh, great,"
so we're starting.
Yes.
"And then,"
You save a lot.
Right.
"If, if, if, if,"
"and you need to be very careful,"
"if the loan is set up to have bi, they call it a yuppie loan, if it's set up for bimonthly payments."
Right.
"If you,"
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
Right.
"I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan."
Right.
"And there are, there is a local firm that'll actually,"
"if, if,"
"like in my situation, I don't have that, because the loan was not available."
"I can have,"
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee.
"So I can cut that much off the end of,"
but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.
Oh really.
Yeah.
"But, uh, those are all great."
Uh-huh.
"The, the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built"
Uh-huh.
"it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,"
"mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, um, that loan."
Uh-huh.
"You can ask and you can wheel and deal,"
but it's not as open as it should be.
Yeah.
"He was pretty good,"
"but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age."
You can't play football at fifty-five.
Right.
"But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh,"
anything can be warped.
Yeah.
"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity safely."
Uh-huh.
Something to stay active at for a long time.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years."
"Yeah,"
and they can still get good at it.
"That's right,"

"Thomas Ellis was the first European settler in the area known today as Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area."
"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

"SS ""Calabria was a passenger and cargo steamship. AG Weser built her for Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was launched as D/S ""Werra and completed in 1922. (""D/S"" stands for ""Dampfschiff"" in German as ""SS"" stands for ""steamship"" in English.)"
"In 1935 she was bought by Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale, who renamed her Calabria. In 1937 she was sold to Lloyd Triestino."
"In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) was going to rename her Empire Inventor, but she was sunk before this had been done."
"The Allied Powers seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as prize ships or afterwards for war reparations. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from Bremer Vulkan, AG Vulcan Stettin and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; ""Werra"" among them."
"""Werra"" was one of a series of six sister ships that AG Weser built for NDL. ""Werra"" and were completed in 1922; , and in 1923 and in 1924."
"""Werra"" had two three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines and twin screws. Between them her two engines were rated at 604 NHP. ""Werra"" was equipped with wireless direction finding and submarine signalling."
"In 1935 NDL sold ""Werra"", ""Coblenz"" and ""Saarbrücken"" to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them ""Calabria"", ""Sicilia"" and ""Toscana"" and registered them in Genoa. In 1937 the three ships were sold to Lloyd Triestino, which registered ""Calabria"" in Trieste."
"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer."
"""Calabria"" left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Schütze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."
"The oldest man aboard was ""Calabria""s chief cook, Santan Martins, who was 79 years old. Martins may have been the oldest merchant seaman killed at sea in the Second World War."
"Those who died in ""Calabria""s sinking are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her Indian seamen and supernumaries are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai."

The film is a homage to the 1964 martial arts film ""Buddha's Palm"" which starred Cho Tat-wah, who also acts in a supporting role in this film."
"Advertising company staff Mo Tak-fai (Lau) and his friend Lai Chi (Chan) go to mainland China for a business trip. Chi smuggles some relics, leading to them being chased by the police. They go into a cave to escape capture, but Chi is bitten by a poisonous snake. He finds a medicine belonging to an ancient hero named Long Jianfei and shares it with Tak-fai. Not only does the medicine detoxifies Chi, it also bestows Tak-fai and Chi internal strengths. They also rescue Princess Yunluo (Wong) and her maid Xiao Man (Mui) from the Yuan Dynasty after 800 years of slumber but in the process also releasing a two-hundred-year-old evil martial arts expert Tian Can (Yuen)."
"Fai and Chi remain skeptical about the things that happened and they bring the two ladies to Hong Kong. Yunluo is able to adapt to modern life in Hong Kong very quickly. On the other hand, in order to defeat Tian Can, Yunluo helps Fai to learn the ""Buddha's Palm"" technique while Chi, due to poor qualifications, only excel at the ""Seven Rotary Slice"" technique. However, when Tian Can arrives he effortlessly defeats Fai since he has not mastered the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. Tian Can forces Fai to eat a cursed silkworm, which can cause pain to people who consume it when Tian Can plays his drum."
"The next day, Tian Can goes on a spree. He steals money from a bank ATM, threatens Fai and Chi to go to their boss' home and capture his family, as well as defeating the police who come after them. Yunluo saves the two men but Fai is furtherly injured by Tian Can in the process. Fortunately they come across Yim Chan, leader of a supernatural performing troupe from China, who heals Fai from his injuries while also channelling energy to him. A few days later, Fai finally masters the ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" technique. He and his friends confront Tian Can in a final duel and Fai uses ""Ten Thousand Buddhas"" to cripple Tian Can's martial arts ability, becoming a true hero in the end."

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

The Woodbine Formation is a Cretaceous geologic formation named for the small community in 1905.
"Settlement of the area known as Mineola began back in the 1840s, but the first residents did not become permanent until the mid-1860s. In 1879, the Denison and Pacific Railroad came through, and the community was renamed Woodbine for the abundant vines in the area.

"""No Good Advice"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle.
"From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service."
"The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964."

A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot.
"In knot theory, a ""knot"" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere"
and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:

Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).

"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."
"Burke, most popular for her role as Suzanne Sugarbaker on ""Designing Women"", reportedly utilized her own singing talents for the role of Bishop, and dyed her familiar brunette hair blonde to play the role. The theme song was ""Climb That Mountain High"" by Reba McEntire which was not a charted single; the tune was featured on Reba's 1990 MCA album ""Rumor Has It""."

It was pulled from the schedule in December 1992 and returned to ABC the following spring 1993 for six episodes before finally being canceled. In an attempt to infuse ratings, Burke brought her brunette hair back that spring (even refilming the opening credits to correspond with the change in hair color), in the sake of familiarity, but it did little to save it."

"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."

The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.
Jurby was historically subdivided into five treens:

"After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface."
"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."
"Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation."
"While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies."
"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."
"The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter."
"Max Nicholson of IGN gave ""Rise of The Turtles"" a rating of 8.5/10, saying ""The action sequences are fluid, fast-paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick."" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, ""in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new"". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is ""so polished and ell executed,"" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating ""A very strong start to the series, then, and one I’ve found myself revisiting frequently."""

"There are currently four versions of the Little Phatty. Aside from a few cosmetic differences (and price), all units have nearly identical sound generation circuitry."
"The earlier 'Tribute Edition', a limited run of 1200 units, featured blue LED lighting, wooden side panels and Bob Moog's signature decaled onto the convex back panel."

"The Singaporean government has established some five biosphere reserves in Singapore. There are namely: Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Chek Jawa, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
"One of the first notions of biosphere reserves in Singapore was thought up by the then-Singapore Botanical Gardens Supritendent N. C. Cantley who, in 1882, proposed that select areas of land be preserved. In as early as 1883, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (as it is now known) was established, making it the inaugural biosphere reserve in Singapore. The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison."
"When the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP) was legalized in 1992 Iskander joined the party, which was founded by Diaa al-Din Dawoud, but later left the party in 1998 along with other members of the ""new guard"" after disagreements with the party's leaders. Along with former ADNP cadre Hamdeen Sabahi, Iskander co-founded the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama""). He continued his activism, being instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian-Palestinian solidarity movement in 2000 after the start of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against the Israeli occupation. He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation."
"These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement. Iskander was one of the principal leaders of the movement and became a vocal opponent of the planned, succession of Gamal Mubarak, Hosni's son, to the presidency which Iskander criticized as ""presidential inheritance."""
"Iskander joined the youth-led protests of the 2011 Egyptian revolution on its first day, 25 January and was arrested by security forces while protesting in Cairo's Shobra district on the first day. He continued protesting after his release on 27 January. He became the Dignity Party's secretary-general in 2011. Iskander strongly condemned the killing of mostly Coptic Christians protesters during the Maspero demonstrations on 9 October. During the 2011-2012 Egyptian parliamentary election, Iskander represented the Dignity Party and was part of the Democratic Alliance. He won a seat in Cairo's First District (Al-Sahel)."

= = = Reflective subcategory = = =
"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."

"Aldegisel, Aldegisl, Aldgillis, Aldgisl, Aldgils or Eadgils (fl. c. 678) was the ruler of Frisia (as king or duke) in the late seventh century contemporarily with Dagobert II and a very obscure figure. All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate.

"OB 293 was a west-bound convoy of 37 ships, either in ballast or carrying trade goods, and sailed from Liverpool on 2 March 1941 bound for ports in North America."
"It was escorted by an escort group of two destroyers, and , and two corvettes, and . They were led by LtCdr Rowlands of ""Wolverine"", which would stay with them till they left the Western Approaches. (At this stage of the campaign escort groups were too scarce to provide ""end-to-end"" cover)."
On 6 March 1941 the convoy was sighted by commanded by Prien.
"After sending a sighting report he set to shadowing the convoy, being joined throughout the day by three other boats. They were (Kretschmer), (Matz) and (Eckermann)."
On the night of the 6/7 March the pack launched its attack.
"In the early hours of 7 March ""U-99"" slipped into the convoy from ahead, to attack on the surface; she torpedoed the tanker ""Athelbeach"", sinking her, and the whale factory ship ""Terje Viken"", which was damaged."
"""U-70"" hit a freighter ""Dunaff Head"", which sank, and a Dutch tanker, ""Mijdrecht""."
"She was only damaged, however, rounding on"" U-70"" and attempting to ram; ""U-70"" was forced to crash-dive to escape."
"""UA"" hit a freighter but did not sink her."
The response of the escorts was swift and effective. The U-boats were subjected to a fierce bombardment as the warships chased down contacts; over 100 depth charges were expended over a 5-hour period.
"""UA"" was damaged but was able to escape;"
"""U-99"" only escaped by diving deep and waiting out the attack."
"""U-70"" was damaged in the onslaught and forced to the surface, where she was fired on and sunk by the corvettes ""Camellia"" and ""Arbutus""."
"""U-47"" avoided damage and was able to stay in contact with the convoy, sending further reports and requesting re-inforcements. He had also been able to torpedo ""Terje Viken"", which was straggling after being damaged, though she still remained afloat. The escorts attempted to bring her to port, but she finally sank on the 14th; her loss was credited to both ""U-99"" and ""U-47""."
"Meanwhile, on the night of 7th/8th, at about 1am on the 8th, ""Wolverine"" sighted a U-boat on the surface which she identified as ""U-47"". She and "" Verity"" attacked, and after 4 hours, which had shown evidence of damage, the U-boat was driven to the surface within yards of ""Wolverine"", before diving again. The destroyer sent down a pattern of depth charges and was rewarded with an underwater explosion, marked by an orange glow, and flames that broke the surface."
"""Wolverine"" was credited with destroying ""U-47"", and this featured in the official record until the late 1990s. However, after reviewing the available records modern historians regard this attack as being directed against ""UA"", which was badly damaged, but survived to reach port."
"No conclusion can be reached about the fate of ""U-47"", and it is thought likely to be the result of a diving accident."
"The success of the defence of OB 293, with the loss of the U-boat ace Prien, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy HX-112, and the loss of two more aces, Kretschmer and Schepke, one week later, marks a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo ( 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II."
"Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy."
"Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as ""rector"" of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon."
"In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci ""rector"" of Tuscia (Tuscany), as well as ""capitano"" (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto ""Ascendit de mare""."
"When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year)."
"In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily."
"In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250.

"Baldwin 60000 is an experimental steam locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in 1926, during the height of the railroading industry. It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin."
"It was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is ."
"60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks."
"This locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more. In 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today."
"After a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons."
"Following testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades."
"In February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption."
"On 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad."
"In the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal."
"Converted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute."

The rails of westward track laying gangs reached this area in October 1884."
"Biscotasing is an access point for canoeists, fishermen, and back-country campers to the area including Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park. It has one general store that functions as the post office, tackle shop, grocery store and Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlet; a community centre; a church; and the one-room Biscotasing railway station served by Via Rail. The town also is accessible by floatplane and by a long drive on the Sultan Industrial Road. Although the year-round population is only 22, during the summer season, the population swells to around 300, mostly tourists."
"The early development of Biscotasing was dictated solely by the needs of the railway. The CPR acquired a parcel of land at Biscotasing in 1884 and by November had cleared . A frame station the size of 30 × , was constructed, with offices upstairs, a large freight shed 40 × , a telegraph office, several residences for company officials and a number of boarding houses were completed before the end of that year. A wye track had also been installed to allow work trains to turn around prior to returning to the east. Later a roundhouse was built to service the locomotives."

"Joseph H. ""Cyclone"" Miller (September 24, 1859 – October 13, 1916) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He played just two seasons in the majors, but did play with four teams in three leagues. He stood at 5'9""."
"Miller's major league career began in 1884 for the Chicago Browns/Pittsburgh Stogies of the Union Association. He lasted just one start, in which he threw a complete game victory, allowing only two runs. He then moved on to the Providence Grays, filling in the rotation due to injuries to their top pitchers, Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. Even though he did pitch well for long stretches during the games, he struggled to secure the victories in the late innings and had to be replaced. On July 31, 1884, in a road game versus the New York Gothams, he was appointed umpire due to the scheduled umpire calling in sick. The New York fans thought his calls were decidedly one-sided toward his Grays team, and he had to have a police escort off the field after the game. The game ended in a 3-3 tie."
"On one occasion, with Miller playing right field, the manager had wanted Sweeney to switch from pitcher to right field to bring in Miller to pitch in the 9th inning. Sweeney refused the move and walked off the field, and because of the rules during that time, Miller had to pitch the game with only two outfielders. He went on to lose the game, and Sweeney was suspended for a game to violating the manager's order. Instead of serving the suspension, Sweeney quit the team and joined the St. Louis Maroons of Union Association, leaving Radbourn to shoulder the team's pitching duties for the rest of the season. It was that season that Radbourn set his all-time record for wins with 60, which under today's rules would have only been 59 because in one game, he relieved Miller with Providence having the lead after five innings. On September 13, when the team departing on a lengthy road trip, they decided not to bring Miller along with them, thus ending his short tenure with the team. He compiled a 3–2 record with them in five starts and one relief appearance that resulted in a late-inning loss."
"He is also on record as having pitched one game for the Philadelphia Quakers during the 1884 season. In that game, he pitched a complete game loss, giving up 19 runs, 10 of them earned."
"Miller spent 1885 in the minor leagues. He started 1886 with Macon of the Southern Association but finished it with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He went 10-8 that season, completing all of his starts and throwing one shutout. On August 20, he threw a one-hitter, giving up his one hit in the ninth inning and losing 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, and their young fireballer Matt Kilroy. During this season, he played one game at third base, becoming one of only 36 left-handed players to have played at least one game at that position."

"Prajavani (PV) has a history of being a politically independent newspaper, although it tends to opine with a liberal tilt. It is known for espousing the causes of Dalits, encouraging women's empowerment and taking pro-poor positions on economic issues. It has managed to maintain an independent position, despite an increasingly polarized media landscape in Karnataka. Prajavani uses the tagline ""the most trusted Kannada daily newspaper"", which appears below its masthead."
"Prajavani was the leading Kannada newspaper for decades, until it was overtaken in circulation by ""Vijaya Karnataka"" (VK) in 2004. The gulf between PV and the upstart VK became huge for a while, but the two newspapers appear to be competing much more closely as of 2014, with PV having significantly recovered ground according to industry numbers. Some analysts have also attributed this to the launch of Vijaya Vani, by the original owner of Vijaya Karnataka, Vijay Sankeshwar and his VRL Group, which has apparently eaten into the readership of ""Vijaya Karnataka"". Other regional competitors include ""Udayavani"", ""Varthabharathi"", ""Kannada Prabha"" and ""Samyukta Karnataka""."

"In geometry, the snub icosidodecadodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U."
"As the name indicates, it belongs to the family of snub polyhedra."
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a snub icosidodecadodecahedron are all the even permutations of
"with an even number of plus signs, where"
and where τ = (1+)/2 is the golden mean and
"ρ is the real solution to ρ=ρ+1, or approximately 1.3247180."
ρ is called the plastic constant.
"Taking the odd permutations of the above coordinates with an odd number of plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one."
The medial hexagonal hexecontahedron is a nonconvex isohedral polyhedron. It is the dual of the uniform snub icosidodecadodecahedron.

"103rd Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 103rd Street and Broadway on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, within Manhattan Valley, it is served by the 1 train at all times."
"Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 103rd Street station."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"In 2002, it was announced that 103rd Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations."
"This station was part of the original subway, and has two side platforms and three tracks, the center one being an unused express track. The southbound local track is known as BB1 and the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for chaining purposes along the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street and not in everyday speech. Although it cannot be accessed at 103rd Street, the center track is designated as M."
"There is a mezzanine above the platforms, which contains the fare control area, as well as stairs to the street and both platforms."
"This is the southernmost 3-track station on the line. South of the station, there are switches that connect the express track to either local track, with trains then being able to crossover to the rising express tracks from the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. Under 103rd Street, the dual express tracks serving the southern part of the line descend and curve to the east to form the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. They turn off of Broadway and onto 104th Street directly underneath this station. An emergency exit from the Lenox Avenue Line is located in the middle of the northbound platform."
The station has four entrance/exit stairs that serve both platforms:
"A fifth, exit-only stair leads from the northbound platform to the SE corner of Broadway and 104th Street."
"The 103rd Street station was one of the settings in the William S. Burroughs book ""Junkie"" and was briefly featured in the film ""Black Swan""."

"The Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, commonly referred to as the Pittsburgh Marathon, is an annual marathon footrace held on the first Sunday in May in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984 with U.S. Steel and PNC Bank as sponsors. From 1985 to 2003, the race was held annually and named the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon, although serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race."
"The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course."
"Aside from the main marathon event, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a half marathon, two to five person marathon relay, 5k race, and ""kids marathon."" All races except for the ""kids marathon"" and 5k utilize the same route and starting time as the marathon. Attendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race. Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants distributed in the 5K. Additionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance. 2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5k selling out on or before March 6, 2012."
"Historically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh's at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either Downtown or North Shore. Previous finish lines have included Point State Park, David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and the 50 yard-line of Heinz Field. The current finish line is on the Boulevard of the Allies near Point State Park. Numerous other historic and well-known Pittsburgh neighborhoods are along the route, including the South Side, Oakland, Shadyside, East Liberty, Highland Park, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, and the Strip District."
"Throughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations. Neighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route. Sixty bands, almost all of which are from the Greater Pittsburgh area, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres."
"The Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for men in 2000 and the US Olympic Trials for women in 1988. In addition, it has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s."

"Also in 1981, William Bennett, head of the band Whitehouse and the British Come Org. label, offered Bianchi a record contract, which Bianchi signed unchecked. It was based on a ""joke contract"" that Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound had sketched. The contract assumed all rights to Bianchi's work. After delivery of the tapes Bennett edited-in speeches by Nazi leaders, and instead of the relatively unsensational name MB, it was published under the alias ""Leibstandarte SS MB"", named after the SS unit that worked as bodyguards to Adolf Hitler."

= = = Fadeaway = = =
"A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block."
"The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound."
"The shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender."
"Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook."

"The growth of Hamilton's economic landscape during the late 19th and early 20th century is accredited to textile production, the city's second largest industry, second only to the steel mills. The men responsible for this city's economic expansion are the ""5 Johns"" of Hamilton (John Morison Gibson, John Moodie, John Sutherland, John Dickenson and John Patterson). The men opened the ""Catract Power Company"" in 1896 which brought cheap electricity to the city. They were Hamilton's major landowners in the region, both of which brought manufactures and entrepreneurs from all over North America."
"The general manager of the company was Charles T. Crantham, pioneer of the cotton duck industry in Canada and responsible for the creation of the Imperial Cotton Company Ltd. From Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Grantham was the bookkeeper for a cotton duck mill in 1883 to fix the company's books. Four years after his employment, he resigned to open a rival company in Hamilton, Ontario; bringing with him many workers and experts. Grantham had the help of John Patterson of the ""5 Johns"" to fund his cotton mill venture and build the cotton mill on the land that he owned. It was also decided that his brother Edmond Patterson would be the architect. By, 1900, the Imperial Cotton Company"" ""was born and looked after by James M. Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860–1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats."
"The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers. The products of the company are sold mainly to manufacturers, cutters-up, railways, implement and paper makers."
"The Cotton Factory has always been a ""people first"" kind of place.

"Vicia villosa, known as the hairy vetch, fodder vetch or winter vetch, is a plant native to some of Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state — as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces."
"Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (""Vicia cracca""), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem."
Several subspecies are recognized:
"The species ""Vicia hirsuta"" is also called hairy vetch."
"Hairy vetch is widely used by organic growers in the United States as a winter cover crop and in no-till farming, as it is both winter hardy and can fix as much as 200 lb/acre of atmospheric nitrogen. Disadvantages of hairy vetch in production agriculture are related to the crop having a portion of hard seed and its tendency to shatter seed early in the season, leading to it remaining in the field as a weed later in the season. This can be a particular problem in wheat production."
"Organic gardeners often plant hairy vetch (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a companion plant to tomatoes, as an alternative to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is time to plant tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting."
"It is regulated in the state of Florida. Some sources consider it generally invasive in areas with suitable climate for it to out-compete native species, in a manner similar to how cow vetch, ""Vicia cracca"", is regarded. With both vetches, their agricultural usefulness is typically given precedence over concerns regarding potential ecological degradation. Despite being native to part of Europe it is considered an alien or invasive species in some European countries, such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain."

"In 2003, Cabinet approved the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, who said that new regulations were needed to cater for changes in the aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes in the last few years to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). These included Certification of Service Providers; Regulatory Functions; Airworthiness of Aircraft; Licensing; and Flight Operations and Rules of the Air.

"Suleman had tapped into Sydney's Assyrian community, many of whom had remortgaged their homes."
"In April 2004, Suleman was jailed for 21 months, with a 12-month non-parole period, for four fraud offences."
"Two days shy of being released from a 21-month jail term in 2005 the corporate regulator struck again, laying 26 new charges."
Karl Suleman Enterprizes fleeced 2062 investors who committed $130.7 million between them – by inviting them to invest in a trolley collection business that promised investors returns of 100 per cent a year.
"But instead of their money going into that business, the money was used to fund Suleman's extravagant lifestyle."
"Suleman and his wife Vivienne bought properties, luxury cars, boats and planes, sponsored charity events and gave lavish gifts as well as dinners for former United States presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton."
Some of the money was used to service a $13 million loan taken out to finance a range of IT and mobile phone ventures under the Froggy Group banner.
"Documents filed with the court by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed that investors, mostly from Sydney's Assyrian community, were induced to put between $50,000 and $150,000 into the trolley business on the promise that they would receive fortnightly returns of between $4000 and $25,000."
"While investors received some fortnightly payments as promised, the money earned by the trolley collection business fell well short of being sufficient to sustain the promised payments."
"The company's liquidators said in their report that between July 2000 and November 2001 the business made a net profit of $275,096 but was paying out $2 million a week to investors seeking high returns."
"Suleman started the trolley business in 1993, providing trolley collections from supermarkets stretching from Cairns to Adelaide. Supermarkets paid Suleman an agreed fee out of which he paid subcontractors to do the work."
The District Court heard 15 people invested more than $3 million in Suleman's supermarket trolley collection business in 2000 and 2001.
"Thirteen of them lost a total of more than $800,000."
The founder of the Froggy Group – was sentenced to 7 and a half years jail after pleading guilty to 26 charges.
The judge found Suleman knew the income from his business was not enough to repay the investors.
"He said it was serious white collar crime, and that Suleman had breached the trust of naive investors so he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income."
"Two years after being released from jail on 20 June 2013, 52-year-old Suleman suffered a heart attack at his home in Horningsea Park Sydney."

The sanctuary is bordered by the Brahmaputra and the Dishang rivers in the north west and south respectively.
"As many as 267 species of birds including 70 species of migratory birds have been identified and recorded at Pani Dihing. The common birds seen here are bar-headed goose, greylag goose, spot-billed duck, mallards, gadwall, wigeon, garganey, shoveller, red crested pochard, common pochard, ferruginous duck, adjutant stork, kingfisher, lesser adjutant stork, open bill stork, white necked stork. The rare griffon and white-rumped vultures have also been spotted at the sanctuary."
"Although an important birding area supporting a very large population of birds, Pani Dihing has suffered on account of poaching, grazing of cattle and fishing within the sanctuary premises."

Betty Margaret Burstall (4 February 192614 June 2013) was an Australian theatre director who founded the La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in 1967. Burstall and her theatre are credited with leading the growth of contemporary theatre in Melbourne during the 1960s and 1970s.
"Burstall was inspired to establish the theatre after returning from New York City. She introduced off-Broadway contemporary theatre to Melbourne through La Mama. Numerous actors and writers have appeared and worked at La Mama, including Graeme Blundell, Kerry Dwyer, Jack Hibberd, and John Romeril, all of whom formed the Australian Performing Group. In 1976, Burstall turned over the day-to-day operations of La Mama to Liz Jones, who remains the theatre's artistic director as of 2013. Burstall remained the chief script adviser until about 1998."
"Betty Burstall was predeceased by husband, film director Tim Burstall, in 2004. She died on 14 June 2013, at the age of 87, survived by two sons and their wives, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. The actress Sigrid Thornton is her daughter-in-law."

"Lotika Sarkar (4 January 1923 – 23 February 2013) was a noted Indian feminist, social worker, educator and lawyer, who was a pioneer in the field of women's studies and women's rights in India. She was a founding member of Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), Delhi, established in 1980, and also Indian Association for Women Studies, established in 1982. Starting in 1951, she taught law at Faculty of Law, University of Delhi till 1983, and also remained the head of the Law Faculty, thereafter she taught at Indian Law Institute. She was the first Indian woman to graduate from Cambridge University, and later in 1951 she also became the first woman to receive a PhD degree in law from the university."
"Born in 1923, she was raise in an aristocratic family in West Bengal, where her father Sir Dhiren Mitra was leading lawyer of India."
"Sarkar studied law at Newnham College, Cambridge and became the first Indian woman to study and also then graduate from the university. Later she wrote a PhD in Law, also at Cambridge University, awarded in 1951. Thereafter in 1960, she studied international law at the Harvard University, where she was one of four Indian students, returning to India in 1961."
"In 1953, when Sarkar started teaching at the Law Faculty, University of Delhi, she was the first female lecturer in the faculty. Law was still a new field for women, initially there were only 10 girls in the course, a number which grew to 80–100 by the 1960s . She taught here till 1983, teaching eminent jurist and lawyers, and finally became the Head of the Law Faculty, and also the university don."
"In 1971, she became a member of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (CSWI), where along with her colleague, Vina Mazumdar, who joined in 1973 as Member-Secretary, there went on to publish the seminal, ""Towards Equality: The Report of the Committee on the Status of Women in India"" (1974–75) In 1979, the Supreme Court of India reversed the judgment of Bombay High Court in the Mathura rape case, in which two policemen were sentenced for raping of sixteen-year-old girl within a police station. The acquittal, went largely unnoticed until September 1979, when professors Upendra Baxi, Raghunath Kelkar and Sarkar of Delhi University and Vasudha Dhagamwar of Pune, wrote an open letter to the Supreme Court, protesting the concept of consent in the judgment. ""Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."" Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, ""Forum Against Rape"", widespread protests followed and eventually Indian Penal Code was amended."
"In 1980, she became a founder member of Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), Delhi, founded by Vina Mazumdar, and which went on to become an influential institution, impacting the course of women's studies in India. Through the 1980s and 90s, she taught criminal law at the Indian Law Institute in Delhi. She was also a founding member of Indian Association for Women's Studies, established in 1982."
"She met Chanchal Sarkar in 1951, while he too was studying at Cambridge, they married in 1957. Chanchal Sarkar went on to become an eminent journalist, assistant editor of ""The Statesman"" and founding director of the Press Institute of India in 1963; he died on 10 October 2005 in Delhi. The couple had no children."
"She continued to live thereafter at their Hauz Khas, Delhi residence, which she was disposed of January 2009 by the tenants, which led to a media furore Several leading intellectuals, jurists, academics, journalists, activists and over a dozen national groups and institutions came forward in her support demanding speedy justice, some even met the President, before the house was restored to her by the courts in November 2009."

"As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals."
"The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003."
"The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case."
"In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less."
"This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer."
Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15. Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win. and 6mm Rem. are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform.
"The 243 WSSM is 3/8 inch shorter than the 243 Win. giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle."
The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

"Rolling Thunder was a racing wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, NJ. Rolling Thunder was the park's first wooden coaster, and debuted in 1979 during the park's fifth anniversary season. It closed in 2013."
"Rolling Thunder opened in 1979. To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the USA, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed ""Rednuht Gnillor,"" the backwards spelling of ""Rolling Thunder,"" in 1984. The trains were turned around so riders would view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so riders could see them."
Rolling Thunder was standing but not operating in September and October 2005 and through most of the Spring of 2006 due to the construction of the Plaza del Carnival section and El Toro.
"Rolling Thunder closed on September 8, 2013, to make room for . Soon after Rolling Thunder closed, it was demolished, except for one part of the track which is still standing."
"The line for the ride began at an adjoining entrance and had separate queues for each track. The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height would ride Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement."
"Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced."
"The structure and track was mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas Fir. In the past, the Douglas Fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine."
"The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides."
"Using the Batavia Institute as the basis for its proposal, Batavia submitted a bid for the Illinois normal school in 1857. A normal school or teachers college is an educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The State of Illinois passed an act to establish a normal school on 18 February 1857—the second west of the Appalachian Mountains."
"Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857. The first proposition on the agenda was from Batavia, which offered a subscription of $15,000, with the land and building belonging to the Batavia Institute, valued at $30,000, making $45,000 in all. Washington, in Tazewell County, Bloomington, and Peoria submitted proposals, as well. After considerable discussion, a resolution was adopted locating the new university at Bloomington—actually north of town at the village of North Bloomington, which was renamed Normal in 1865, for the school. Illinois State University celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007."
"The building and grounds of the Batavia Institute were sold in 1867 to Dr. Richard J. Patterson, who, as proprietor and medical superintendent, operated it as a private rest home and sanitarium for women, called Bellevue Place. The sanitarium operated until July 1965. The most notable patient was Mary Todd Lincoln, widow of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was a patient for several months in the summer of 1875."
"In the 1960s, the building was converted to a residential facility for unwed mothers called the Fox Hill Home. The Fox Hill Home operated into the 1970s when the building fell into disrepair."
"In the middle of the 1980s, the building was once again named Bellevue Place and converted into apartments."
The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Place on 13 August 1976.

Guest stars included David Harewood, Rhys Ifans, Gary Lineker, Danny John-Jules and Nicholas Parsons."
"""Spatz"" was devised by Andrew Bethell as a drama for teenagers set in a 1930s themed burger bar, so named because spats might have been worn there. Alan Horrox at Thames Television bought the concept and title and passed them to Grant Cathro and Lee Pressman, already established at Thames Television as the writers of ""T-Bag"" and creators of ""Mike and Angelo"", to develop ""Spatz"" as a sitcom. While updating the setting to a standard fast food restaurant, the name ""Spatz"" was retained, with the writers noting that it suggested spats or disagreements."

Furthermore, the author point out that a sustainable metals management cannot be defined in isolation, because a global issue like this is linked to many other issues at the global level: population and welfare increase, the concurrent expected rise in demand for food, water, and energy, the availability of metals and other non-renewable materials, the shift to a renewable energy system, dietary choices, etc. Therefore it should be part of an overall effort to steer society towards a more sustainable development."
"The production of different metals has different potentials to impact the environment. The report gives reasons to why metals can become relatively more important from an environmental impact point of view. First of all, the demand for most metals is rising rapidly and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Secondly, a shift towards a renewable energy system implies that the material, especially metal, intensity of energy production will increase substantially. Thirdly, in the future, the energy intensity of production of metals is expected to increase due to the use of lesser grade of ores."

= = = Law enforcement in Illinois = = =
Law enforcement in Illinois is complex with many overlapping jurisdictions related to the administrative divisions of Illinois.
"At the state level, there are at least eleven law enforcement agencies. At the county level, there are sheriffs, forest preserve police and other specialized police forces. At the local level, most cities and many villages have municipal police forces, park district police forces, and even local specialized police forces. Many colleges also have their own campus police that are often sworn police officers."
"In 2000, Illinois was ranked 4th in the U.S. in the number of full-time sworn officers with 321 per 100,000 persons, behind Louisiana (415), New York (384), and New Jersey (345). In this ranking, only New York had a higher total population than Illinois. Illinois is also near the top of most law enforcement numbers lists, such as number of agencies per state, number of agencies with special jurisdictions, and number of local police agencies. Even taking into account that Illinois is the fifth most populous state, many of the ratios are higher than more populated states."
= = = Barbara Wheeler = = =
"Barbara Wheeler (born in 1967 or 1968) was a Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 64th district. The district contains parts of Lake County and McHenry County. Wheeler was first elected in 2012 and was inaugurated to the House on January 9, 2013."
"Wheeler was a Peace Corps volunteer. She received education degrees from Loyola University Chicago and National Louis University, and worked as a teacher at Wauconda Middle School. She moved to Crystal Lake in 1998."
Wheeler served on the McHenry County Board from 2002 to 2012. In 2012 she was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in the newly redrawn 64th district. She faced no opposition in the primary or general elections.
Wheeler did not run for re-election in 2018.
= = = Nanosheet = = =
A nanosheet is a two-dimensional nanostructure with thickness in a scale ranging from 1 to 100 nm.
"A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest two-dimensional material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices."
Silicon nanosheets are being used to prototype future generations of small (5 nm) transistors.
Carbon nanosheets (from hemp) may be an alternative to graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors.
"The most commonly used nanosheet synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir–Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations can be used to prove the experimental process."
"Ultrathin single-crystal PbS (lead sulfur) sheets with micro scale in x-, y- dimensions can be obtained using a hot colloidal synthesis method. Compounds with linear chloroalkanes like 1,2-dichloroethane containing chlorine were used during the formation of PbS sheets. PbS ultrathin sheets probably resulted from the oriented attachment of the PbS nanoparticles in a two-dimensional fashion. The highly reactive facets were preferentially consumed in the growth process that led to the sheet-like PbS crystal growth."
"Nanosheets can also be prepared at room temperature. For instance, hexagonal PbO (lead oxide)) nanosheets were synthesized using gold nanoparticles as seeds under room temperature. The size of the PbO nanosheet can be tuned by gold NPs and concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons for the formation of the PbO nanosheets. The same process was observed for iron sulfide nanoparticles."
Carbon nanosheets have been produced using industrial hemp bast fibres with a technique that involves heating the fibres at over 350F (180C) for 24 hours. The result is then subjected to intense heat causing the fibers to exfoliate into a carbon nanosheet. This has been used to create an electrode for a supercapacitor with electrochemical qualities ‘on a par with’ devices made using graphene.
"Metal nanosheets have also been synthesized from solution-based method by reducing metal precursors, including palladium, rhodium, and gold."

= = = FS Class E.424 = = =
The FS E.424 is a class of Italian railways electric locomotives. They were built in 1943-1951 and have been decommissioned in 2008.
"A design for a small multi-service Bo-Bo locomotive, with speed up to , had been devised by Giuseppe Bianchi as early as in the 1930s, but the project had been halted by the introduction of the E.326 and E.428. After the realization of the 6-axle E.636, it was however decided to revamp the project by adapting to it some solutions already in use on the E.636 (engines, bogies, suspension etc.)."
"Breda SpA workshop provided the three prototypes of E.424 in 1943-1944. Mass production, however, could begin only after the end of World War II, part of the funds provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration program."
The locomotives have been built in four series starting from year 1943:
"Class E.424, having DC type motors like all the Italian locomotives of the time, is a rheostatic-type locomotive; on start, a rheostat is connected in series to the motors and is gradually excluded as speed builds up allowing more current to flow to the motors; unlike other rheostatic locomotives of that time, this is not achieved via the characteristic lever (""Maniglione""), but through an automatic system, called ""Avviatore Automatico"", derived from contemporary first-generation ALe 790/880/883 EMUs."
"The driver simply selects the combination (series or parallel), and the relative rheostat contactors are automatically and gradually closed by this system; in case of failure, the driver can manually rotate an apposite wheel (that also usually rotates automatically as the system advances) to proceed with the exclusion."
"When the rheostat is completely excluded for the series combination, field shunts can be inserted, or the driver can proceed to parallel combination, making a transition, which is handled by a device called ""CEM"" that automatically combines the motors (closing various contacts) accordingly."
"Originally more than one unit could be coupled and be controlled remotely by the first locomotive using a system called ""Comando Multiplo""; on the central part of the cab there also was a door that enabled the crew to pass from one locomotive to another in case of problems. However, because of safety issues and the imperfect reliability of this system (there were no instruments indicating the status of the slave locomotive, so it was not certain if it correctly made a transition or not, for example), it was abandoned and then disassembled."
"Eleven units received compound-type motors, enabling a very fine speed control, in a range included between in series combination, and in parallel."
= = = Mustang Aeronautics Mustang II = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Mustang II is a two-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding.
"Robert Bushby acquired the rights to the Long Midget Mustang in 1959 and four years later began development of a two-seat, side-by-side version. This eventually flew in 1966 and plans were made available soon thereafter. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992."
"A single engine in tractor configuration airplane, the Mustang II features cantilever low-wing, two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear, or, optionally, tricycle landing gear."
"The aircraft is made from riveted sheet aluminum with a rounded turtle deck and flat sides and bottom skins. Its span wing employs a NACA 64A212 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a NACA 64A210 at the wingtip. Standard engines used include the Lycoming O-320, the Lycoming O-360 and the fuel-injected Lycoming IO-360 four-stroke powerplants. Standard fuel capacity is 25 US gallons, but optional wet wings increase the fuel capacity to 61 US gallons. Several other fuel tank options are available. A folding wing option may be installed."

In an attempted burglary at Mordaunt's home, his love interest, Mrs. Rosemary Delgado (Jane Hylton), is suspected. She was once romantically linked to a gangster and she leads the Westlakes in a search for Achemd's writings, a middle eastern 14th Century seer which has inspired an extreme political group, and thought to be in the collection of rare books that Mourdaunt now owns."
"The Westlakes become embroiled in a struggle over the valuable Arabic manuscripts, and when Susie is kidnapped by extremists, Bob works as an assistant to Tom Cookson, a manuscript smuggler (Hugh Moxey) who is importing the rare texts the gang are seeking. The extremists demand Mourdaunt turn over his collection of rare books, and plot to incite a revolution across the Middle East but can the Westlakes prevent a serious international situation?"
"Principal photography on ""You Pay Your Money"" took place in the Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England."
"In a review of ""You Pay Your Money"", the ""Radio Times"" wrote, ""The much maligned Butcher's Film Service holds an unenviable place in the history of British cinema. By sponsoring dozens of low-budget programmers, it enabled young talent on both sides of the camera to gain an industry foothold.

Mulatu Teshome was elected by the parliament to a six-year term. Incumbent president Girma Wolde-Giorgis is barred from seeking re-election due to term limits."
"As a parliamentary republic, most administrative power and the effective ability is vested in the prime minister and his government, rather than the president, leaving the president as primarily a figurehead executive. However, the president retains significant Reserve powers granted by the constitution."
"A presidential candidate is required to be elected by a joint session of the upper house and lower house of the Ethiopian parliament, the Federal Parliamentary Assembly, the House of Federation and the House of People's Representatives, respectively."
"Several persons have been the subject of speculation by various media sources as potential candidates in the election. The past two presidents, Negasso Gidada, and Girma Wolde-Giorgis, have hailed from the Oromo ethnic group, the country's largest, and thus it has been speculated that the ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, will again nominate an Oromo candidate."

"In geometry, the great dodecahemidodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
"Aside from the regular small stellated dodecahedron {/,5} and great stellated dodecahedron {/,3}, it is the only nonconvex uniform polyhedron whose faces are all non-convex regular polygons (star polygons), namely the star polygons {/} and {/}."

"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling.

"The affine tangent bundle formula_7 admits an affine connection formula_24 which is associated to a principal connection on an affine frame bundle formula_8. In affine gauge theory, it is treated as an ""affine gauge field""."
"Given the linear bundle coordinates (1) on formula_26, an affine connection formula_24 is represented by a connection tangent-valued form"
This affine connection defines a unique linear connection
"on formula_4, which is associated to a principal connection on formula_12."
"Conversely, every linear connection formula_32 (4) on formula_33 is extended to the affine one formula_34 on formula_7 which is given by the same expression (4) as formula_32 with respect to the bundle coordinates (1) on formula_26, but it takes a form"
relative to the affine coordinates (2).
Then any affine connection formula_24 (3) on formula_40 is represented by a sum
of the extended linear connection formula_34 and a basic soldering form
"on formula_4, where formula_45 due to the canonical isomorphism formula_46 of the vertical tangent bundle formula_47 of formula_7."
"Relative to the linear coordinates (1), the sum (5) is brought into a sum formula_49"
"of a linear connection formula_32 and the soldering form formula_51 (6). In this case, the soldering form formula_51 (6) often is treated as a ""translation gauge field"", though it is not a connection."
"Let us note that a true translation gauge field (i.e., an affine connection which yields a flat linear connection on formula_4) is well defined only on a parallelizable manifold formula_1."
"In field theory, one meets a problem of physical interpretation of translation gauge fields because there are no fields subject to gauge translations formula_55. At the same time, one observes such a field in gauge theory of dislocations in continuous media because, in the presence of dislocations, displacement vectors formula_56, formula_57, of small deformations are determined only with accuracy to gauge translations formula_58."
"In this case, let formula_2, and let an affine connection take a form"
"with respect to the affine bundle coordinates (2). This is a translation gauge field whose coefficients formula_61 describe plastic distortion, covariant derivatives formula_62 coincide with elastic distortion, and a strength formula_63 is a dislocation density."
Equations of gauge theory of dislocations are derived from a gauge invariant Lagrangian density
"where formula_65 and formula_66 are the Lamé parameters of isotropic media. These equations however are not independent since a displacement field formula_67 can be removed by gauge translations and, thereby, it fails to be a dynamic variable."
"In gauge gravitation theory on a world manifold formula_1, one can consider an affine, but not linear connection on the tangent bundle formula_4 of formula_1. Given bundle coordinates (1) on formula_4, it takes the form (3) where the linear connection formula_32 (4) and the basic soldering form formula_51 (6) are considered as independent variables."
"As was mentioned above, the soldering form formula_51 (6) often is treated as a translation gauge field, though it is not a connection. On another side, one mistakenly identifies formula_51 with a tetrad field. However, these are different mathematical object because a soldering form is a section of the tensor bundle formula_76, whereas a tetrad field is a local section of a Lorentz reduced subbundle of a frame bundle formula_12."
"In the spirit of the above-mentioned gauge theory of dislocations, it has been suggested that a soldering field formula_51 can describe ""sui generi"" deformations of a world manifold formula_1 which are given by a bundle morphism"
where formula_81 is a tautological one-form.
Then one considers metric-affine gravitation theory formula_82 on a deformed world manifold as that with a deformed pseudo-Riemannian metric formula_83 when a Lagrangian of a soldering field formula_51 takes a form
"where formula_86 is the Levi-Civita symbol, and"
is the torsion of a linear connection formula_32 with respect to a soldering form formula_51.
"In particular, let us consider this gauge model in the case of small gravitational and soldering fields whose matter source is a point mass. Then one comes to a modified Newtonian potential of the fifth force type."
