"he buys her diamond rings you know, she said so"
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
`` What kind of a Christmas did you have ? ''
`` We did n't have any . ''
`` No Christmas ! ''
"said Amy , quite overcome ."
"`` Oh , well , I suppose you are going to have a good time on New Year 's instead . ''"
Bertie shook his head .
"`` No 'm , I guess not ."
We never have it different from other times . ''
Amy was silent from sheer amazement .
"Edith understood better , and she changed the subject ."
"`` Have you any brothers or sisters , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No 'm , '' returned Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I guess there 's enough of us without that .
I must be going now .
I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
"Edith slipped from the room as he spoke , and met him again at the door ."
She held out a pair of warm-looking mittens .
"`` These are for William John , '' she said simply , `` so that you can have your own ."
They are a pair of mine which are too big for me .
I know Papa will say it is all right .
"Goodbye , Bertie . ''"
"`` Goodbye -- and thank you , '' stammered Bertie , as the door closed ."
Then he hastened home to William John .
That evening Doctor Forbes noticed a peculiarly thoughtful look on Edith 's face as she sat gazing into the glowing coal fire after dinner .
He laid his hand on her dark curls inquiringly .
`` What are you musing over ? ''
"`` There was a little boy here today , '' began Edith ."
"`` Oh , such a dear little boy , '' broke in Amy eagerly from the corner , where she was playing with her kitten ."
`` His name was Bertie Ross .
"He brought up the parcels , and we asked him in to get warm ."
"He had no mittens , and his hands were almost frozen ."
"And , oh , Papa , just think !"
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` There now ! ''
he said in tearless despair .
`` That 's just what I expected .
"I did s ` pose if I could n't go you would , and tell me about it ."
You 're mean as mean can be . ''
"`` Come now , William John , do n't be so cross ."
"I thought you 'd rather have me home , but I 'll go , if you want me to . ''"
"`` Honest , now ? ''"
"`` Yes , honest ."
I 'll go anywhere to please you .
I must be off to the store now .
Goodbye . ''
"Thus committed , Bertie took his courage in both hands and went ."
The next evening at dusk found him standing at Doctor Forbes 's door with a very violently beating heart .
He was carefully dressed in his well-worn best suit and a neat white collar .
The frosty air had crimsoned his cheeks and his hair was curling round his face .
"Caroline opened the door and showed him into the parlour , where Edith and Amy were eagerly awaiting him ."
"`` Happy New Year , Bertie , '' cried Amy ."
"`` And -- but , why , where is William John ? ''"
"`` He could n't come , '' answered Bertie anxiously -- he was afraid he might not be welcome without William John ."
`` He 's real sick .
He caught cold and has to stay in bed ; but he wanted to come awful bad . ''
"`` Oh , dear me !"
Poor William John ! ''
said Amy in a disappointed tone .
But all further remarks were cut short by the entrance of Doctor Forbes .
`` How do you do ? ''
"he said , giving Bertie 's hand a hearty shake ."
`` But where is the other little fellow my girls were expecting ? ''
Bertie patiently reaccounted for William John 's non-appearance .
"`` It 's a bad time for colds , '' said the doctor , sitting down and attacking the fire ."
"`` I dare say , though , you have to run so fast these days that a cold could n't catch you ."
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
`` That would be better than if I explained it .
"Besides , I do n't think I could explain it ."
Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out : ` The gift without the giver is bare . ' ''
"`` I 'd put it the other way and say , ` The giver without the gift is bare , ' '' said Clorinda , with a grimace ."
`` That is my predicament exactly .
"Well , I hope by next Christmas I 'll not be quite bankrupt ."
I 'm going into Mr. Callender 's store down at Murraybridge in February .
"He has offered me the place , you know . ''"
`` Wo n't your aunt miss you terribly ? ''
said Aunt Emmy gravely .
Clorinda flushed .
There was a note in Aunt Emmy 's voice that disturbed her .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose she will , '' she answered hurriedly ."
`` But she 'll get used to it very soon .
"And I will be home every Saturday night , you know ."
"I 'm dreadfully tired of being poor , Aunt Emmy , and now that I have a chance to earn something for myself I mean to take it ."
"I can help Aunt Mary , too ."
I 'm to get four dollars a week . ''
"`` I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` But of course you must decide for yourself , dear ."
It is hard to be poor .
I know it .
I am poor . ''
`` You poor ! ''
"said Clorinda , kissing her ."
"`` Why , you are the richest woman I know , Aunt Emmy -- rich in love and goodness and contentment . ''"
"`` And so are you , dearie ... rich in youth and health and happiness and ambition ."
Are n't they all worth while ? ''
"`` Of course they are , '' laughed Clorinda ."
"`` Only , unfortunately , Christmas gifts ca n't be coined out of them . ''"
`` Did you ever try ? ''
asked Aunt Emmy .
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"In a short time they returned with the mattress , and Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds ."
"Lynde walked behind them , seemingly unconscious of both ."
She watched the stranger 's face as one fascinated .
"At Four Winds they carried the man to a room where Emily and Alan worked over him , while Lynde heated water and hunted out stimulants in a mechanical fashion ."
When Alan came down she asked no questions but looked at him with the same strained horror on her face which it had borne ever since Alan had dropped his burden at her feet .
`` Is he -- conscious ? ''
"asked Lynde , as if she forced herself to ask the question ."
"`` Yes , he has come back to life ."
But he is delirious and does n't realize his surroundings at all .
He thinks he is still on board the vessel .
He 'll probably come round all right .
Emily is going to watch him and I 'll go up to Rexton and send Dr. Ames down . ''
`` Do you know who that man you have saved is ? ''
asked Lynde .
`` No .
I asked him his name but could not get any sensible answer . ''
`` I can tell you who he is -- he is Frank Harmon . ''
Alan stared at her .
`` Frank Harmon .
Your -- your -- the man you married ?
Impossible ! ''
`` It is he .
Do you think I could be mistaken ? ''
* * * * * Dr. Ames came to Four Winds that night and again the next day .
He found Harmon delirious in a high fever .
"`` It will be several days before he comes to his senses , '' he said ."
`` Shall I send you help to nurse him ? ''
"`` It is n't necessary , '' said Emily stiffly ."
`` I can look after him -- and the Captain ought to be back tomorrow . ''
"`` You 've no idea who he is , I suppose ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` No . ''
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
`` No ! ''
"shrieked Tinker Bell , who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest ."
`` Why not ? ''
`` It is poisoned . ''
`` Poisoned ?
Who could have poisoned it ? ''
`` Hook . ''
`` Do n't be silly .
How could Hook have got down here ? ''
"Alas , Tinker Bell could not explain this , for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly 's tree ."
Nevertheless Hook 's words had left no room for doubt .
The cup was poisoned .
"`` Besides , '' said Peter , quite believing himself `` I never fell asleep . ''"
He raised the cup .
"No time for words now ; time for deeds ; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught , and drained it to the dregs ."
"`` Why , Tink , how dare you drink my medicine ? ''"
But she did not answer .
Already she was reeling in the air .
`` What is the matter with you ? ''
"cried Peter , suddenly afraid ."
"`` It was poisoned , Peter , '' she told him softly ; `` and now I am going to be dead . ''"
"`` O Tink , did you drink it to save me ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But why , Tink ? ''"
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now , but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite ."
"She whispered in his ear `` You silly ass , '' and then , tottering to her chamber , lay down on the bed ."
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress .
Every moment her light was growing fainter ; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more .
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it .
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said .
Then he made it out .
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
Her eyes brightened when she saw the mayflowers he carried .
"She came and took them from him , and her hands touched his , sending a little thrill of joy through him ."
`` How lovely they are !
And the first I have seen this spring .
"You always bring me the first , do n't you , Jeff ?"
Do you remember the first day we spent picking mayflowers together ? ''
Jeff smiled .
Could he forget ?
But something held him back from speech .
"Sara put the flowers in a vase on the table , but slipped one starry pink cluster into the lace on her breast ."
"She came and sat down beside Jeffrey ; he saw that her beautiful eyes had been weeping , and that there were lines of pain around her lips ."
Some impulse that would not be denied made him lean over and take her hand .
She left it unresistingly in his clasp .
"`` I am very lonely now , Jeff , '' she said sadly ."
`` Father has gone .
I have no friends left . ''
"`` You have me , '' said Jeffrey quietly ."
`` Yes .
I should n't have said that .
"You are my friend , I know , Jeff ."
"But , but -- I must leave Pinehurst , you know . ''"
"`` I learned that tonight for the first time , '' he answered ."
"`` Did you ever come to a place where everything seemed ended -- where it seemed that there was nothing -- simply nothing -- left , Jeff ? ''"
she said wistfully .
"`` But , no , it could n't seem so to a man ."
Only a woman could fully understand what I mean .
That is how I feel now .
While I had Father to live for it was n't so hard .
But now there is nothing .
And I must go away . ''
`` Is there anything I can do ? ''
muttered Jeffrey miserably .
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
`` None in the world . ''
She looked at him through and through a moment longer .
"Then , seeming satisfied with her scrutiny , she picked up her pail ."
"`` Come down to the spring with me , '' she said ."
"As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Emily began abruptly ."
"`` If you do n't know why Lynde is acting so , I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know either ."
I do n't even know if she is angry .
I only thought perhaps she was -- that you had done or said something to vex her -- plaguing her to go to church maybe .
"But if you did n't , it may not be anger at all ."
I do n't understand that girl .
She 's been different ever since her mother died .
She used to tell me everything before that .
You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong .
But maybe I can tell you something .
Did you write her a letter a fortnight ago ? ''
`` A letter ?
No . ''
"`` Well , she got one then ."
I thought it came from you -- I did n't know who else would be writing to her .
A boy brought it and gave it to her at the door .
She 's been acting strange ever since .
She cries at night -- something Lynde never did before except when her mother died .
And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed .
"You must find out what was in that letter , Mr. Douglas . ''"
`` Have you any idea who the boy was ? ''
"Alan asked , feeling somewhat relieved ."
"The mystery was clearing up , he thought ."
No doubt it was the old story of some cowardly anonymous letter .
His thoughts flew involuntarily to Isabel King .
Emily shook her head .
`` No .
He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a little . ''
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
`` Would ye lie there idle ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` Let us back into the open .
We have the better chance ; he can not steal upon us unawares . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick ."
"`` My time is come , and peradventure he may pass us by . ''"
"`` Bend me , then , your bow ! ''"
cried the other .
`` What !
will ye be a man ? ''
Dick crossed himself .
`` Would ye have me shoot upon a leper ? ''
he cried .
`` The hand would fail me .
"Nay , now , '' he added -- `` nay , now , let be !"
"With sound men I will fight , but not with ghosts and lepers ."
"Which this is , I wot not ."
"One or other , Heaven be our protection ! ''"
"`` Now , '' said Matcham , `` if this be man 's courage , what a poor thing is man !"
"But sith ye will do naught , let us lie close . ''"
"Then came a single , broken jangle on the bell ."
"`` He hath missed his hold upon the clapper , '' whispered Matcham ."
`` Saints !
how near he is ! ''
But Dick answered never a word ; his teeth were near chattering .
"Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes ; then the leper 's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk , and he seemed narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew ."
"To their stretched senses , the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and the creak of twigs ; and they heard the beating of each other 's heart ."
"Suddenly , with a cry , the leper sprang into the open close by , and ran straight upon the lads ."
"They , shrieking aloud , separated and began to run different ways ."
"But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham , ran him swiftly down , and had him almost instantly a prisoner ."
"The lad gave one scream that echoed high and far over the forest , he had one spasm of struggling , and then all his limbs relaxed , and he fell limp into his captor 's arms ."
Dick heard the cry and turned .
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
"It was red and hot , and now and again it was a little darkened -- as it were , the embers of a bonfire smouldering ."
For the life of me I could not think what it might be .
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing .
"The western end was already steeped in moonshine ; the rest , and the block house itself , still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light ."
"On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady , red reverberation , contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon ."
There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze .
"I stopped , with much wonder in my heart , and perhaps a little terror also ."
"It had not been our way to build great fires ; we were , indeed , by the captain 's orders , somewhat niggardly of firewood , and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent ."
"I stole round by the eastern end , keeping close in shadow , and at a convenient place , where the darkness was thickest , crossed the palisade ."
"To make assurance surer , I got upon my hands and knees and crawled , without a sound , towards the corner of the house ."
"As I drew nearer , my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened ."
"It is not a pleasant noise in itself , and I have often complained of it at other times , but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep ."
"The sea-cry of the watch , that beautiful `` All 's well , '' never fell more reassuringly on my ear ."
"In the meantime , there was no doubt of one thing ; they kept an infamous bad watch ."
"If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them , not a soul would have seen daybreak ."
"That was what it was , thought I , to have the captain wounded ; and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard ."
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."

CHAPTER I
HIS LORDSHIP
Madame Gilbert's war service ended when Austria fell out. She had been
in Italy busied with those obscure intrigues for the confounding of an
"enemy which are excused, and dignified, as patriotic propaganda. She is"
"satisfied that on the Italian Front she, and those who worked with her,"
really won the war.
"The war satisfactorily won, Madame Gilbert sped home to revel in the"
relations between the two thinkers can be gathered only through an
adequate knowledge of both Croce's and Gentile's work.

Wednesday 10:05 A.M.
The limousine had already left the Savoy and was headed down the Strand
"when Alex Novosty broke the silence. He leaned forward, pushed the"
button on the two-way microphone linking the passenger compartment to
"the driver, and spoke in Russian."

be going to Westminster Union. Take us to Moscow Narodny Bank. The

"glanced into his rearview mirror. ""The bank's main office is on King"

"""Just do as you're told."" Novosty cut him off, then killed the mike."
"Under the pink and white,"
Love in her eyes alight;
Love and the Spring and Kensington Gardens:
Hey for the heart’s delight!
REWARDS.
"BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,"
Ah me! how should I understand
That piteous little you were fain
To cry and to be kissed again?
"Because you smiled at last, I thought"
That I had found what I had sought.
"But soon I found, without a doubt,"
No man can find a woman out.
"I kissed your tears, and did not stay"
Till I had kissed them all away.
"Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!"
She would not kiss me when she smiled.

It cries and murmurs in my car

An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the

"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"
A PENSIVE photograph
Watches me from the shelf:
"Ghost of old love, and half"
Ghost of myself!
How the dear waiting eyes
Watch me and love me yet:
"Sad home of memories,"
Her waiting eyes!
"Ghost of old love, wronged ghost,"
"Return, though all the pain"
"Of all once loved, long lost,"
Come back again.
"Forget not, but forgive!"
"Alas, too late I cry."
"We are two ghosts that had their chance to live,"
"And lost it, she and I."
SECOND THOUGHTS.
"WHEN you were here, ah foolish then!"
"I scarcely knew I loved you, dear."
"I know it now, I know it when"
You are no longer here.

A passion that no words can reach;

Our own heart’s speech.

Or mine in hers had read.

GENERAL FOREWORD
AFTER LOVE.
"O TO part now, and, parting now,"
Never to meet again;
"To have done for ever, I and thou,"
"With joy, and so with pain."
"It is too hard, too hard to meet"
"As friends, and love no more;"
Those other meetings were too sweet
That went before.
"And I would have, now love is over,"
"An end to all, an end:"
"I cannot, having been your lover,"
Stoop to become your friend!
ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.
"IF I bid you, you will come,"
"If I bid you, you will go,"
"You are mine, and so I take you"
"To my heart, your home;"
"Well, ah, well I know"
I shall not forsake you.
"To F. V. WHITE, ESQUIRE."
"MY DEAR WHITE,"
The publication of this book is a business arrangement between you and
me. Its dedication however has nothing to do with the relations of
"author and publisher in those capacities, but is merely an expression"
of friendship and esteem. This then is to remind you of pleasant hours
"we have spent together on the other side of the channel, in your house"
"at London, and my house in Kent."
"Yours ever sincerely,"
GUY THORNE.

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
"A frolic Faun that must be hid,"
"Shyly, in some fantastic shade,"
Where pity droops a tender lid
On laughter of itself afraid.
MORBIDEZZA.
"WHITE girl, your flesh is lilies"
"Grown ’neath a frozen moon,"
So still is
The rapture of your swoon
"Of whiteness, snow or lilies."
"The virginal revealment,"
"Your bosom’s wavering slope,"
"Concealment,"
"’Neath fainting heliotrope,"
"Of whitest white’s revealment,"
"Is like a bed of lilies,"
"A jealous-guarded row,"
Whose will is
"Simply chaste dreams:—but oh,"
The alluring scent of lilies!
PASTEL.
THE light of our cigarettes
Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.
"Dark, and then, in the dark,"
"Sudden, a flash, a glow,"
And a hand and a ring I know.
"And then, through the dark, a flush"
"Ruddy and vague, the grace—"
A rose—of her lyric face.
HER EYES.
BENEATH the heaven of her brows’
"Unclouded noon of peace, there lies"
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
In the seclusion of her eyes;
Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
And there’s a little flame that dances
(A firefly in a grassy nest)
In the green circle of her glances;
This volume is dedicated
as a mark of esteem and admiration.

ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.

NOCTURNES.
NOCTURNE.
FANTOCHES.
SCARAMOUCHE waves a threatening hand
"To Pulcinella, and they stand,"
"Two shadows, black against the moon."
The old doctor of Bologna pries
"For simples with impassive eyes,"
And mutters o’er a magic rune.
"The while his daughter, scarce half-dressed,"
"Glides slyly ’neath the trees, in quest"
Of her bold pirate lover’s sail;
"Her pirate from the Spanish main,"
Whose passion thrills her in the pain
Of the loud languorous nightingale.

LES INDOLENTS.
"BAH! spite of Fate, that says us nay,"
"Suppose we die together, eh?"
—A rare conclusion you discover!
"—What’s rare is good. Let us die so,"
Like lovers in Boccaccio.
—Hi! hi! hi! you fantastic lover!
"—Nay, not fantastic. If you will,"
"Fond, surely irreproachable."
"Suppose, then, that we die together?"
"—Good sir, your jests are fitlier told"
Than when you speak of love or gold.
"Why speak at all, in this glad weather?"
"Whereat, behold them once again,"
"Tircis beside his Dorimène,"
"Not far from two blithe rustic rovers,"
For some caprice of idle breath
Deferring a delicious death.
Hi! hi! hi! what fantastic lovers!

REQUIES.
O IS it death or life
That sounds like something strangely known
"In this subsiding out of strife,"
This slow sea-monotone?
"A sound, scarce heard through sleep,"
Murmurous as the August bees
That fill the forest hollows deep
About the roots of trees.
"O is it life or death,"
"O is it hope or memory,"
That quiets all things with this breath
Of the eternal sea?

"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,"
"Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,"
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;
The floating odour that bespeaks
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night
Of alcoves curtained close against the light
"Gracile and creamy white and rose,"
"Complexioned like the flower of dawn,"
Her fleeting colours are as those
"That, from an April sky withdrawn,"
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.
IMPRESSION.
TO M. C.
"THE pink and black of silk and lace,"
Flushed in the rosy-golden glow
Of lamplight on her lifted face;
"Powder and wig, and pink and lace,"
And those pathetic eyes of hers;
name given to each being given also to the corresponding time
"division. Thus we speak of the CAMBRIAN SYSTEM, meaning a certain"
succession of formations which are classified together because of
broad resemblances in their included organisms; and of the
"CAMBRIAN PERIOD, meaning the time during which these rocks were"
deposited.

Three.
"No, no, no."
"3D, super 3D."
Like...
Yeah.

I think you should beta test the full experience we're working on.
"There'd be more money in it, of course."
If you're game?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Uh-huh, I'm game."
I'm game.

I told Regan that was holy water.
I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently.
It's tap water.
What's the difference?
Holy water's blessed.
And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
She killed Burke Dennings.

I think it's geeky.
It's not!
What do you wear?
I hate ugly uniforms.
Is it practiced outside?
Even the UV creams don't help anymore.

He's a plain-clothes brute disguised as an ordinary policeman.
We must get an earlier plane.
Stand guard while I finish packing.

The things you do say.
"That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
- Yes.
Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.
Wait!
Wait.
My ankle.
Don't you think you ought to look at that?
No.
"No, your ankle's all right."
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.
- That stops the circulation.
That's bad.
"- There, you see?"
You did find something.
"You are my doctor, aren't you?"
I have TS.
"Look, uh ..."
Apparently Chan again began distribution.
Muhbirlerimden called me one.
"Chan, followed up to the stadium."

"No, this is not my day."
I have none of that.
"No wife, no children, no one."
You have friends.
- Great friends.
- Mmm-hmm.
"I have no doubt that one day, you will have a wife and child of your own."
Yeah.
"Yeah, one day."

- You're kidding.
Which girls?

Max passed away.
And he was my best friend.
- Did you know about that?
"- Yeah, you told me."
Yeah.

Wait.
Slow down.
All right?

I...
I moved to the countryside.
"In nature, I found myself."
Now I am very strong.
Very strong.
- I see.
Tap.
They are melons.
I trust fruit.
Melons?
And so on.
"Overnight, the king and the angel"
"Have reflected on the matter of watermelons,"
About the future of Europe and the nature of happiness.
And now?
Don't kid around.
That's impossible even if you do that.
I want to get stronger stronger and stronger.
I will become stronger.
Amazing!
Yes!
A comeback!

Twilight:
What?
What is?
Pinkie Pie:
You.
Believing.
I never expected THAT to happen!
"THAT was the doozy, oh and, oh what  a doozy of a doozy it was!"
(Pinkie Pie sings happily)
"(Pinkie Pie and Twilight giggling, Spike opens door)"
Twilight:
"Oh, good, Spike."
You're here.
Take a letter.
Spike:
"With pleasure, Twilight."
Twilight:
"""Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that-"""
"Spike, what have I been saying about focus?"
Spike:
"I know, but I..."
Well...
Twilight:
"What's wrong Spike, never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?"
Spike:
"Not really, no."
Twilight:
[ Stifler ]
Spank me !
Spank me !
"Hit that high ""C."""
[ Falsetto ]
"- Ahhhh - [ Whooping, Laughing ]"
Come on !
What's goin' on here ?
"[ Laughing, Shouting Continue ]"
I was being selfish and majorly insensitive.
I'm a-- I'm a total idiot.
"I mean, a fool, a buffoon."
I think shithead really says it.
You know what ?
You're right.
"I'm a shithead, and I want to make it up to you."
You know what ?
You're right.
"I'm a shithead, and I want to make it up to you."
"Oh, yeah ?"
How ?
- [ Moaning ]
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Ohh ! - - Don't make me -

Shh.
Your parents are downstairs.
"- Kevin, don't stop !"
- Just a second.

"You, fucking how old are you?"
You a student?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
You are sorry?
You bastard.
Don't hit him!
Filthy bastard!
Embarrassing me like this!
- Shut up!
-You shut up!
Filthy bastard.
Fucking bastard.
It's me.
Fox.
Open the door!
Tweetie!

Fox.
A team got caught!
Be quiet.
That policeman is my husband.
Your husband is a cop?!
They're leaving.
Today...
Let's not do it and just get out.
"-You didn't forget anything, right?"
- I'll go through the mountain.
Damn!
What do we do with the beer?
Get in.
You.
- AAAAAAAAAAAAA -

WOHOO!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEEEEEHOO!
Is it really?
Did I leave that here!?
It is completely- DOUBLE pack of cheez doodles.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEAH!
I am so hungry.
The rest is probably just ... garbage.
"Extra spoon, extra primus pump."
So I had two after all.
"Extra funnel, something, extra cover."
OHOHOO!!
WOHO!
OOOOOOOOOOH!
What was I thinking!?
Have I been leaving this here?
"I was probably thinking,- Trying to save weight."
It's not possible.
OHOHOHAHAHA!
WOH-WOHOO!
WOHO!
WOOOooooioi.
My god ... here is mentos.
Ooh!
Here is cheese!?
What the f...
Have I left all the things here that I should have left at the next depot?
My god!
She slowly walked into my room...
Go on...
OK.
And one day...
I saw a woman at a subway.
I was following her secretly.
When I turned the dark corner...
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
"Stop now, you brat."
I've been doing some research.
- Researching?
- Yes.
- Great.
What?
- A new style.
- A new style?
- Indian style.
Indian style?
Sounds fun.
Let's do it.
Do it again!
No good.
What kind of a style is this?
Do it again!
It's stupid...
What a stupid Indian.
- Wait.
- What?
"Sorry, I'm sorry."
That's a little strange.
Tell me a different one.
- Ay!
- Two!
- Ay!

It was absolutely fun!
"It's a relief that your grandfather's phone isn't a video-telephone, isn't it?"
Yes.
But I really feel bad.
I am always scared that grandfather will find out.
It's alright.
It's better for grandfather not to know.
What is it?
Why are you staring?
"Whatever, your personality is bad."
You couldn't do that one thing?
No.
Spike:
How 'bout a squirrel?
Twilight:
No!
Spike:
How 'bout-
Twilight:
NO SMALL RODENTS OF ANY KlND!
Spike:
That's too bad.
Fluttershy:
"A hop, skip, and a...JUMP!"

Amy:
"I don't know, but... it can't be that important."
Matt:
"Alright, go on ahead guys."
I'm going to go powder my nose.
Director General (DG):
No!

Take one more.
You must eat.

"He's the one you were waiting for, right?"
"And see, we brought him for you."

Come!
When did you come?
- Yesterday.
My Lord...
Forgive me...
I am mired in sin.

Just detach the scope module.
Yeah.
Wow.
"Yeah, I would look so cool walking around,"
listening to my iPod with this fucking thing on my head!
"It also advertises that,"
"""Parents will love what they don't hear""."
"It says ""While the LaserScope surrounds the player with the sounds of exciting gameplay action,"""
"""non-players can listen to music, read a book, talk on the phone,"""

Take it off.

Can you believe-- This is definitely one of Stifler's best ideas ever.
[ Jim ]
What is she-- She's touching my stuff.
- Why is she touching my stuff ?
- [ Finch ]
"Man, let her touch."
- She's going through my stuff !
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

Calm down!
Jimmy!
- What's wrong with you?
Easy!
"Take it easy, boy."
- Calm down!
Who's there?
- I'll come now.
"See, what Jimmy has done."
I was afraid of this and it happened.
Few of my men have accompanied me.
Send them upstairs.
I'll manage the rest.
"- Okay, sir."
"Sir, he took those tablets again... ...that doctor had warned him not to take."
"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
I'll wait outside.
- I love you!
- Are going to cry now?
Lower the seat some!
Are those brats following us?
It looks like the car from the errands center from last time.
What.
Hey.
Wait for me
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
- I think my husband might have put a tail on me.
- No.
It's my husband.
Drives me nuts.
- Hey!
This isn't gonna work.
"You, get off here!"
- Here?
There aren't even any buses.
"Get out,Hurry."
"If we get caught together, we're dead."
- How can I get out in this speed?
- Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
"- Uh, no!"
"- Get out, you dick head!"
"Slower, slower."
Get out.
"Yeah, you moron."
I knew it.
You did put a tail on me.
"Yeah, and it wasn't us!"
This couldn't happen from the control room.
Connor:
No one's got access to do that except... except maybe Dr. Niven... but he was down here.
Connor:
The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can sort it out.
Kate:
I...
I don't like it down here.
James:
It's not too far.
(Distant scream)
Amy:
What the hell was that?!
Kate:
Probably a steam valve or something... right?
James:
Probably.
Kate:
How much further is it?
James:
It's not far.
Matt: ...Great.
Matt:
Just as i was starting to get freaked out.
James:
"Look, I'm sorry."
I thought that...
Matt (Interrupting):
Do you know where we're going or don't you?
Amy:
Matt...
How do you mean?
The prince..?
How?
Your Grace.
What?
The Crown Prince?
Yes.
Crown Prince.
Your Grace.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Shall I call for Yuning?
"No, I came to see you."
And how may I be of service?
Go see the Crown Prince.
I'm certain you can convince him.
The Crown Prince.
He's not in.
What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"
Your Grace.
We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack:
Is that a rip? man:
"Why don't you film down there, Jack?"
Let's see if we see a cup.
"Come on, that's it."
Jesus.
"You're not a student now, you know."
You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack:
Yeah.
man:
"Two small beef burgers, believe it or not."
Imagine what the large ones are like or the medium ones.
"Ridiculous, isn't it?"
Unbelievable.
"Anyway, here you go, Jack."
This way.
I'm gonna sit in the car.
[seagulls crying]
What do you got?
Jack:
This. man:
Oh.
Is this bit a photograph of you at uni?
Jack:
Yeah. man:
Fantastic.
Who is it?
- Are you hurt?
No.
- You want something?
Yes.
- What?
TV and Video.
- You want TV and Video?
Why are you looking in the vegetable section?
TV and Video is over there.
Come.
We have to loot his shop.
- Speak softly.
What if he hears?
He is deaf.
Come sir.
"You sit here, and you sit here."
What will you take?
- I don't want anything.
Where did he go?
- I am here.
Why do you always do this?
- Did someone fall again?
"Not there, he fell here."
"I offer a chair, and you make him fall."
"Sorry sir, but he cannot see."
But he is good at his work.
Hello.
"- Not here, do it here."
Hello.
"- Not to the door, here."
Hello.
Ow! man:
Does it hurt?
Sasha:
Yes. man:
It'll sting for a little while.
"There, just dry yourself off."
And let's take a look at the nice...
Sasha:
Meh. man:
Nice clean shave.
"Good job, buddy."
Here.
Sasha:
This is not clean. man:
Here's what we do.
Sasha:
Agh. man:
Don't--give me-- face the camera here.
And we put a little piece on there.
See?
And it sticks to the bloody part.
"And voila, he's done."
"Hey, wait."
"High five, buddy."
You survived it.
[animal bells ring]
man:
"Guys, it's not good to fall in love with girls"
"You have wives, so you are all right."
Whereas I don't have a wife.
Bitch. man:
What day is it today? man #2:
Good luck!
I'm so sorry.
Never mind!
You sing very well.
Really?
You heard it?
"Yes, I did."
- We also saw.
What?
- We saw everything.
What?
He means to say you've got a melodious voice.
Great!
- What?
He means to say you sing so well.
- Oh!
That's great!
You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."
But it's not good to move around freely.
"Yes, I know."
You've got a zero knowledge of music.
I am also a police officer's daughter.
"Every day, they've got only one job."
Arrest!
Attack!
Arrest!
Attack!
Santo!
Helicopter!
I'm sure its my father who must have come to look for me.
Shut up!
"- Joanie, was that you ?"

Oh !

- [ Laughter Continues ]
[ Vicky ]
Kev ?
I think we've come...
- a really long way since homecoming.
"- Yeah, we have."
Maybe it's time... we start to express ourselves in new ways.
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it ?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
It's your turn.
That's not what I was thinking.
Sex.
It's always about sex.
It's not always about sex.
I just thought it was about sex this time.
"Look, Vicky, love is a term that gets thrown around, and-and people don't mean it."
"When I say it, I want it to be more than words."
- You know ?
I want it to be-- - Perfect.
- Is it hot?
- Yes.
It's very good.
Have some.
No.
I'm full!
Drink it.
"If you don't, it'll expire!"
Give one to your father.
"We better finish the pike, too."
One more day and they'll be bugs.
"Hey, Sunghee, come here."
Now what...
"- Have some milk, too."
- I don't want any...
"Yes, you do."
It's going to expire.
I get diarrhea.
Just throw it out!
Brat.
Throw it out?
Why would you throw food out?
Drink up!
Flip over the kimchi that you've eaten!
Flip it over yourself.
It's too bright.
Wait!
- Tell me a story.
-What story?
Any story.
What kind of story?
A racy one?
Yes?
I've done the rest of the accounts.
Thank you.
Have a nice weekend.
You too.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Help!
What are you doing?
I don't want to.
Stop it.
You're hurting me.
Stop it!
What are you doing?
I don't want to.
You're hurting.
Stop it immediately!
- Leave me alone!
- Have you gone crazy?
Let Ricarda go.
Come with me.
Come on.
He... he locked the door.
The pervert!
The perverted bastard!
- That's really awful.
- I didn't do anything.
I can see the state Ms Limmer is in.
I was faster than Rex.
Because you shut the door in his face.
"Strange, that."
Maybe it was the wind.
I didn't tell you...
Amy:
Mum let it slip.
I was waiting for you to tell me.
Kate:
It's nice to finally meet you as well.
Amy:
Are you coming with us?
Kate:
I think so.
James:
Yeah.
Amy:
Ok.
James:
Shall we go?
Connor:
So... why have you thrown your evening away to go on shift?
Kate:
James was going to come meet me for dinner but he told me you guys had to...
Connor:
Oh... sorry.
Kate:
"It's ok, don't worry."
Matt:
And how did James manage to convince you that vending machine food is going to be an acceptable substitute?
Amy:
"Shift can sometimes be boring, are you going to be ok?"
James:
I told her.
Kate:
I insisted.
"I understand the situation, but if you could help..."
Yes...
Just a moment.
Dad.
Don't tell Mom about it.
I heard that his mother has cancer.
"Your dad's a doctor, right?"
- Do you know about cancer?
- Sure.
-What happens if you get it?
- You die.
Everyone with cancer dies.
Why?
Does someone have it?
No...
Mom...
Mom!
"Mom, are you okay?"
Of course!
Why wouldn't I be?
You know how much I wanted to blow this whistle?
"Whenever I see you, I'm full of energy."
"Mom, wait a second."
"Mom, blow the whistle for me."
- Here?
- Yeah.

He's been fucking stabbed!
"- Come on, hurry!"
- Get him on the trolley.
- Fucking hurry up!
- Resus.
Go.
Infuse six units of O-neg.
What'd he say?
He's hanging on.
Trusting lads.
"You always said trusting lads was my problem, Bov."
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.
This is how you prove your point?
Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.
"Just say the word, and I'll do it."
I don't need you for that.
I don't need you for anything anymore.
Go.
Away.
"Bruv, please, I fucked up."
- Shannon.
Shannon.
- You asshole.
I borrowed it from Amy.
Kate:
"Yep, sure."
Matt:
That's a pretty deep film for a lowly engineer like yourself.
James:
(Laughs)
Kate:
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:
(Crowd noise)
James:
So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.
James:
And then we collide them... here.
James:
And then we detect what's made in the collision.
Amy:
(Sighs loudly)
James:
What's up?
Amy:
I thought I'd got it working!
James:
Got... what working?
Connor (off screen):
Her Higgs simulation.
Kate:
Her... what simulation?
Amy:
Look at Kiwi.
-I know.
He's everywhere.
"[laughs, then hiccups]"
Oh.
-We've got to figure out a way to stop them.
"-Oh, no."
They're getting worse by the second.
-[hiccuping]:
Help... me.
"-Hey, uh, Orange?"
"I know we just met and all, but..."
"-We're really sorry this is happening to you, Orange."
You seemed like such a great-- [crashing/crumbling sound]
-What was that?
-I don't know.
It kind of sounded like a--
-Gorilla!
-Huh?
[bananas screaming]
[all screaming]
[gorilla hoots and chomps]
-Whoa!
That guy doesn't monkey around.
[laughs]
-How did that thing get in here?
-Poor boomerangs.
I don't think they'll come back from that one.
[laughs]
"-Okay, we get it."
Enough.
-I wonder why they didn't give him the slip.

You people are living in a disguise.
I'll send you behind bars.
"No, sir."
"No, sir."
Let me go home.
My younger brother... ...is suffering from fever.
I had to do this for his treatment.
I've no support in life.

Even my mother died of hunger.

"Fine, Rajesh!"
lf this is what you want.. then I surrender myself.
"I am sorry, my friend."
I had no other option.
Pinto!
Swings?
Were there swings there?
"You said you are going to the toilet,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;what are you doing?"
I was going now.
"Man Ok, let's eat together later."
Okay.
Aren't you going in?
Where did you go?
You neglected a person dying with pain alone.
Wow!
"What, neglect?"
I left after seeing that you had fallen asleep.
Never mind!
"If I catch a cold, it is all your fault, Stylist Jang."
What?
I even poked his finger for him.
My bag!
Let's resume after a break.
"Everyone, be quiet!"
Be quiet!
Be quiet!
"Yes, Grandpa."
What would I be doing?
We're in training.
"At one, shout."
"At two, action."
Start.
- One!
- Ay!
Two!
Ay!
- One!
What are we going to do?
"Also, exposure causes early onset."
(SMACK!)
Take a hard look at yourself.
I'm slipping.
(BRAP!)
Both of us are.
We must abandon her.
Here?
Now?
(TWEET!)
RAPE!!!
"Handy, right?"
We have to go this very minute.
"Okay, um...I'm on board."
"We'll change our last names, and then we'll call the cops."
"Right, right, right!"
They'll take her into custody.
She's no longer our problem.
I like that.
-Move!
Go!
-What?
GO!
GO!
GO!
"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
"No, no, no, no."
I am an expert in discharge.
Just ask away!
"Nasal, Vaginal, Anal."
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Kornei!
So I can't hold anything but a guitar?
My good men!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
"- Is it time, Danka?"
- He must give us the signal.
- Give me some cartridges.
- There aren't any.
"- Come on, give me a cartridge."
- Give me a cartridge.
Missed!
"The last bullet, Father Philosopher."
Now we'll get it.
Here's how!
Drink!
"Drink, everybody!"
Drink... drink... drink...
THE AVENGERS
"You want to kill me, Ksanka?"
Yaska!
"Hey, Burnashists!"
Quick!
Behind the counter!
"They never stop drinking, and we have to guard them."
"Hi, Kornei!"
Pour me out a drink!
"One more, Mikola, and you... and you..."
Mikola?
Don't touch him.
He's an actor.
"Those eyes so dark, Those eyes so black,"
What the fuck just happened?
Amy:
They looked like... the technician team that were down here.
But why would they that to us?
Amy:
Did you see their faces?
Connor:
"The radiation burns, yeah..."
They shouldn't even be alive.
Matt:
Where you going?
Connor:
The gas won't stop them forever.
Connor:
I found a way out.
"Come on, lets go."
Matt:
What if there's more of them?
Connor: ...Here.
Amy:
Take this.
Matt:
One of these maniacs has a gun?!
Connor:
Think he's been dead a while.
Amy:
What's a security guard doing down here anyway?
Connor:
What is this?
James:
The interlock turns the LHC off if people are in the tunnels.
Amy:
- Let's do it here.
Here?
I don't think it's a good idea.
-Whew!
This is strange.
- Never mind.
Get up.
Aren't you coming?
Where?
Where?
Behind the phone booth?
Supermarket?
No.
Don't cross the street.
Just walk straight.
Don't look back.
Yes.
Keep on walking.
- Hide over there.
Hide - Come closer to the sidewalk.
Lean forward.
Okay go.
"- Now, we don't have to talk through the phone."
"- Oh, Okay."
"- Now, where are we going?"
"-Where?, We are going to kill ourselves."
-What do you mean kill ourselves!
- We must die if we love each other.
-What were you thinking coming here?
- I'm sorry.
No one knows who I am.
Open it.
Stand straight!
Radha!
I kept calling you.
You didn't recognize my voice?
"Come, let's go."
Mohit from Agra.
Hello!
"What happened, Kishan?"
- Nothing.
"Jackie escaped, sir."
We don't know where he has gone.
Kishan!
"What happened, Kishan?"
Kishan!
Blood!
You got injured and you didn't even tell me.
Let me rest for some time.
Please... please help us.
It seems the goon's bullet's has passed through his hand.
There was a heavy bleeding.
For now I've stop his bleeding.
But his pulse is going down.
"Do one thing, my child."
Give him one packet every hour.
Yes.
- Okay.
I'll visit in the evening.
Doctor!
"You've come to the temple, my child."
Trust God.
"Come, I'll drop you."
Kishan!
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
Connor:
Same place as last time.
Amy:
Same place as what?
Connor:
Cracked my skull climbing.
Connor:
They had to put a metal plate in my head.
Amy:
You never told me about that.
Connor:
It was when I went home for a few weeks.
Connor:
After Prague.
Amy:
Oh.
Connor:
I didn't mean it like that.
Connor:
Just give me a minute.
Connor:
And I'll see what I can do with the terminal.
Connor:
Is there anything up there?
James:
"There's a door, it's secure."
There's no one about.
I think we're safe for now.
Connor:
All right.
We'll stay here for a bit.
"I'll try and get through the firewall, see if I can get any help."
"Hey, even the card companies give you three months."
"You can give me three months, can't you?"
Let's meet on Saturday for sure.
Okay?
Saturday!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Is there a forecast for rain today?
Well... the report has just come in.
"Sorry, Soo-jeong."
It'll be clear today too.
"Oh, I see."
I'm right here.
Mom!
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.
- And your homework?
- I did it.
- And the diary?
- Of course.
"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
Not you!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!

"Beat it, punk."

The excessive violence...
"Get lost, bastard!"
"Get a life, you shit."
-What?
"-Wait, wait..."
I delivered the message.

No I didn't!
Keep your nose out of other people's relationships!
"I don't deal with relationships, only break-ups!"
Go!
Beat it!
"Hey, I didn't hear anything."
Get lost!
"You don't get it, do you?"
"You listen to me, god damn it!"

-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?

Let me try to take this one step further.
I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
I won't even write these down --
I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.
"Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number."
"Anyone on our panel, verify the answer."
Just give some indication if it's right.
"A three-digit number, sir, yes?"
Audience:
987.
AB:
"987 squared is 974,169."
(Laughter)
AB:
Yes?
Good.
Another three-digit -- (Applause)
"-- another three-digit number, sir?"
Audience:
"-Wait, let me finish."
- Absolutely not.
No way.
-Why are you so worked up?
- Fools...
Don't I have a say in this?
Forget it.
No.
I have a guy already.
"A blind date is the best present, right?"
Really?
You have a boyfriend?
You do?
"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"
It was a misunderstanding!
The ministry of education requested proper courtesies regarding cell phones.
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
The money has been paid
When did I say that?
Go now I won't fight， I didn't say I would
She's really got the nerve.

She'll crush you to death!
Miss， I give up.

Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...

"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?

Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.

"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."

"Uh,"
Yeah.
"I, I've been to Port Aransas"
"but, it was when I was a child."

Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"

"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"

It is.
"It's just,"
But I don't sleep a whole lot
"and I, you know,"
"at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V"
"and,"
Oh.
"Oh, yes,"
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
"and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,"
Yeah.

Right.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."

Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
Right.
"So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it."
"Yeah,"
"my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at medical school in San Antonio right now."
"Oh, great."
So.
Great.
Yeah.

Hi.
"My name is Lowell,"
"and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, do you want to start"
or should I start?
Go right ahead.
"Okay, um,"
I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in.
"We have, um, three children,"
"and, um, they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
"and I say that's great, why not, you know."
"Oh, my,"
uh-huh.
"Yes,"
"why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,"
"I believe that, uh, we in that category,"
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
"but, we are seasoned minds."
"Oh, yeah,"
you're really ready to learn finally.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen."
"Yeah,"
"it was,"
It was a complete waste of money.
"Yeah,"
"settle down,"
"we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study"
"and, uh we know our limitations."
"Right,"
right.
"We,"
Right
"and, uh,"
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
"At seven,"
yeah.
"We're past, yeah, we're past that age"
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"

Compound NJ2 is a xanthylium yellowish pigment found in wine.
"In model solutions, colorless compounds, such as catechin, can give rise to new types of pigments. The first step is the formation of colorless dimeric compounds consisting of two flavanol units linked by carboxy-methine bridge. This is followed by the formation of xanthylium salt yellowish pigments and their ethylesters, resulting from the dehydration of the colorless dimers, followed by an oxidation process. The loss of a water molecule takes place between two A ring hydroxyl groups of the colorless dimers."

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"". The reason given for this change was that, although its range was very limited, this fish was quite common within that range and did not face any significant threats.

"Among the approximately one million foreign volunteers and conscripts who served in the Wehrmacht during World War II were ethnic Germans, Belgians, Czechs, Dutch, Finns, French, Hungarians, Norwegians, Poles, Portuguese, Swedes, and British, along with people from the Baltic states and the Balkans. At least 47,000 Spaniards served in the Blue Division."
"Some estimates state anywhere between 600,000 and 1,400,000 Soviets (Russians and non-Russians) joined the Wehrmacht forces as ""Hiwis"". (or ""Hilfswillige"") The Ukrainian collaborationist forces were composed of an estimated number of 180,000 volunteers serving with units scattered all over Europe. Russian émigrés and defectors from the Soviet Union formed the Russian Liberation Army or fought as ""Hilfswillige"" within German units of the Wehrmacht primarily on the Eastern Front. Non-Russians from the Soviet Union formed the Ostlegionen (literally ""Eastern Legions""). The ""East Battalions"" comprized a total of 175,000 personnel. These units were all commanded by General Ernst August Köstring. (1876−1953) A lower estimate for the total number of foreign volunteers that served in the entire German armed forces (including the Waffen SS) is 350,000."
