No cos it's concert.
There's going
Oh concert.
to be a concert there.
"All Saints, they were going to have a concert weren't they."
No.
This is at the Rhodes Centre.
The Rhodes Centre.
The concert  at which we've got this stall.
Yeah.
The Traidcraft's  stall.

I mean he kept  he didn't know.
He said to me on the phone he didn't know a great deal cos he was just getting it all together.
"And he said, today he phoned me just as I was going out and I didn't really sort of stop and talk to him very long."
He just asked me what we needed and I said well a table.
We don't really need anything else do we?
Like power supply or
Oh no  quite
something with flashing lights on it!
So what time of the day is that?
It's evening.
seven or eight o'clock.
He told me.
How long does it go on for?
No idea.
He said he'd phone me again you see.
I think if there's a concert there'll be a rush at the beginning and there'll be a rush at the end.
"Possibly a rush at the, at an interval I suppose."
What concert is it then?
I mean
"We came out of the shop, turned left  turned left there, and then turned right."
We're going down this road and John was in front of me  and just as John went past this wagon  it pulled out and there was a car coming the other way.
Eeeeh hit my horn.
Ha  I could have shouted louder.
And he stopped and  luckily there was just enough room for me to slow down and just go between them.
I mean that guy just pulled out in front of me.
Mm.
"Huge, huge lorry."
Oh he  he didn't see you or just didn't ?
Didn't care.
Oh.
He saw me alright cos  like John said I had the headlights on.
Yeah.
Well that's it.
Don't expect anybody else to obey the highway code.
Yeah.
Right?
Did you see them two dirty great big no right turn signs?
What no right turn signs ?
You what?
I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction?
"He said you don't, there's no right turn."
"I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn."
I'd already gone that way twice.
Yeah.
And turned right.
Yeah.
Cos it's a very awkward junction.
Mm.
Thank you mum.

Keep them in the same bits won't you?
Yes
same place but a different angle.
This is
"this is all out of his back window  the views out of upstairs, out of his kitchen window."
All these.
"That's the photos I took of it, yeah  at the palace."
It's only like a little village isn't it?
"It's not a, not a big town."
"Oh it's, well it's three little villages together."
See there's no difference really from the postcards.
Erm there's erm
Mm.
"Yeah, oh yeah."
It's boiling there though.
they're walking round in  er woolly jumpers.
Were they really?
It's about twenty four degrees.
"I was sweltering, I was wearing a t-shirt and they were out you know with jumpers on and all sorts."
They wear pyjamas at night  and all sorts they do.
there's Carbi Resorta and  his village itself is called Viapechio something like that.
I can't really say it.
No.

No way.
"That thing on top of that mattress, the thing that doesn't fit  who's is that?"
Oh theirs.
Dunno.
Belongs to the caravan
Yeah.
"Well that's what I mean, belongs to the caravan."
Why was it stuck on the bed?
Because that is the mattress for the bed that folds away in the sitting room.
Right?
But it seems to me to be a foam thing.
Only ran out a month ago!
Just as well so late I've been waiting for  to come.
"I got some here come in this morning she says, they ran out beginning of September last year."

They didn't catch him
"He had an argument with a kid, two or three years ago"

"And I dare say, like these he said they  they've paid for their caravan, cash!"
So that's close to ten thousand pounds!
And they thought it was an investment!
Where as now they
find it had been better for them to have left their in the bank!
"Didn't say it so many words, but that's what he meant!"
And an investment on ten thousand's about twenty pound a week!
"So it's a lot of money to , I would think."
Perhaps he can
"She said thought, she'll only only let it out about six or eight times through the year!"

"It's er just what's been happening to a lot of folk, sinus trouble."
Do you like nice medicine or do you prefer those?
Don't know.
You're not bothered ?
She'll say that and then give you the
horrible stuff.
in a bottle.
"Er I can put it in, in a bottle or I can give you tablets."
In tablets.
You prefer tablets alright then.
Now this is this quite a common thing after the flu to get a problem.
Most times it's both but it's mainly the the left hand side with Jenny.
The skin from here's swollen right
Mhm.
"across and it's touching that hole in the middle and she's getting all blocked up and the stuff's running all the way down the back of your throat, that right?"
"And you're coughing all night, keeping everybody awake?"
"Aye, she doesn't bother but us in the next room, ah,bother us ."
I suppose
We've still got all day Monday off as well.
True.
"She ain't got all, to rush back for anything, has she?"
No.
This is nice.
Nice.
Mm.
"They're nice, aren't they?"
Now you know why you eat so many of 'em.
"I wanted to get the wholemeal ones, bloody out in Tescos."
"The only thing, their bread's a bit crap in there."
Yeah.
"Never get, you know, as big a selection as I'd like to get  in there."
"But, still beggars can't be choosers, they are cheap, they had loads of offers on them."
Mm.
"Tins of baked beans, fourteen P."
"Do, what do they taste like, though?"
"Well, I should imagine they're just the same as their normal ones, and they've stuck a, a whacking great white label on them, but I mean, you know, perhaps they're of an inferior quality, I don't know."
I haven't tasted them yet.
Julia's had them and she said they were fine.
"Erm, well, rice pudding."
Only
I don't like anything like that.
"I, I wouldn't buy it, but,"
Emily eats it for breakfast.
With jam on it.
Mm.
Why don't you like it?
"Not that I'd ever tried it, but, that sort of thing, semolina, and all that,"
"I hate it, urgh."
"Yoghurt, you like yoghurt, though."
"I, put me in a detention centre because I was shoplifting  and I didn't like it there so I left!"
Tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt!
What is your name?
Sarah.
From London?
Where do you come from?
I come from London.
Oh!
That's very original!
And where do you normally live?
Where are you homeless now?
"I'm, in Manchester at the moment."
I knew you were gonna say Manchester!
How old are?
Have you cut holes in your trousers to put
sixteen.
big triangles of cloth in and turn them into flares  then ?
No!
Not quite!
Do you go begging?
"Well  sometimes, but sometimes I just pickpocket  it's much easier that way."
Have you turned to prostitution as a way of getting money?
"No, I don't think that's a really good idea, it's not safe."
It's not   .
Do you sleep in shop doorways or do you go to a hostel so sometimes?
"Well, I haven't got much money but  well sometimes I do go to hostels, yeah  but, most of the time I just sleep anywhere I can find a shelter."
Bus shelters are quite helpful.
Have you ever thought about going back home?
I was gonna say that!
No.
I don't i if  it would be no point.
But why?
Yes we'd have to check.
erm I should first check.
"Check with them, yeah quite."
"So I I do, you do Tesco."
I'll do the swimming pool.
"I, I, I  would check who actually  is responsible for that"
.
But of course all paper now is
All paper?
All paper.
What about this  chap then?
It's in the library th with his number.
"Well, you ring him but if he, if he gets upset or, or"
Oh I see.
it's it's strange  you can give that as an address.
Any Uttlesford  town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper
Do you have to sort it?
Do you have to take it sorted?
No.
No.
It's just a big skip?
And it says
at Stanstead
Do they then sort it?
the car park
"No, they it's  the council collects it and  in Uttlesford, that's why I said we should get at the same time  an Uttlesford councillor because I would"
"Yes, yeah"
"like to know a, whether their new scheme is only temporary, is about to break down."
Mm.
Or whether they actually get the disposals cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost.
Because the  money they can get for this  mixed paper must be a pittance.
Mm.
Closed!
Well
"Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't"
Well some of them certainly
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now
will definitely
so that's
Yeah.
I don't think that this
"They, they won't they they wouldn't"
can't rescind that!
they wouldn't bring
But I
money on the mining
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
"I mean, there's enough coal  in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!"
Yeah!
"And that could possibly be the only, and ah  I mean it's it's a"
Ah but
"it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on"
Well I've no doubt in twenty
I mean
years time the tories will re-open them
much  it's it's far
at at great cost to us!
Ah but you see
Nothing to stop them!
that  it's
Well
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
"I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad  so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it  and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up"
I know  I know
"Funny way of writing it, but you ca you could write it that way."
Ten X.
Erm  people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Yeah.
And you'd get some sort of shape.
But you'd miss a lot of important points.
Yeah.
Erm if they took it from minus ten to plus ten
Yeah.
you'd see a lot more things of interest and maybe  say oh I'll take it from minus fifteen to plus fifteen.
"But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like?"
When X is gigantic.
Ten times.
"If, if X was a million say, you could forget about a million minus ten, let's just call it a million,"
times ten
Ten.
"minus a million, we'll forget about the ten, just think of the minus a million."
So it's a million times minus a million.
Roughly.
A million times minus a million?
Ah.
Minus.
"What's, okay, let's come down a bit."
What's plus three times minus three?
Three.
What's plus three times plus three?
Nine.
Right.
"And, minus three times minus three?"
Minus nine.
No.
Minus three times minus three?
"Do they,"
Yes.
Oh.
"Mind, it is from  er,what they do is send them through the post, just check 'em, make sure everything's alright, ain't it."
"Did they ask you what you were leaving, and things like that."
No.
No.
Oh.
"I I forget to ask him, to make it"
What.
I don't whether they do  or not.
What.
See a man about a dog.
Oh.
Time he got his scruffy
"If anybody comes June, just say, I have you been in touch with yet, and they'll say no, well, say well,"
"Sasha, do you mind."
You'll have to go with
"Mind you can always say to  you caught me at a bad time, you say, it's supposed to have appointment only, but just say, can you, is there any chance of you coming back."
Yeah.
Yeah.
You put appointment only on board.
"But if you're not too bad, I mean, it don't really matter, does it."
"No, don't say it on board, does it."
"Yeah, they put it on board, if you if you having them by by appointment"
By appointment.
"only, they put it on board."
Stick come in front of that.
"Right, well."
"Oh, shit, we're having"
It's nowt shit.
"Take us as we find us,"
Ooh hell!
No not really
Er
just a bit of cheese  and a bit of  pate.
"You know it seems it awful really that two of those places were   aren't they?all these, all the forest"
Oh God!
fern and
Thanks er
"I mean if somebody did grow a tree  I mean, it must be harder in that kind of area but  but wi with the right will for people  to plant a tree and grow it  it's just as easy"
Ahhh.
as chopping it down!
"Well, you know, I mean with"
Up.
correct management they should be able to  profit from the forests  you know a as well replenish them.
"And so unfortunately, it's the short term that's all they think about!"
"Ah,it's not."
At the end of the day it's just greed and profit to gain
If you want a decent tree to grow
and sod tomorrow!
If you want decent trees it takes a long time to grow them!
"Well the hardwoods, yeah."
"Yeah,"
Mm.
I mean they don't grow overnight do
Yeah.
"But even so, I mean  even that can be managed."
Course it can.
At the moment they just
What is this Ken?
That's  German smoked.
You don't have to light it!
It's rather nice that!
Yeah.
"And a, and a short letter I do don't know whether you said that."
Are you talking about this lot or
Yeah.
or that lot?
Sorry?
Yeah sorry I was also tal we were talking about our own membership
talking about Stortford
Oh right!
and we passed on.
No I think they  I mean
They complain they don't get any information.
My first contacts with Friends of the Earth  in this region sort of what six years ago was Harlow.
Mm.
And they were all enthusiastic and  confident and
Well what happened to them?
And  when  there was another friend who was still over here at that time.
And we went three times and they always planned and planned and planned and had ideas what they could do.
And they never pulled round to actually doing it
No.
properly.
Right.
And I think the same happened as with us.
They wrote letters and they did didn't have the energy
Mm.
"to  write again and again you know  And you never get a positive answer, clear answer first, first time round do you?"
Mm.
You have to write and and write more details or put more pressure on and have more people write.
But if you just write a single letter
Yeah but you should .
I know you two have been
Yeah.
Two ounces as well as all the ginger?
"And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes  and then  you get  Philadelphia cheese and white wine  melt it down in the wine"
Mm mm!
"stirring a bit more  you know, crushed root ginger"
Mm mm.
and that's your sauce to serve on the side.
"I tell, you've never eaten anything like it!"
Is it nice?
I could eat the tail.
Really?
It's gorgeous.
"But i , I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive!"
"I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound."
"No, not really."
"It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be."
It's got more and more popular strangely enough.
But she does ginger tea.
Oops.
So do I?
Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before.
Well I'll make you ginger tea.
Well we never tried that before.
"But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo , and you  mix two"
A pound of Philadelphia cheese.
Yeah.
But she does about two pound of root ginger.
Most normal people would have half a pound at the most.
That's two good roots.
You crush it or do you chop
"Two whole, bash it."
it up?
Bash it?
So you're saying it's better on the streets than at home?
Yeah.
Is it worse
You're giving up before you've even tried!
Do you think you should try?
What is the point in trying?
Because you might find out it works and then you wouldn't have
But my mother wouldn't care about me!
How do you know that?
How can you be so sure?
Cos she beats me up!
Fine!
Can't say anything to that!
Well that could just be a sort of way of life.
"I mean, when people get beaten up when they're younger it me"
"this is true, I saw it on a T V programme"
Carry on.
they can erm  it can affect them in their later life and they hit out at people to show their affection.
Mm!
Don't believe that!
She never said a nice word to me in my life!
Haven't you got any other relatives where you could go?
"No, I wouldn't go near them!"
They're all snotty nosed little
Mm.
Don't you
But not
think you're being a little thoroughly class conscious?
No.
"I think you've got some, some attitude problems!"
"They don't care about me , so why should I care about them!"
"Yes, I think you've got a serious attitude problem!"
"But like I said, it  it's just, it's gonna get moved like, no cost to you like, you know what I mean?"
It's er
Yeah.
But an advantage to them!
Is that what you mean?
"But if something went wrong then, this caravan was burnt  that's the end of it!"
They  might just take those down.
"Well i , cos the co , the insurance wouldn't cover it?"
Cos they have got these records   will have these records.
"No, you'll have a certificate then, and all, saying that the caravan covered, it'll be tested every year then."
So it isn't going to be used this week?
"But, no"
You know?
not this week.
"No, not this week."
So we shall lose our insurance?
"like that, yeah."
innit?
"See that man and woman that , yeah?"
Did you see these people in there?
What people?
A man and a woman.
There was two people sitting there.
They've just gone out.
No.
After you came.
"Well they've, they bought a  a caravan down here, a brand new one!"
Yeah.
And they bought it last summer  and they've had trouble ever since!
And they're going around asking people what !
What's up with their's then?
Well they've had to move the caravan !
I shall mar all of that he has made and foraged.
This way!
This way!
Why?
Who am I then my love?
Who am I?
"I'll tell you, since you know about yourself."
Did you know ?
Yes she belongs to time not long past.
The good honest  that kept your master's worship house when he requires .
Will you please go out?
Since  translated so that I'll be the Captain.
By your needs such as those .
With the amount of my money all this must  .
.
"Okay, we'll sto stop there."
Now  even in that had a fairly dry reading through.
"Are there any things you want to add to that list, just looking at that?"
"Di different language and er, and what's going on."
Yeah.
In  I think  the people were speaking faster.
Alright.
"You, looking through it and almost laughing at the ."
Right.
"I think that  almost , we've got another  aspect of  erm   comedy, comedy  it's really on the basis of arguments, fighting  complication between people."
"Which, as you quite rightly say  you really need to hear, hear the voices going on."
and I'll get some people
"along the middle in a moment and, and do it."
"Any, any other things?"
Did anybody snigger on anything
No.
in those thirty lines?
I mean we don't need to  imply anything there.
There's no new recycling centre nearby  for plastics is there?
So who mentioned this
The what?
talk about  recycling  mention that.
I just remember it from the .
"Now Bejam have become Iceland they haven't done the  plastic bags collection have they like the, a lot of the ."
They haven't got a provision for plastic bags
Is that worth checking out?
I know a lot of the Iceland  do have a  recycling
"I I'll do that, if I'm doing plastic bags at charity shops I'll check"
plastic bag recycling
What's happened to Sainsbury's one p back cos they don't actually
Yes I was yes
they don't actually give you one p any more.
No!
"I think  supposed to, they are supposed to."
I I always make them give me three p
"This  in the Friend of the Earth, Germany  she stayed with us, I really would have liked you to meet her."
She was fanatic!
You have cat f food in tins!
How dare you!you know .
What do they
from the butcher and
"Oh, really."
"Locally, no transport."
Cut out  transport.
Only local foods and
If it's available.
Yes well mm.
"So who, who."
Are you doing the bottle bank ?
a lot of our clients
"But on a bigger job you can, you can put the resource in can't you?"
Yeah.
"But a lot of our client's finance sections, don't see the difference between a big and a little job they see some pigeon holes in their spreadsheet and they want to put something in there."
Anything.
"And th they, they've got this sort of"
But this is where we need to talk to the client
Yes.
Of course they are.
isn't it?
"J j just agree with client he might, might be  prepared to accept on a quarterly basis"
Yeah.
you know?
I mean we don't necessarily have to give him it every month.
One could argue
Yeah.
if we're not careful we'll be causing him work.
Oh.
know what they want half of them anyway when they're
Ah.
Let us halt it there.
the customers.
Yeah.
As er I said before.
"Let us sit down, Trev, and see what is sensible"
for us to provide them with.
"Go and talk to them and say look, this is what we can provide to you."
It will be meaningful.
Is that good enough?
"And the chances are they'll say, bloody hell, that's marvellous."
Because what they're getting now is nothing.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
auth authority from the project manager.
"But there may be, there may be"
I think we're discussing two issues here.
"Can we, can we bottom the V O"
Yeah.
one as a start .
"I don't see there's a problem with the V O one, because"
It's
"nobody nobody can issue V Os unless they're delegated to do so, in, in the letter that's signed by me."
I rely on you gentlemen
"And, and they have got the permission of the project manager to spend that money."
Yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
I rely on you gentlemen to make sure
Too right.
"that the people who are delegated, are competent to discharge those duties."
Yeah.
"An and I must admit that I wouldn't, I would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than M S one level."
"Because I just don't think they i they're competent to do the duties of the engineer's representative, because you need a knowledge of the contract."
Tt.
Well.
"There are some jobs that, that we get involved with  are very very small"
We've had John  on
Yeah.
John  's been on jobs and he's er
Well.
"He's been as the R E, which is reasonable to be fair."
Yeah.
So's Steve
Well maybe sometimes it's not their fault.
Most of the time people don't want to be
Yeah.
on the street.
But how do you know that?
"I mean, how could you be so sure it isn't their fault?"
They tell us.
Well those people out on the streets tell me that all the time.
"I mean, have you seen the reports?"
Of course I've seen the reports!
I'm not blind!
"Well the majority of them are a , abused or get thrown out of mental centres, I mean, some of them just run away from home because they want to  and that's only a minority, lots of them have"
I mean
very good reasons!
Well it's still not my problem is it?
Yeah!
It's everybody's problem!
Stop voting Conservative you stupid old bag!
"Yeah , and if you vote for"
There's nothing wrong with being Conservative!
"I i if Labour ca party came in the unemployment would be, unemployment, homelessness would be"
Have you got a family?
even worse!
Of course I've got a family!
How large?
If you don't mind me asking?
I have three children!
How old are they?
And have any of them contemplated running away?
Well how do I know!
I would !
"There's  one's fourteen, one's sixteen, and one's nineteen."
any financial commitment.
And it doesn't change the contract.
So I mean
B t t
"The reason why, no, the reason why these, these"
but they do.
procedures were written is because in the past we had that foggy situation
Mm.
Mm.
"and I wanted to clarify that, and make sure that our procedures actually were back to back with contract procedure."
"So I think in terms o of this particular erm procedure, we're okay."
Mm.
"Where, where we're not okay is in the point that Jim has raised, the general point and that is, what do we mean, what do we d define as a project engineer?"
So junior junior R Es then will not issue V Os.
Unless they're delegated t to do so within the contract and I rely on you to make sure that whoever is delegated to issue
"What if they're,wh what if they're below M S two level?"
No no.
No R E will issue a V O.
They might do if they're M S two I mean  the project engineer
If it's the project engineer.
Yes.
Yeah.
Fine.
specifications here Trevor?
With regards to?
On one two or
Yeah.
three?does it use the word th the term
No.
project engineer?
Definitely
not in the erm er in the M S ones.
That's just it.
"If we're to be, if we end up being audited on that, then we will fail the audit because we do not do that."
That's what I'm saying.
That is supposed to say what we do and what I'm saying is
Yeah.
we don't do that.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it I'm saying we don't do it.
Well I'll leave that for you to manage.
"And, and procedures procedures should not say what we don't do."
"I, I agree with you."
They should say what we do do.
Or .
Or what we ought to do.
Yes.
Oh no.
No.
No.
Ah!
If if we're not complying with the procedures that's a different
"Well it, I mean if we go down that"
a different ball game.
path er Jim then we're gonna have er five or six set different volumes of procedures.
Yes.
Because we all do things slightly different at present.
If that is necessary then that is of course what happened and indeed in many cases that is exactly what happened.
There is nothing wrong
You have a dif
with that.
"But, but, but"
you have a different quality system for different offices.
But Hughie is
"Well you, you have to do in some cases ."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two two
It is.
"It's, it's sort of following the demise of part of er Trevor's empire."
Thus making it even cheaper.
For to a smaller an empire.
"I should use that word, that was used very loosely that word  cheap."
What?
Cheap?
I mean  I'm briefed
on that.
Mm.
Okay.
So the urgent work procedure has now been removed to make life easier.
D two
And to let the client know where the job lies within our organization.
Good.
Given a point of
"Straight into a function and that function head will then s write to the client saying, I've got it."
"My project coordinator is Mr X, and then we've got the point of contact established straight away."
"There are quite a few fairly minor changes to the appointment contract procedure but I haven't, I don't pretend, intend briefing those because I think most people can read."
Right.
"So they should be aware there, there are some."
Yeah.
Right?
Er J two stop zero.
Trainees training report file.
Yes.
"Erm there is a requirement that all trainees and new starters within the group, who are having training reviews undertaken, will maintain a training file."
So they know where to find and we know where to find all their bits of reports and the like.
And the more people that know what good work we do the better.
Provision of photographic services.
Over to you my friend.
Oh.
Provision of photographic services?
Right.
"Erm just to say that, just to confirm the note sent round that erm we will only pay for any photographic services by Intercity East Coast if it has been procured using a task request form in accordance with the same way we procure any other internal B R er service."
Now.
Surely if all we want is prints off existing things all you need do is a request with a DOPACS number?
Yeah.
Surely not you know fill in a task form in for print off a couple of negs.
Is this the external
Yes.
request request for external
Mm?
services?
Well.
B b w w why?
Why can't you just use a task request form that says.
Please p
Well.
I mean
please provide
Prints off the following negative numbers
"four number eight by eight prints off these t off, off negative numbers so and so."
Splendid.
Are you gonna write
And put the DOPACS number on.
You're gonna on something.
Yeah.
Copy it to Andrew  and then Andrew knows when the I B I S invoice comes forward that it's something to be
Then he'll sign it off.
Okay.
"Could I briefly go back to liquidated damages, because there's nothing in the procedure, I think, that says what happens when you send that form to the client, he says, I haven't a clue."
What do you think?
Cos that's exactly what's gonna happen.
Because I've seen
Oh dear.
that form before and they will not know what to put on it or what they
You may be l well be right there.
Maybe  to tell them what liquidated damages
They need leading by the hand gentlemen.
Can't we just put a clause
"We need, we need, no."
They don't.
Organize everyone by us.
Perhaps we should set the course up.
Course up and .
Eh?
Absolutely I like that.
Yeah.
No.
It's very frustrating because I've never never known a client who knew what his losses were.
We'll run a course for project managers.
"As Hugh, Hugh is indicating that th that we have got a degree of expertise and we should be offering that expertise to clients."
Well we can tell him how much we'd be charging them to .
No.
No.
No.
"What we've got to do is say, look, within the terms of the contract"
This is what .
this is what you have to do.
You have to make a genuine pre-estimate of your
losses
So if we're going to do er  I'd better unclip this hadn't I?
Yo
Yes
not one
not once
not one but two
Oh that's awful
Oh dear
You'd thought that these houses could of least put a bit of paint on
Why?
Make it look more attractive
No
They look grotty like that
I still think that you should buy Jean a Range Rover
Why?
"She likes them, nice cars"
I'll buy her a dinky toy one
they're beautiful
"Mm, they might be beautiful but they're difficult to run"
What do you mean difficult to run?
They're a damn sight more efficient than this I'll tell you that for a start
Rubbish
"they take more petrol, but servicing-wise they don't require as much"
Rubbish  they're probably a lot more expensive to run than this
"Well just because this is a Jag H J six convertible, it's neither here nor there"
"Oh, what the whole part of the problem running is, is the depreciation thing, the more, the more you spend on a car the more the more depreciation you're going to get"
Oh I suppose so
I'm not saying I suppose it's better
well this is a classic car as they go
"It's a, it's a, it's a er"
Oh no
What?
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
"`` Well , all our men folk have gone now -- Jem and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl ."
And none of them had to be driven to it .
So we have a right to be proud .
But pride -- '' Susan sighed bitterly -- `` pride is cold company and that there is no gainsaying . ''
"The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west , the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden shadow -- and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki -- the living and the dead -- were in possession of Vimy Ridge ."
Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War .
"`` The British could n't take it and the French could n't take it , '' said a German prisoner to his captors , `` but you Canadians are such fools that you do n't know when a place ca n't be taken ! ''"
So the `` fools '' took it -- and paid the price .
"Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge -- shot in the back , the telegram said ."
"`` Poor Nan , '' said Mrs. Blythe , when the news came ."
She thought of her own happy girlhood at old Green Gables .
There had been no tragedy like this in it .
How the girls of to-day had to suffer !
When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had meant to her .
"John Meredith , too , seemed to have grown old suddenly in them ."
"Faith did not come home ; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her father consent to her going also , but had been told that for her mother 's sake it could not be given ."
"So Di , after a flying visit home , went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport ."
The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley .
Rilla was watching for them .
"Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers ; Walter brought them to her when Jem was gone ; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her ; now , Rilla thought she must take the boys ' place in this ."
"But before she had discovered any , Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays ."
He stalked up the steps of the veranda and laid them on Mrs. Blythe 's lap .
"`` Because Shirley is n't here to bring them , '' he said in his funny , shy , blunt way ."
"`` And you thought of this , you darling , '' said Anne , her lips quivering , as she looked at the stocky , black-browed little chap , standing before her , with his hands thrust into his pockets ."
"`` I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry ` bout you not getting your mayflowers , '' said Bruce seriously , '' 'cause I 'd see to that ."
"And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now , so it wo n't be very long before I 'll be eighteen , and then I 'll go to help him fight , and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place ."
"I wrote Jerry , too ."
"Jerry 's getting better , you know . ''"
`` Is he ?
Have you had any good news about him ? ''
`` Yes .
"Mother had a letter to-day , and it said he was out of danger . ''"
"To put it with brutal frankness , there never was a cockier boy ."
But for the moment Wendy was shocked .
"` You conceit , ' she exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; ` of course I did nothing ! '"
"` You did a little , ' Peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . '"
A little ! '
she replied with hauteur ; ` if I am no use I can at least withdraw ' ; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets .
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot ."
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` do n't withdraw ."
"I ca n't help crowing , Wendy , when I 'm pleased with myself . '"
"Still she would not look up , though she was listening eagerly ."
"` Wendy , ' he continued , in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist , ` Wendy , one girl is more use than twenty boys . '"
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many inches , and she peeped out of the bedclothes ."
"` Do you really think so , Peter ? '"
"` Yes , I do . ' '"
"I think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ' she declared , ` and I 'll get up again ' ; and she sat with him on the side of the bed ."
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked , but Peter did not know what she meant , and he held out his hand expectantly ."
` Surely you know what a kiss is ? '
"she asked , aghast . '"
"I shall know when you give it to me , ' he replied stiffly ; and not to hurt his feelings she gave him a thimble ."
"` Now , ' said he , ` shall I give you a kiss ? '"
"and she replied with a slight primness , ` If you please . '"
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand ; so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain round her neck ."
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to save her life ."
"When people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to ask each other 's age , and so Wendy , who always liked to do the correct thing , asked Peter how old he was ."
"It was not really a happy question to ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what you want to be asked is Kings of England . '"
"I do n't know , ' he replied uneasily , ` but I am quite young . '"
"He really knew nothing about it ; he had merely suspicions , but he said at a venture , ` Wendy , I ran away the day I was born . '"
"Wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner , by a touch on her night-gown , that he could sit nearer her ."
"` It was because I heard father and mother , ' he explained in a low voice , ` talking about what I was to be when I became a man . '"
He was extraordinarily agitated now . '
"I do n't want ever to be a man , ' he said with passion . '"
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun .
"Want of practice , they called it ; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed ."
"Michael believed longer than the other boys , though they jeered at him ; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year ."
"She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland , and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become ; but he never noticed , he had so much to say about himself ."
"She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times , but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind ."
`` Who is Captain Hook ? ''
he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy .
"`` Do n't you remember , '' she asked , amazed , `` how you killed him and saved all our lives ? ''"
"`` I forget them after I kill them , '' he replied carelessly ."
"When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said , `` Who is Tinker Bell ? ''"
"`` O Peter , '' she said , shocked ; but even when she explained he could not remember ."
"`` There are such a lot of them , '' he said ."
`` I expect she is no more . ''
"I expect he was right , for fairies do n't live long , but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them ."
Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter ; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her .
"But he was exactly as fascinating as ever , and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops ."
Next year he did not come for her .
She waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet ; but he never came .
"`` Perhaps he is ill , '' Michael said ."
`` You know he is never ill . ''
"Michael came close to her and whispered , with a shiver , `` Perhaps there is no such person , Wendy ! ''"
and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying .
Peter came next spring cleaning ; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year .
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him .
For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains ; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge .
"But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy ; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman , and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys ."
Wendy was grown up .
You need not be sorry for her .
She was one of the kind that likes to grow up .
In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls .
All the boys were grown up and done for by this time ; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them .
"You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office , each carrying a little bag and an umbrella ."
Michael is an engine-driver -LSB- train engineer -RSB- .
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them .
You are like a tall stately queen .
Your hair is like rippling gold .
"Anthony Pye says it is red , but you need n't pay any attention to Anthony . '' '"
I have only known you for a few months but I can not realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you ... when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it .
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me .
"Besides , it 's the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge ."
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil .
"I owe this all to you , my sweetest teacher . '' '"
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair .
"I shall see you like that for ever , even when we are both old and gray ."
"You will always be young and fair to me , dearest teacher ."
I am thinking of you all the time ... in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight .
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh ... even when you look disdainful .
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I do n't wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it .
I love you in every dress ... you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last . ''
"` Dearest teacher , good night ."
The sun has set and the stars are shining ... stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes .
"I kiss your hands and face , my sweet ."
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm . ''
"`` Your afecksionate pupil , '' ` Annetta Bell . ' ''"
`` This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little .
I knew Annetta could n't have composed it any more than she could fly .
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter .
Annetta cried and ` fessed up freely .
"She said she had never written a letter and she did n't know how to , or what to say , but there was bundle of love letters in her mother 's top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old ` beau . ' ''"
"` It was n't father , ' sobbed Annetta , ` it was someone who was studying for a minister , and so he could write lovely letters , but ma did n't marry him after all ."
She said she could n't make out what he was driving at half the time .
But I thought the letters were sweet and that I 'd just copy things out of them here and there to write you .
I put `` teacher '' where he put `` lady '' and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words .
I put `` dress '' in place of `` mood . ''
I did n't know just what a `` mood '' was but I s ` posed it was something to wear .
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome .
"And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it . ''"
The cheer followed -- that was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood .
"`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cried Long John when the first had subsided ."
And this also was given with a will .
"On the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin ."
"I found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I knew , was a sign that he was agitated ."
"The stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship 's wake ."
"`` Now , Hawkins , '' said the squire , `` you have something to say ."
Speak up . ''
"I did as I was bid , and as short as I could make it , told the whole details of Silver 's conversation ."
"Nobody interrupted me till I was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last ."
"`` Jim , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . ''"
"And they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage ."
"`` Now , captain , '' said the squire , `` you were right , and I was wrong ."
"I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . ''"
"`` No more an ass than I , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according ."
"But this crew , '' he added , `` beats me . ''"
"`` Captain , '' said the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver ."
A very remarkable man . ''
"`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' returned the captain ."
`` But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything .
"I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . ''"
"`` You , sir , are the captain ."
"It is for you to speak , '' says Mr. Trelawney grandly ."
"`` First point , '' began Mr. Smollett ."
"`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back ."
"If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once ."
"Second point , we have time before us -- at least until this treasure 's found ."
"Third point , there are faithful hands ."
"Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it ."
"`` No , it was Laddie , '' said Ernest , refusing to take any credit at all ."
"We hurried home and arrived at Uncle Richard 's about ten , just as they were going to bed ."
"When Uncle Richard heard what had happened , he turned very pale , and murmured , `` Thank God ! ''"
"Aunt Kate got me out of my wet clothes as quickly as possible , put me away to bed in hot blankets and dosed me with ginger tea ."
I slept like a top and felt none the worse for my experience the next morning .
At the breakfast table Uncle Richard scarcely spoke .
"But , just as we finished , he said abruptly to Ernest , `` I 'm not going to sell Laddie ."
"You and the dog saved Ned 's life between you , and no dog who helped do that is ever going to be sold by me ."
Henceforth he belongs to you .
I give him to you for your very own . ''
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"said Ernest , with shining eyes ."
I never saw a boy look so happy .
"As for Laddie , who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest 's knee , I really believe the dog understood , too ."
The look in his eyes was almost human .
Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him .
`` Good dog ! ''
he said .
`` Good dog ! ''
"At Five O'Clock in the Morning Fate , in the guise of Mrs. Emory dropping a milk-can on the platform under his open window , awakened Murray that morning ."
"Had not Mrs. Emory dropped that can , he would have slumbered peacefully until his usual hour for rising -- a late one , be it admitted , for of all the boarders at Sweetbriar Cottage Murray was the most irregular in his habits ."
"`` When a young man , '' Mrs. Emory was wont to remark sagely and a trifle severely , `` prowls about that pond half of the night , a-chasing of things what he calls ` moonlight effecks , ' it ai n't to be wondered at that he 's sleepy in the morning ."
"And it ai n't the convenientest thing , nuther and noways , to keep the breakfast table set till the farm folks are thinking of dinner ."
"But them artist men are not like other people , say what you will , and allowance has to be made for them ."
And I must say that I likes him real well and approves of him every other way . ''
"If Murray had slept late that morning -- well , he shudders yet over that `` if . ''"
"But aforesaid Fate saw to it that he woke when the hour of destiny and the milk-can struck , and having awakened he found he could not go to sleep again ."
It suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen a sunrise on the pond .
Doubtless it would be very lovely down there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour ; he decided to get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight .
He scowled at a letter lying on his dressing table and thrust it into his pocket that it might be out of sight .
He had written it the night before and the writing of it was going to cost him several things -- a prospective million among others .
So it is hardly to be wondered at if the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising .
"said I , waving my cap ."
`` And there 's an end to Captain Silver ! ''
"He watched me keenly and slyly , his chin all the while on his breast ."
"`` I reckon , '' he said at last , `` I reckon , Cap'n Hawkins , you 'll kind of want to get ashore now ."
S'pose we talks . ''
"`` Why , yes , '' says I , `` with all my heart , Mr. Hands ."
Say on . ''
And I went back to my meal with a good appetite .
"`` This man , '' he began , nodding feebly at the corpse '' -- O'Brien were his name , a rank Irelander -- this man and me got the canvas on her , meaning for to sail her back ."
"Well , HE 'S dead now , he is -- as dead as bilge ; and who 's to sail this ship , I do n't see ."
"Without I gives you a hint , you ai n't that man , as far 's I can tell ."
"Now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and I 'll tell you how to sail her , and that 's about square all round , I take it . ''"
"`` I 'll tell you one thing , '' says I : `` I 'm not going back to Captain Kidd 's anchorage ."
I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there . ''
"`` To be sure you did , '' he cried ."
"`` Why , I ai n't sich an infernal lubber after all ."
"I can see , ca n't I ?"
"I 've tried my fling , I have , and I 've lost , and it 's you has the wind of me ."
North Inlet ?
"Why , I have n't no ch ` ice , not I !"
"I 'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock , by thunder !"
So I would . ''
"Well , as it seemed to me , there was some sense in this ."
We struck our bargain on the spot .
"In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island , with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water , when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land ."
"Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest , where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother 's ."
"With this , and with my aid , Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh , and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy , he began to pick up visibly , sat straighter up , spoke louder and clearer , and looked in every way another man ."
The breeze served us admirably .
"We skimmed before it like a bird , the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute ."
"Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low , sandy country , sparsely dotted with dwarf pines , and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north ."
"I was greatly elated with my new command , and pleased with the bright , sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast ."
"I had now plenty of water and good things to eat , and my conscience , which had smitten me hard for my desertion , was quieted by the great conquest I had made ."
"Ragged , dirty , thin , and worn-out he looked ; one foot was bare , the other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt ."
"He seemed to have hidden himself behind the hay-cock , but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him ."
"He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him , and once when he moved , he groaned as if in pain , but still slept on quite spent with weariness ."
"`` He must not lie here , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , and stooping over him she gently called his name ."
"He opened his eyes and looked at her , as if she was a part of his dream , for he smiled and said drowsily , `` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . ''"
"The look , the words , touched her very much , and she put her hand under his head to lift him up , saying in her cordial way , `` I thought you would , and I 'm so glad to see you , Dan . ''"
"He seemed to wake thoroughly then , and started up looking about him as if he suddenly remembered where he was , and doubted even that kind welcome ."
"His face changed , and he said in his old rough way , `` I was going off in the morning ."
"I only stopped to peek in , as I went by . ''"
"`` But why not come in , Dan ?"
Did n't you hear us call you ?
"Teddy saw , and cried for you . ''"
"`` Did n't suppose you 'd let me in , '' he said , fumbling with a little bundle which he had taken up as if going immediately ."
"`` Try and see , '' was all Mrs. Bhaer answered , holding out her hand and pointing to the door , where the light shone hospitably ."
"With a long breath , as if a load was off his mind , Dan took up a stout stick , and began to limp towards the house , but stopped suddenly , to say inquiringly , `` Mr. Bhaer wo n't like it ."
I ran away from Page . ''
"`` He knows it , and was sorry , but it will make no difference ."
Are you lame ? ''
"asked Mrs. Jo , as he limped on again ."
`` Getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it .
"I do n't mind , '' and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him ."
"Mrs. Bhaer helped him into her own room , and , once there , he dropped into a chair , and laid his head back , white and faint with weariness and suffering ."
`` My poor Dan !
"drink this , and then eat a little ; you are at home now , and Mother Bhaer will take good care of you . ''"
"He only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude , as he drank the wine she held to his lips , and then began slowly to eat the food she brought him ."
"Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him , and presently he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him ."
"`` Where have you been , Dan ? ''"
"she asked , beginning to get out some bandages ."
`` I ran off more 'n a month ago .
"Page was good enough , but too strict ."
"I did n't like it , so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in his boat ."
That 's why they could n't tell where I 'd gone .
"It looked strange enough , to see all this wealth in a nest upon a cliff-side , wattled about growing trees ."
"And even then , I thought it seemed deep water for Alan to be riding , who had no better battle-horse than a green purse and a matter of five pounds ."
"The luck , it seems , changed on the second day ."
"About noon I was wakened as usual for dinner , and as usual refused to eat , and was given a dram with some bitter infusion which the barber had prescribed ."
"The sun was shining in at the open door of the Cage , and this dazzled and offended me ."
"Cluny sat at the table , biting the pack of cards ."
"Alan had stooped over the bed , and had his face close to my eyes ; to which , troubled as they were with the fever , it seemed of the most shocking bigness ."
He asked me for a loan of my money .
`` What for ? ''
"said I. `` O , just for a loan , '' said he ."
`` But why ? ''
I repeated .
`` I do n't see . ''
"`` Hut , David ! ''"
"said Alan , `` ye wouldnae grudge me a loan ? ''"
"I would , though , if I had had my senses !"
"But all I thought of then was to get his face away , and I handed him my money ."
"On the morning of the third day , when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage , I awoke with a great relief of spirits , very weak and weary indeed , but seeing things of the right size and with their honest , everyday appearance ."
"I had a mind to eat , moreover , rose from bed of my own movement , and as soon as we had breakfasted , stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside in the top of the wood ."
"It was a grey day with a cool , mild air : and I sat in a dream all morning , only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny 's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports ; for as the coast was at that time clear , you might almost say he held court openly ."
"When I returned , he and Alan had laid the cards aside , and were questioning a gillie ; and the chief turned about and spoke to me in the Gaelic ."
"`` I have no Gaelic , sir , '' said I ."
"Now since the card question , everything I said or did had the power of annoying Cluny ."
"`` Your name has more sense than yourself , then , '' said he angrily , `` for it 's good Gaelic ."
But the point is this .
"My scout reports all clear in the south , and the question is , have ye the strength to go ? ''"
"I saw cards on the table , but no gold ; only a heap of little written papers , and these all on Cluny 's side ."
"Alan , besides , had an odd look , like a man not very well content ; and I began to have a strong misgiving ."
"`` I do not know if I am as well as I should be , '' said I , looking at Alan ; `` but the little money we have has a long way to carry us . ''"
"Alan took his under-lip into his mouth , and looked upon the ground ."
"`` David , '' says he at last , `` I 've lost it ; there 's the naked truth . ''"
`` My money too ? ''
` It 's true I have n't lost a husband -- I have only lost the man who would have been my husband .
I have lost no son -- only the sons and daughters who might have been born to me -- who will never be born to me now . ' ''
"` It is n't ladylike to talk like that , ' said Cousin Sophia in a shocked tone ; and then Gertrude laughed right out , so wildly that Cousin Sophia was really frightened ."
"And when poor tortured Gertrude , unable to endure it any longer , hurried out of the room , Cousin Sophia asked mother if the blow had n't affected Miss Oliver 's mind . '' '"
"I suffered the loss of two good kind partners , ' she said , ` but it did not affect me like that . '"
`` I should think it would n't !
Those poor men must have been thankful to die .
`` I heard Gertrude walking up and down her room most of the night .
She walked like that every night .
But never so long as that night .
And once I heard her give a dreadful sudden little cry as if she had been stabbed .
I could n't sleep for suffering with her ; and I could n't help her .
I thought the night would never end .
But it did ; and then ` joy came in the morning ' as the Bible says .
Only it did n't come exactly in the morning but well along in the afternoon .
The telephone rang and I answered it .
"It was old Mrs. Grant speaking from Charlottetown , and her news was that it was all a mistake -- Robert was n't killed at all ; he had only been slightly wounded in the arm and was safe in the hospital out of harm 's way for a time anyhow ."
They had n't learned yet how the mistake had happened but supposed there must have been another Robert Grant .
`` I hung up the telephone and flew to Rainbow Valley .
I 'm sure I did fly -- I ca n't remember my feet ever touching the ground .
"I met Gertrude on her way home from school in the glade of spruces where we used to play , and I just gasped out the news to her ."
"I ought to have had more sense , of course ."
But I was so crazy with joy and excitement that I never stopped to think .
Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns as if she had been shot .
The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible -- in this respect at least -- for the rest of my life .
I thought I had killed her -- I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman .
It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating .
A pretty time I had !
"I never saw anybody faint before , and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help , because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond ."
"But I knew -- theoretically -- how people in a faint should be treated , and now I know it practically ."
"Luckily the brook was handy , and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life ."
She never said one word about my news and I did n't dare to refer to it again .
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor ."
"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties ."
"` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say ."
"And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose ."
"` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back ."
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
"He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe ."
"However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse ."
"` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '"
And Jose mounted at once .
"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '"
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
"` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '"
Jose listened in surprise .
"He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could ."
"Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf ."
` Look there ! '
"said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle ."
"` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '"
"When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again ."
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '"
"So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak ."
"Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river ."
"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled ."
"` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '"
did he ?
I declare I should n't wonder !
It would be just like the dear old blunder-head . ''
"`` I never thought of it till you told me where Bob was , and then it all sort of burst upon me in one minute ! ''"
"cried Jill , waving her arms about to express the intellectual explosion which had thrown light upon the mystery , like sky-rockets in a dark night ."
`` You are as bright as a button .
"No time to lose ; I 'm off ; '' and off he was , splashing through the mud to post the letter , on the back of which he added , to make the thing sure , `` Hurry up ."
"F.M. '' Both felt rather guilty next day , but enjoyed themselves very much nevertheless , and kept chuckling over the mine they were making under Jack 's unconscious feet ."
"They hardly expected an answer at noon , as the Hill people were not very eager for their mail , but at night Jill was sure of a letter , and to her great delight it came ."
"Jack brought it himself , which added to the fun , and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular `` Youth 's Companion . ''"
"Bob was not a `` complete letter-writer '' by any means , and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle ."
"Not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone , and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way : -- `` Jack did come up Friday ."
Sorry he got into a mess .
"It was real kind of him , and I shall pay him back soon ."
Jack paid Jerry for me and I made him promise not to tell .
Jerry said he 'd come here and make a row if I did n't cash up .
"I was afraid I 'd lose the place if he did , for the Capt. is awful strict ."
"If Jack do n't tell now , I will ."
I ai n't mean .
Glad you wrote .
`` R.O.W. '' `` Hurrah ! ''
"cried Jill , waving the letter over her head in great triumph ."
"`` Call everybody and read it out , '' she added , as Frank snatched it , and ran for his mother , seeing at a glance that the news was good ."
"Jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing `` Pretty Bobby Shafto '' at the top of her voice , to Jack 's great disgust , for he considered the song very personal , as he was rather fond of `` combing down his yellow hair , '' and Jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead ."
"In about five minutes the door flew open and in came Mamma , making straight for bewildered Jack , who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms , saying tenderly , -- `` My good , generous boy !"
I knew he was right all the time ! ''
"while Frank worked his hand up and down like a pump-handle , exclaiming heartily , -- `` You 're a trump , sir , and I 'm proud of you ! ''"
"Jill meantime calling out , in wild delight , -- `` I told you so !"
I told you so !
"I did find out ; ha , ha , I did ! ''"
"`` Come , I say !"
What 's the matter ?
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say `` Mother '' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh , how exquisitely delicious it would be to her ."
That I am afraid is how Peter regarded it .
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
"How proud of him they are ; and very right and proper , too ."
"But why does Peter sit so long on the rail , why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but , on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say `` Peter , '' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"If she said `` Peter '' again , he meant to cry `` Mother '' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when next he peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said `` Peter , '' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , `` Oh , Peter , how exquisitely you play . ''"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
`` Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers ? ''
she said anxiously .
`` I 've just swept the house all over and I ca n't have any more dust tracked in .
The path 's been real muddy since the rain yesterday . ''
"`` Do n't you dare laugh , '' warned Anne in a whisper , as they marched along the newspapers ."
"`` And I implore you , Diana , not to look at me , no matter what she says , or I shall not be able to keep a sober face . ''"
"The papers extended across the hall and into a prim , fleckless parlor ."
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand .
"Mrs. White heard them politely , interrupting only twice , once to chase out an adventurous fly , and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne 's dress ."
"Anne felt wretchedly guilty ; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down ... `` to prevent us from having to go back for it , '' Diana said when they got away ."
Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall .
"`` I 've always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and I 'll believe it after this , '' said Diana , giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe ."
"`` I am glad she has no children , '' said Anne solemnly ."
`` It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had . ''
At the Spencers ' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea .
"Mr. Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall , when it had been built , twenty years before , had n't been built on the site he recommended ."
"Mrs. Esther Bell , who was the picture of health , took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains , and sadly put down fifty cents because she would n't be there that time next year to do it ... no , she would be in her grave ."
"Their worst reception , however , was at Simon Fletcher 's ."
When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window .
But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door .
Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletcher 's .
Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged .
But the tide turned after that .
"Several Sloane homesteads came next , where they got liberal subscriptions , and from that to the end they fared well , with only an occasional snub ."
Their last place of call was at Robert Dickson 's by the pond bridge .
"They stayed to tea here , although they were nearly home , rather than risk offending Mrs. Dickson , who had the reputation of being a very `` touchy '' woman ."
While they were there old Mrs. James White called in .
"`` I 've just been down to Lorenzo 's , '' she announced ."
`` He 's the proudest man in Avonlea this minute .
What do you think ?
"There 's a brand new boy there ... and after seven girls that 's quite an event , I can tell you . ''"
"Anne pricked up her ears , and when they drove away she said ."
"And we could hear him adding to himself , `` Cap'n , is it ?"
"My heart , and here 's promotion ! ''"
Long John answered for himself .
"`` Me , sir ."
"These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir '' -- laying a particular emphasis upon the word `` desertion . ''"
"`` We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it ."
"All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . ''"
"`` My man , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I have not the slightest desire to talk to you ."
"If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all ."
"If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . ''"
"`` That 's enough , cap'n , '' shouted Long John cheerily ."
`` A word from you 's enough .
"I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . ''"
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back .
"Nor was that wonderful , seeing how cavalier had been the captain 's answer ."
But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd .
"Then he advanced to the stockade , threw over his crutch , got a leg up , and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side ."
"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry ; indeed , I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain , who had now seated himself on the threshold , with his elbows on his knees , his head in his hands , and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand ."
"He was whistling `` Come , Lasses and Lads . ''"
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll .
"What with the steepness of the incline , the thick tree stumps , and the soft sand , he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays ."
"But he stuck to it like a man in silence , and at last arrived before the captain , whom he saluted in the handsomest style ."
"He was tricked out in his best ; an immense blue coat , thick with brass buttons , hung as low as to his knees , and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head ."
"`` Here you are , my man , '' said the captain , raising his head ."
`` You had better sit down . ''
"`` You ai n't a-going to let me inside , cap'n ? ''"
complained Long John .
"`` It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . ''"
"`` Why , Silver , '' said the captain , `` if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley ."
It 's your own doing .
"You 're either my ship 's cook -- and then you were treated handsome -- or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! ''"
"`` Well , well , cap'n , '' returned the sea-cook , sitting down as he was bidden on the sand , `` you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all ."
But you look more like your great grandfather West than the MacAllisters .
He died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life . ''
`` Did you see anybody at the store ? ''
"asked Rilla desperately , in the faint hope of directing Susan 's conversation into more agreeable channels ."
"`` Nobody except Mary Vance , '' said Susan , `` and she was stepping round as brisk as the Irishman 's flea . ''"
What terrible similes Susan used !
Would Kenneth think she acquired them from the family !
"`` To hear Mary talk about Miller Douglas you would think he was the only Glen boy who had enlisted , '' Susan went on ."
"`` But of course she always did brag and she has some good qualities I am willing to admit , though I did not think so that time she chased Rilla here through the village with a dried codfish till the poor child fell , heels over head , into the puddle before Carter Flagg 's store . ''"
Rilla went cold all over with wrath and shame .
Were there any more disgraceful scenes in her past that Susan could rake up ?
"As for Ken , he could have howled over Susan 's speeches , but he would not so insult the duenna of his lady , so he sat with a preternaturally solemn face which seemed to poor Rilla a haughty and offended one ."
"`` I paid eleven cents for a bottle of ink tonight , '' complained Susan ."
`` Ink is twice as high as it was last year .
Perhaps it is because Woodrow Wilson has been writing so many notes .
It must cost him considerable .
My cousin Sophia says Woodrow Wilson is not the man she expected him to be -- but then no man ever was .
"Being an old maid , I do not know much about men and have never pretended to , but my cousin Sophia is very hard on them , although she married two of them , which you might think was a fair share ."
"Albert Crawford 's chimney blew down in that big gale we had last week , and when Sophia heard the bricks clattering on the roof she thought it was a Zeppelin raid and went into hysterics ."
And Mrs. Albert Crawford says that of the two things she would have preferred the Zeppelin raid . ''
Rilla sat limply in her chair like one hypnotized .
She knew Susan would stop talking when she was ready to stop and that no earthly power could make her stop any sooner .
"As a rule , she was very fond of Susan but just now she hated her with a deadly hatred ."
It was ten o'clock .
Ken would soon have to go -- the others would soon be home -- and she had not even had a chance to explain to Ken that Fred Arnold filled no blank in her life nor ever could .
Her rainbow castle lay in ruins round her .
Kenneth got up at last .
"He realized that Susan was there to stay as long as he did , and it was a three mile walk to Martin West 's over-harbour ."
"He wondered if Rilla had put Susan up to this , not wanting to be left alone with him , lest he say something Fred Arnold 's sweetheart did not want to hear ."
"Rilla got up , too , and walked silently the length of the veranda with him ."
"They stood there for a moment , Ken on the lower step ."
The step was half sunk into the earth and mint grew thickly about and over its edge .
"` It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit ."
"Either way , he will be out of MY path . '"
"So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance ."
"The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it ."
"` Oh , sire !"
"the Princess Bella-Flor -- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid ."
` What of the Princess Bella-Flor ? '
asked the king impatiently . '
I have heard -- it is whispered at court -- that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' '
"I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly ."
"` Speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? '"
"` It is not I , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ` if your majesty would ask him -- ' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall ."
"` Order Jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when Jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement ."
"` Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment , ' stammered he , ` for if you return without her I will have you drowned ! '"
"And without another word he left the hall , leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror ."
` How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her ? '
thought he .
"` But it is no use staying here , for I shall only be put to death . '"
And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls , and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other , wondering which he should choose , when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach ."
"` Take me , ' it said in a gentle whisper , ` and all will go well . '"
Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk .
Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable .
"He was about to mount on his back , when the animal spoke again : ` Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there , and put them in your pocket . '"
"Jose did as he was told , and being in a great hurry to get away , asked no questions , but swung himself into the saddle ."
"They rode far without meeting any adventures , but at length they came to an ant-hill , and the horse stopped ."
"` Crumble those three loaves for the ants , ' he said ."
But Jose hesitated .
"` Why , we may want them ourselves ! '"
answered he .
` Never mind that ; give them to the ants all the same .
Do not lose a chance of helping others . '
"No captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that ."
"As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what I know ."
But I am responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her .
"I see things going , as I think , not quite right ."
And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth .
And that 's all . ''
"`` Captain Smollett , '' began the doctor with a smile , `` did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?"
"You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable ."
"When you came in here , I 'll stake my wig , you meant more than this . ''"
"`` Doctor , '' said the captain , `` you are smart ."
When I came in here I meant to get discharged .
I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . ''
"`` No more I would , '' cried the squire ."
`` Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce .
"As it is , I have heard you ."
"I will do as you desire , but I think the worse of you . ''"
"`` That 's as you please , sir , '' said the captain ."
`` You 'll find I do my duty . ''
And with that he took his leave .
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` contrary to all my notions , I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . ''"
"`` Silver , if you like , '' cried the squire ; `` but as for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . ''"
"`` Well , '' says the doctor , `` we shall see . ''"
"When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending ."
The new arrangement was quite to my liking .
The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
"It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths ."
"Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house ."
"Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement ."
"Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion ."
"We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore-boat ."
"The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , `` So ho , mates ! ''"
says he .
"Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir ."
"Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat !"
"If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . ''"
"The doctor 's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is ."
The captain looked on for a while in silence .
Then he spoke .
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` I 've given Silver a broadside ."
"I pitched it in red-hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded ."
"We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline ."
"I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . ''"
"Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear ."
"On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five ."
"There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders ."
"In the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged ."
"`` Toss out the fire , '' said the captain ; `` the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . ''"
"The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand ."
`` Hawkins has n't had his breakfast .
"Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , '' continued Captain Smollett ."
"`` Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done ."
"Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . ''"
"And while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence ."
"`` Doctor , you will take the door , '' he resumed ."
"`` See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch ."
"Hunter , take the east side , there ."
"Joyce , you stand by the west , my man ."
"Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is ."
"If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty ."
"Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . ''"
"As the captain had said , the chill was past ."
"As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught ."
Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house .
"Jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety ."
`` No snow . ''
"`` Lawn to rake , then ? ''"
`` Not time for that yet . ''
`` Catalogue of books ? ''
`` Frank got that job . ''
`` Copy those letters for your mother ? ''
`` Take me too long .
"Must have my money Friday , if possible . ''"
"`` I do n't see what we can do , then ."
"It is too early or too late for everything , and you wo n't borrow . ''"
`` Not of you .
"No , nor of any one else , if I can possibly help it ."
"I 've promised to do this myself , and I will ; '' and Jack wagged his head resolutely ."
`` Could n't you do something with the printing-press ?
"Do me some cards , and then , perhaps , the other girls will want some , '' said Jill , as a forlorn hope ."
`` Just the thing !
What a goose I was not to think of it .
I 'll rig the old machine up at once . ''
"And , starting from his seat , Jack dived into the big closet , dragged out the little press , and fell to oiling , dusting , and putting it in order , like one relieved of a great anxiety ."
"`` Give me the types ; I 'll sort them and set up my name , so you can begin as soon as you are ready ."
You know what a help I was when we did the programmes .
"I 'm almost sure the girls will want cards , and I know your mother would like some more tags , '' said Jill , briskly rattling the letters into the different compartments , while Jack inked the rollers and hunted up his big apron , whistling the while with recovered spirits ."
"A dozen neat cards were soon printed , and Jill insisted on paying six cents for them , as earning was not borrowing ."
"A few odd tags were found and done for Mamma , who immediately ordered four dozen at six cents a dozen , though she was not told why there was such a pressing call for money ."
"Jack 's monthly half-dollar had been spent the first week , -- twenty-five cents for a concert , ten paid a fine for keeping a book too long from the library , ten more to have his knife ground , and five in candy , for he dearly loved sweeties , and was under bonds to Mamma not to spend more than five cents a month on these unwholesome temptations ."
"She never asked the boys what they did with their money , but expected them to keep account in the little books she gave them ; and , now and then , they showed the neat pages with pardonable pride , though she often laughed at the queer items ."
"All that evening Jack & Co. worked busily , for when Frank came in he good-naturedly ordered some pale-pink cards for Annette , and ran to the store to choose the right shade , and buy some packages for the young printer also ."
`` What do you suppose he is in such a pucker for ? ''
"whispered Jill , as she set up the new name , to Frank , who sat close by , with one eye on his book and one on her ."
"`` Oh , some notion ."
"He 's a queer chap ; but I guess it is n't much of a scrape , or I should know it ."
"He 's so good-natured he 's always promising to do things for people , and has too much pluck to give up when he finds he ca n't ."
We shall all go .
Selden was a man of his hands ; he was like a brother to me .
"Well , he has gone second ; well , we shall all follow !"
For what said their knave rhyme ?
-- ' A black arrow in each black heart . '
Was it not so it went ?
"Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey gone ; and there lieth poor John Carter , crying , poor sinner , for the priest . ''"
Dick gave ear .
"Out of a low window , hard by where they were talking , groans and murmurs came to his ear ."
`` Lieth he there ? ''
he asked .
"`` Ay , in the second porter 's chamber , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` We could not bear him further , soul and body were so bitterly at odds ."
"At every step we lifted him , he thought to wend ."
"But now , methinks , it is the soul that suffereth ."
"Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' he said , `` here is a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust ."
"Content ye , then ; your business is in careful hands ; justice shall be done you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurts attended ."
"The air is shrewd , and I would not ye took cold upon these scratches . ''"
"He made a sign with his hand ; it was passed down the nave by obsequious servants , who waited there upon his smallest gesture ."
"Instantly , without the church , a tucket sounded shrill , and through the open portal archers and men-at-arms , uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the badge of Lord Risingham , began to file into the church , took Dick and Lawless from those who still detained them , and , closing their files about the prisoners , marched forth again and disappeared ."
"As they were passing , Joanna held both her hands to Dick and cried him her farewell ; and the bridesmaid , nothing downcast by her uncle 's evident displeasure , blew him a kiss , with a `` Keep your heart up , lion-driver ! ''"
that for the first time since the accident called up a smile to the faces of the crowd .
"CHAPTER V -- EARL RISINGHAM Earl Risingham , although by far the most important person then in Shoreby , was poorly lodged in the house of a private gentleman upon the extreme outskirts of the town ."
"Nothing but the armed men at the doors , and the mounted messengers that kept arriving and departing , announced the temporary residence of a great lord ."
"Thus it was that , from lack of space , Dick and Lawless were clapped into the same apartment ."
"`` Well spoken , Master Richard , '' said the outlaw ; `` it was excellently well spoken , and , for my part , I thank you cordially ."
"Here we are in good hands ; we shall be justly tried , and , some time this evening , decently hanged on the same tree . ''"
"`` Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Yet have we a string to our bow , '' returned Lawless ."
"`` Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father 's sake ; and knowing you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . ''"
"`` It may not be , '' said Dick ."
"The sheriff 's officer had run back at the first sound of the shot , to hasten the coming of the soldiers ."
"At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road , and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger ."
"I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses ; for he had no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill , crying out , `` The murderer !"
the murderer ! ''
"So little a time had elapsed , that when I got to the top of the first steepness , and could see some part of the open mountain , the murderer was still moving away at no great distance ."
"He was a big man , in a black coat , with metal buttons , and carried a long fowling-piece ."
`` Here ! ''
I cried .
`` I see him ! ''
"At that the murderer gave a little , quick look over his shoulder , and began to run ."
"The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches ; then he came out again on the upper side , where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes , for that part was again very steep ; and then he dipped behind a shoulder , and I saw him no more ."
"All this time I had been running on my side , and had got a good way up , when a voice cried upon me to stand ."
"I was at the edge of the upper wood , and so now , when I halted and looked back , I saw all the open part of the hill below me ."
"The lawyer and the sheriff 's officer were standing just above the road , crying and waving on me to come back ; and on their left , the red-coats , musket in hand , were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood ."
`` Why should I come back ? ''
I cried .
`` Come you on ! ''
`` Ten pounds if ye take that lad ! ''
cried the lawyer .
`` He 's an accomplice .
He was posted here to hold us in talk . ''
"At that word -LRB- which I could hear quite plainly , though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it -RRB- my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror ."
"Indeed , it is one thing to stand the danger of your life , and quite another to run the peril of both life and character ."
"The thing , besides , had come so suddenly , like thunder out of a clear sky , that I was all amazed and helpless ."
"The soldiers began to spread , some of them to run , and others to put up their pieces and cover me ; and still I stood ."
"`` Jock * in here among the trees , '' said a voice close by ."
* Duck .
"Indeed , I scarce knew what I was doing , but I obeyed ; and as I did so , I heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches ."
"Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing , with a fishing-rod ."
He gave me no salutation ; indeed it was no time for civilities ; only `` Come ! ''
"says he , and set off running along the side of the mountain towards Balachulish ; and I , like a sheep , to follow him ."
Now we ran among the birches ; now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain-side ; now crawling on all fours among the heather .
"`` Why , I am not running Rilla down , '' said Irene , opening her eyes widely ."
`` It was only her lack of feeling I was criticizing .
I suppose she ca n't help it .
"Of course , she 's a born manager -- everyone knows that ."
"She 's very fond of managing , too -- and people like that are very necessary I admit ."
"So do n't look at me as if I 'd said something perfectly dreadful , Betty , please ."
"I 'm quite willing to agree that Rilla Blythe is the embodiment of all the virtues , if that will please you ."
And no doubt it is a virtue to be quite unmoved by things that would crush most people . ''
Some of Irene 's remarks were reported to Rilla ; but they did not hurt her as they would once have done .
"They did n't matter , that was all ."
Life was too big to leave room for pettiness .
She had a pact to keep and a work to do ; and through the long hard days and weeks of that disastrous autumn she was faithful to her task .
"The war news was consistently bad , for Germany marched from victory to victory over poor Rumania ."
"`` Foreigners -- foreigners , '' Susan muttered dubiously ."
"`` Russians or Rumanians or whatever they may be , they are foreigners and you can not tie to them ."
But after Verdun I shall not give up hope .
"And can you tell me , Mrs. Dr. dear , if the Dobruja is a river or a mountain range , or a condition of the atmosphere ? ''"
"The Presidential election in the United States came off in November , and Susan was red-hot over that -- and quite apologetic for her excitement ."
"`` I never thought I would live to see the day when I would be interested in a Yankee election , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
"It only goes to show we can never know what we will come to in this world , and therefore we should not be proud . ''"
"Susan stayed up late on the evening of the eleventh , ostensibly to finish a pair of socks ."
"But she ` phoned down to Carter Flagg 's store at intervals , and when the first report came through that Hughes had been elected she stalked solemnly upstairs to Mrs. Blythe 's room and announced it in a thrilling whisper from the foot of the bed ."
`` I thought if you were not asleep you would be interested in knowing it .
I believe it is for the best .
"Perhaps he will just fall to writing notes , too , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I hope for better things ."
"I never was very partial to whiskers , but one can not have everything . ''"
"When news came in the morning that after all Wilson was re-elected , Susan tacked to catch another breeze of optimism ."
"`` Well , better a fool you know than a fool you do not know , as the old proverb has it , '' she remarked cheerfully ."
"`` Not that I hold Woodrow to be a fool by any means , though by times you would not think he has the sense he was born with ."
"But he is a good letter writer at least , and we do not know if the Hughes man is even that ."
All things being considered I commend the Yankees .
They have shown good sense and I do not mind admitting it .
I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap .
And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten .
"Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair , holding the kitten , and you were standing on a chair at the other side ."
You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled .
You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony .
"Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon , kitten and all ."
If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned .
"I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done , and your mother , who had seen it all from the upstairs window , came down and picked you up , dripping as you were , and gave you a beautiful spanking ."
"Ah , '' said Susan with a sigh , `` those were happy old days at Ingleside . ''"
"`` Must have been , '' said Ken ."
His voice sounded queer and stiff .
Rilla supposed he was hopelessly enraged .
The truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh .
"`` Rilla here , now , '' said Susan , looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel , `` never was much spanked ."
She was a real well-behaved child for the most part .
But her father did spank her once .
"She got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared Alice Clow to see which of them could swallow all the pills first , and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those two children would have been corpses by night ."
"As it was , they were both sick enough shortly after ."
But the doctor spanked Rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards .
"We hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called ` moral persuasion , ' but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing . ''"
Rilla wondered viciously whether Susan meant to relate all the family spankings .
But Susan had finished with the subject and branched off to another cheerful one .
"`` I remember little Tod MacAllister over-harbour killed himself that very way , eating up a whole box of fruitatives because he thought they were candy ."
It was a very sad affair .
"He was , '' said Susan earnestly , `` the very cutest little corpse I ever laid my eyes on ."
"It was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them , but she was well-known to be a heedless creature ."
One day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on .
"So she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined , not to speak of the petticoat ."
Let me see -- would not Tod be some relation of yours ?
Your great grandmother West was a MacAllister .
Her brother Amos was a MacDonaldite in religion .
I am told he used to take the jerks something fearful .
I never expected this !
I must stay with the student . '
"The little fellow thought it over , for he was a sensible Goblin ."
"Then he sighed , ` The student has no jam ! '"
And on that he went down to the grocer again .
"And it was a good thing that he did go back , for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue ."
"It had read everything that was inside it , on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner ."
"But the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings , from that night changed their opinion of the tub , and they looked up to it , and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings , it all came from the tub ."
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs .
"No , as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up , and he had to go and peep through the key-hole ."
"There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm , and he burst into tears ."
"He could not himself say why he wept , but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy ."
"How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student , but that he could not do ; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there !"
"There he stood out on the cold landing , the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor ."
"It was cold -- very cold , but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away ."
Ah !
"then it froze him , and he crept down again into his warm corner ; there it was comfortable and cosy ."
"When Christmas came , and with it the jam with the large lump of butter , ah !"
then the grocer was first with him .
"But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke , hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters -- people hammering from outside ."
The watchman was blowing his horn : a great fire had broken out ; the whole town was in flames .
Was it in the house ?
or was it at a neighbour 's ?
Where was it ?
The alarm increased .
The grocer 's wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something .
The grocer seized his account books .
and the maid her black silk dress .
"Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession ; so did the Goblin , and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student 's room ."
He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour 's house just opposite .
"The Goblin seized the book lying on the table , put it in his red cap , and clasped it with both hands ."
"The best treasure in the house was saved , and he climbed out on to the roof with it -- on to the chimney ."
Rilla felt Carl 's going keenly .
They had always been cronies and playmates .
He was only a little older than she was and they had been children in Rainbow Valley together .
She recalled all their old pranks and escapades as she walked slowly home alone .
"The full moon peeped through the scudding clouds with sudden floods of weird illumination , the telephone wires sang a shrill weird song in the wind , and the tall spikes of withered , grey-headed golden-rod in the fence corners swayed and beckoned wildly to her like groups of old witches weaving unholy spells ."
"On such a night as this , long ago , Carl would come over to Ingleside and whistle her out to the gate ."
"`` Let 's go on a moon-spree , Rilla , '' he would say , and the two of them would scamper off to Rainbow Valley ."
"Rilla had never been afraid of his beetles and bugs , though she drew a hard and fast line at snakes ."
"They used to talk together of almost everything and were teased about each other at school ; but one evening when they were about ten years of age they had solemnly promised , by the old spring in Rainbow Valley , that they would never marry each other ."
"Alice Clow had `` crossed out '' their names on her slate in school that day , and it came out that `` both married . ''"
"They did not like the idea at all , hence the mutual vow in Rainbow Valley ."
There was nothing like an ounce of prevention .
Rilla laughed over the old memory -- and then sighed .
That very day a dispatch from some London paper had contained the cheerful announcement that `` the present moment is the darkest since the war began . ''
"It was dark enough , and Rilla wished desperately that she could do something besides waiting and serving at home , as day after day the Glen boys she had known went away ."
"If she were only a boy , speeding in khaki by Carl 's side to the Western front !"
"She had wished that in a burst of romance when Jem had gone , without , perhaps , really meaning it ."
She meant it now .
"There were moments when waiting at home , in safety and comfort , seemed an unendurable thing ."
The moon burst triumphantly through an especially dark cloud and shadow and silver chased each other in waves over the Glen .
"Rilla remembered one moonlit evening of childhood when she had said to her mother , `` The moon just looks like a sorry , sorry face . ''"
"She thought it looked like that still -- an agonised , care-worn face , as though it looked down on dreadful sights ."
What did it see on the Western front ?
In broken Serbia ?
On shell-swept Gallipoli ?
"`` I am tired , '' Miss Oliver had said that day , in a rare outburst of impatience , `` of this horrible rack of strained emotions , when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it ."
"No , do n't look reproachfully at me , Mrs. Blythe ."
There 's nothing heroic about me today .
I 've slumped .
I wish England had left Belgium to her fate -- I wish Canada had never sent a man -- I wish we 'd tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go .
Oh -- I shall be ashamed of myself in half an hour -- but at this very minute I mean every word of it .
Will the Allies never strike ? ''
"`` Come aboard , Mr. Hands , '' I said ironically ."
"He rolled his eyes round heavily , but he was too far gone to express surprise ."
"All he could do was to utter one word , `` Brandy . ''"
"It occurred to me there was no time to lose , and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck , I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin ."
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy .
All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart .
The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp .
"The bulkheads , all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt , bore a pattern of dirty hands ."
Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship .
"One of the doctor 's medical books lay open on the table , half of the leaves gutted out , I suppose , for pipelights ."
"In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow , obscure and brown as umber ."
"I went into the cellar ; all the barrels were gone , and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away ."
"Certainly , since the mutiny began , not a man of them could ever have been sober ."
"Foraging about , I found a bottle with some brandy left , for Hands ; and for myself I routed out some biscuit , some pickled fruits , a great bunch of raisins , and a piece of cheese ."
"With these I came on deck , put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain 's reach , went forward to the water-breaker , and had a good deep drink of water , and then , and not till then , gave Hands the brandy ."
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth .
"`` Aye , '' said he , `` by thunder , but I wanted some o ' that ! ''"
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat .
`` Much hurt ? ''
I asked him .
"He grunted , or rather , I might say , he barked ."
"`` If that doctor was aboard , '' he said , `` I 'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but I do n't have no manner of luck , you see , and that 's what 's the matter with me ."
"As for that swab , he 's good and dead , he is , '' he added , indicating the man with the red cap ."
`` He war n't no seaman anyhow .
And where mought you have come from ? ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 've come aboard to take possession of this ship , Mr. Hands ; and you 'll please regard me as your captain until further notice . ''"
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing .
"Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks , though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about ."
"`` By the by , '' I continued , `` I ca n't have these colours , Mr. Hands ; and by your leave , I 'll strike 'em ."
Better none than these . ''
"And again dodging the boom , I ran to the colour lines , handed down their cursed black flag , and chucked it overboard ."
`` God save the king ! ''
"It was now his business to seek out the Duke of Gloucester , who alone , in the disorder of the forces , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men ."
"The fighting in the main town was now practically at an end ; and as Dick ran hither and thither , seeking the commander , the streets were thick with wandering soldiers , some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shouting drunk ."
"None of them , when questioned , had the least notion of the duke 's whereabouts ; and , at last , it was by sheer good fortune that Dick found him , where he sat in the saddle directing operations to dislodge the archers from the harbour side ."
"`` Sir Richard Shelton , ye are well found , '' he said ."
"`` I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory ."
"Catesby , if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London ."
"But now , sir , claim your reward . ''"
"`` Freely , my lord , '' said Dick , `` freely and loudly ."
"One hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges , and taken with him one whom I owe love and service ."
"Give me , then , fifty lances , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness is pleased to allow , it shall be clean discharged . ''"
`` How call ye him ? ''
inquired the duke .
"`` Sir Daniel Brackley , '' answered Richard ."
"`` Out upon him , double-face ! ''"
cried Gloucester .
"`` Here is no reward , Sir Richard ; here is fresh service offered , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience ."
"Catesby , get him these lances ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . ''"
"Just then the Yorkist skirmishers carried one of the shoreside taverns , swarming in upon it on three sides , and driving out or taking its defenders ."
"Crookback Dick was pleased to cheer the exploit , and pushing his horse a little nearer , called to see the prisoners ."
"There were four or five of them -- two men of my Lord Shoreby 's and one of Lord Risingham 's among the number , and last , but in Dick 's eyes not least , a tall , shambling , grizzled old shipman , between drunk and sober , and with a dog whimpering and jumping at his heels ."
The young duke passed them for a moment under a severe review .
"`` Good , '' he said ."
`` Hang them . ''
And he turned the other way to watch the progress of the fight .
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` so please you , I have found my reward ."
Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . ''
Gloucester turned and looked the speaker in the face .
"`` Sir Richard , '' he said , `` I make not war with peacock 's feathers , but steel shafts ."
"Those that are mine enemies I slay , and that without excuse or favour ."
"For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that is so torn in pieces , there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party ."
"If , then , I did begin to grant these pardons , I might sheathe my sword . ''"
"`` It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship 's promise , '' replied Dick ."
"`` Come on , Nat , '' he said , and slouched out again ."
"`` Thank you , ma'am , '' added Nat , as he followed him , feeling without quite understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his ungracious friend ."
`` The fellows are having a circus out in the barn ; do n't you want to come and see it ? ''
"he asked , as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn ."
`` Are they big fellows ? ''
said Dan .
`` No ; the big ones are gone fishing . ''
"`` Fire away , then , '' said Dan ."
"Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set , who were disporting themselves among the half-empty lofts ."
"A large circle was marked out with hay on the wide floor , and in the middle stood Demi with a long whip , while Tommy , mounted on the much-enduring Toby , pranced about the circle playing being a monkey ."
"`` You must pay a pin apiece , or you ca n't see the show , '' said Stuffy , who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band , consisting of a pocket-comb blown upon by Ned , and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by Rob ."
"`` He 's company , so I 'll pay for both , '' said Nat , handsomely , as he stuck two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box ."
"With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards , and the performance went on ."
"After the monkey act , Ned gave them a fine specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair , and running up and down ladders , sailor fashion ."
Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity beautiful to behold .
"Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy , and speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground ."
"After this , Tommy proudly advanced to turn a somersault , an accomplishment which he had acquired by painful perseverance , practising in private till every joint of his little frame was black and blue ."
"His feats were received with great applause , and he was about to retire , flushed with pride and a rush of blood to the head , when a scornful voice in the audience was heard to say , `` Ho !"
that ai n't any thing ! ''
"`` Say that again , will you ? ''"
and Tommy bristled up like an angry turkey-cock .
`` Do you want to fight ? ''
"said Dan , promptly descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner ."
"`` No , I do n't ; '' and the candid Thomas retired a step , rather taken aback by the proposition ."
`` Fighting is n't allowed ! ''
"cried the others , much excited ."
"`` You 're a nice lot , '' sneered Dan ."
"`` Come , if you do n't behave , you sha n't stay , '' said Nat , firing up at that insult to his friends ."
"`` I 'd like to see him do better than I did , that 's all , '' observed Tommy , with a swagger ."
"`` Clear the way , then , '' and without the slightest preparation Dan turned three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet ."
"`` You ca n't beat that , Tom ; you always hit your head and tumble flat , '' said Nat , pleased at his friend 's success ."
"Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more somersaults backwards , and a short promenade on the hands , head down , feet up ."
Did you ever see such a rookery ?
And perched right close to the road too .
An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out . ''
"`` I think an old , deserted house is such a sad sight , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old-time joys .
"Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago , and that it was a real pretty place , with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it ."
"It was full of little children and laughter and songs ; and now it is empty , and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind ."
How lonely and sorrowful it must feel !
Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights ... the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs ... and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again . ''
Diana shook her head .
"`` I never imagine things like that about places now , Anne ."
Do n't you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood ?
To this day I ca n't go through that bush comfortably after dark ; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I 'd be frightened to pass it too .
"Besides , those children are n't dead ."
They 're all grown up and doing well ... and one of them is a butcher .
And flowers and songs could n't have ghosts anyhow . ''
Anne smothered a little sigh .
She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades .
But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone .
The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her .
"A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody ; it did not last long , however , and the drive home , through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors , was delightful ."
But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her .
"Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison 's broad , gray-green field of late oats , wet and luxuriant ; and there , standing squarely in the middle of it , up to her sleek sides in the lush growth , and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels , was a Jersey cow !"
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped .
"Not a word said she , but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels , and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened ."
"`` Anne , come back , '' shrieked the latter , as soon as she found her voice ."
`` You 'll ruin your dress in that wet grain ... ruin it .
She does n't hear me !
"Well , she 'll never get that cow out by herself ."
"I must go and help her , of course . ''"
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing .
"Diana hopped briskly down , tied the horse securely to a post , turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders , mounted the fence , and started in pursuit of her frantic friend ."
"Here 's Dan now , full of stories about birds , and bugs , and so on ; let him take care of the museum , and once a week the rest of you take turns to read a composition , or tell about some animal , mineral , or vegetable ."
"We should all like that , and I think it would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads ."
"What do you say , Professor ? ''"
"`` I like it much , and will give the lads all the help I can ."
"But they will need books to read up these new subjects , and we have not many , I fear , '' began Mr. Bhaer , looking much pleased , planning many fine lectures on geology , which he liked ."
`` We should have a library for the special purpose . ''
"`` Is that a useful sort of book , Dan ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , pointing to the volume that lay open by the cabinet ."
"`` Oh , yes !"
it tells all I want to know about insects .
I had it here to see how to fix the butterflies right .
"I covered it , so it is not hurt ; '' and Dan caught it up , fearing the lender might think him careless ."
"`` Give it here a minute ; '' and , pulling out his pencil , Mr. Laurie wrote Dan 's name in it , saying , as he set the book up on one of the corner shelves , where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail , `` There , that is the beginning of the museum library ."
"I 'll hunt up some more books , and Demi shall keep them in order ."
"Where are those jolly little books we used to read , Jo ?"
"` Insect Architecture ' or some such name , all about ants having battles , and bees having queens , and crickets eating holes in our clothes and stealing milk , and larks of that sort . ''"
`` In the garret at home .
"I 'll have them sent out , and we will plunge into Natural History with a will , '' said Mrs. Jo , ready for any thing ."
`` Wo n't it be hard to write about such things ? ''
"asked Nat , who hated compositions ."
"`` At first , perhaps ; but you will soon like it ."
"If you think that hard , how would you like to have this subject given to you , as it was to a girl of thirteen : A conversation between Themistocles , Aristides , and Pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of Delos for the ornamentation of Athens ? ''"
said Mrs. Jo .
"The boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names , and the gentlemen laughed at the absurdity of the lesson ."
`` Did she write it ? ''
"asked Demi , in an awe-stricken tone ."
"`` Yes , but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it , though she was rather a bright child . ''"
"`` I 'd like to have seen it , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Perhaps I can find it for you ; I went to school with her , '' and Mrs. Jo looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was ."
Hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things .
"Wednesday afternoon was appointed for the lectures , as they preferred to call them , for some chose to talk instead of write ."
"Mr. Bhaer promised a portfolio in which the written productions should be kept , and Mrs. Bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure ."
"So when he had freed Wendy , he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others , and himself took her place by the mast , her cloak around him so that he should pass for her ."
Then he took a great breath and crowed .
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin ; and they were panic-stricken .
"Hook tried to hearten them ; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs , and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him ."
"`` Lads , '' he said , ready to cajole or strike as need be , but never quailing for an instant , `` I 've thought it out ."
There 's a Jonah aboard . ''
"`` Ay , '' they snarled , `` a man wi ' a hook . ''"
"`` No , lads , no , it 's the girl ."
Never was luck on a pirate ship wi ' a woman on board .
We 'll right the ship when she 's gone . ''
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint 's .
"`` It 's worth trying , '' they said doubtfully ."
"`` Fling the girl overboard , '' cried Hook ; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak ."
"`` There 's none can save you now , missy , '' Mullins hissed jeeringly ."
"`` There 's one , '' replied the figure ."
`` Who 's that ? ''
`` Peter Pan the avenger ! ''
came the terrible answer ; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak .
"Then they all knew who 't was that had been undoing them in the cabin , and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed ."
In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke .
"At last he cried , `` Cleave him to the brisket ! ''"
but without conviction .
"`` Down , boys , and at them ! ''"
Peter 's voice rang out ; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship .
"Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won ; but the onset came when they were still unstrung , and they ran hither and thither , striking wildly , each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew ."
"Man to man they were the stronger ; but they fought on the defensive only , which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry ."
"Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea ; others hid in dark recesses , where they were found by Slightly , who did not fight , but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces , so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys ."
"There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons , an occasional screech or splash , and Slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven ."
"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook , who seemed to have a charmed life , as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire ."
"They had done for his dogs , but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all ."
"Again and again they closed upon him , and again and again he hewed a clear space ."
"He had lifted up one boy with his hook , and was using him as a buckler -LSB- shield -RSB- , when another , who had just passed his sword through Mullins , sprang into the fray ."
"And for the exposure -- if ye were an ugly hunchback , and the children gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheaper , and an hour of glory worth a life ."
"Howbeit , if ye will , let us ride on and visit the other posts ."
"Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankles in hot blood ."
Him can we trust .
"But mark it , Sir Richard , ye are not yet done ."
The worst is yet to ward .
Sleep not . ''
"He came right up to young Shelton , looking him hard in the eyes , and taking his hand in both of his , gave it so extreme a squeeze that the blood had nearly spurted ."
Dick quailed before his eyes .
"The insane excitement , the courage , and the cruelty that he read therein filled him with dismay about the future ."
"This young duke 's was indeed a gallant spirit , to ride foremost in the ranks of war ; but after the battle , in the days of peace and in the circle of his trusted friends , that mind , it was to be dreaded , would continue to bring forth the fruits of death ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY -LRB- Concluded -RRB- Dick , once more left to his own counsels , began to look about him ."
The arrow-shot had somewhat slackened .
"On all sides the enemy were falling back ; and the greater part of the market-place was now left empty , the snow here trampled into orange mud , there splashed with gore , scattered all over with dead men and horses , and bristling thick with feathered arrows ."
On his own side the loss had been cruel .
"The jaws of the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped with the dead and dying ; and out of the hundred men with whom he had begun the battle , there were not seventy left who could still stand to arms ."
"At the same time , the day was passing ."
"The first reinforcements might be looked for to arrive at any moment ; and the Lancastrians , already shaken by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught , were in an ill temper to support a fresh invader ."
"There was a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking houses ; and this , in the frosty winter sunshine , indicated ten of the forenoon ."
"Dick turned to the man who was at his elbow , a little insignificant archer , binding a cut in his arm ."
"`` It was well fought , '' he said , `` and , by my sooth , they will not charge us twice . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said the little archer , `` ye have fought right well for York , and better for yourself ."
Never hath man in so brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke 's affections .
That he should have entrusted such a post to one he knew not is a marvel .
"But look to your head , Sir Richard !"
"If ye be vanquished -- ay , if ye give way one foot 's breadth -- axe or cord shall punish it ; and I am set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . ''"
Dick looked at the little man in amaze .
`` You ! ''
he cried .
`` And from behind ! ''
"`` It is right so , '' returned the archer ; `` and because I like not the affair I tell it you ."
"Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril ."
Excuse me for a moment . ''
"Rilla flew upstairs , wishing quite frankly that soup tureens had never been invented ."
"But when Jims , at sight of her , lifted his little arms entreatingly and swallowed several sobs , with tears rolling down his cheeks , resentment went out of her heart ."
"After all , the poor darling was frightened ."
She picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed .
Then she essayed to lay him down in his crib .
Jims opened his eyes and shrieked a protest .
This performance was repeated twice .
Rilla grew desperate .
She could n't leave Ken down there alone any longer -- she had been away nearly half an hour already .
"With a resigned air she marched downstairs , carrying Jims , and sat down on the veranda ."
"It was , no doubt , a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary war-baby when your best young man was making his farewell call , but there was nothing else to be done ."
Jims was supremely happy .
He kicked his little pink-soled feet rapturously out under his white nighty and gave one of his rare laughs .
He was beginning to be a very pretty baby ; his golden hair curled in silken ringlets all over his little round head and his eyes were beautiful .
"`` He 's a decorative kiddy all right , is n't he ? ''"
said Ken .
"`` His looks are very well , '' said Rilla , bitterly , as if to imply that they were much the best of him ."
"Jims , being an astute infant , sensed trouble in the atmosphere and realized that it was up to him to clear it away ."
"He turned his face up to Rilla , smiled adorably and said , clearly and beguilingly , `` Will -- Will . ''"
It was the very first time he had spoken a word or tried to speak .
Rilla was so delighted that she forgot her grudge against him .
She forgave him with a hug and kiss .
"Jims , understanding that he was restored to favour , cuddled down against her just where a gleam of light from the lamp in the living-room struck across his hair and turned it into a halo of gold against her breast ."
"Kenneth sat very still and silent , looking at Rilla -- at the delicate , girlish silhouette of her , her long lashes , her dented lip , her adorable chin ."
"In the dim moonlight , as she sat with her head bent a little over Jims , the lamplight glinting on her pearls until they glistened like a slender nimbus , he thought she looked exactly like the Madonna that hung over his mother 's desk at home ."
He carried that picture of her in his heart to the horror of the battlefields of France .
"He had had a strong fancy for Rilla Blythe ever since the night of the Four Winds dance ; but it was when he saw her there , with little Jims in her arms , that he loved her and realized it ."
"And all the while , poor Rilla was sitting , disappointed and humiliated , feeling that her last evening with Ken was spoiled and wondering why things always had to go so contrarily outside of books ."
She felt too absurd to try to talk .
"Evidently Ken was completely disgusted , too , since he was sitting there in such stony silence ."
Hope revived momentarily when Jims went so thoroughly asleep that she thought it would be safe to lay him down on the couch in the living-room .
She even tried to make her heart go softly .
Will they reach the nursery in time ?
"If so , how delightful for them , and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief , but there will be no story ."
"On the other hand , if they are not in time , I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end ."
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them .
"Once again the stars blew the window open , and that smallest star of all called out : ` Cave , Peter ! '"
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose .
"` Come , ' he cried imperiously , and soared out at once into the night , followed by John and Michael and Wendy ."
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late .
The birds were flown .
"-LSB- Illustration : THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN -RSB- CHAPTER IV THE FLIGHT ` Second to the right , and straight on till morning . '"
"That , Peter had told Wendy , was the way to the Neverland ; but even birds , carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners , could not have sighted it with these instructions ."
"Peter , you see , just said anything that came into his head ."
"At first his companions trusted him implicitly , and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy ."
"John and Michael raced , Michael getting a start ."
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room .
Not so long ago .
But how long ago ?
They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously .
John thought it was their second sea and their third night .
"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light , and now they were very cold and again too warm ."
"Did they really feel hungry at times , or were they merely pretending , because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them ?"
"His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them ; then the birds would follow and snatch it back ; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles , parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will ."
"But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter , nor even that there are other ways ."
"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy , they were sleepy ; and that was a danger , for the moment they popped off , down they fell ."
The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny .
` There he goes again ! '
"he would cry gleefully , as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone ."
"` Save him , save him ! '"
"cried Wendy , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below ."
"Eventually Peter would dive through the air , and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea , and it was lovely the way he did it ; but he always waited till the last moment , and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life ."
"Also he was fond of variety , and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him , so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go ."
"I got her through my old friend , Blandly , who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump ."
"The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest , and so , I may say , did everyone in Bristol , as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for -- treasure , I mean ."
"`` Redruth , '' said I , interrupting the letter , `` Dr. Livesey will not like that ."
"The squire has been talking , after all . ''"
"`` Well , who 's a better right ? ''"
growled the gamekeeper .
"`` A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . ''"
"At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on : Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA , and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle ."
There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly .
"They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him , and that he sold it me absurdly high -- the most transparent calumnies ."
"None of them dare , however , to deny the merits of the ship ."
So far there was not a hitch .
"The workpeople , to be sure -- riggers and what not -- were most annoyingly slow ; but time cured that ."
It was the crew that troubled me .
"I wished a round score of men -- in case of natives , buccaneers , or the odious French -- and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required ."
"I was standing on the dock , when , by the merest accident , I fell in talk with him ."
"I found he was an old sailor , kept a public-house , knew all the seafaring men in Bristol , had lost his health ashore , and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again ."
"He had hobbled down there that morning , he said , to get a smell of the salt ."
"I was monstrously touched -- so would you have been -- and , out of pure pity , I engaged him on the spot to be ship 's cook ."
"Long John Silver , he is called , and has lost a leg ; but that I regarded as a recommendation , since he lost it in his country 's service , under the immortal Hawke ."
"He has no pension , Livesey ."
Imagine the abominable age we live in !
"Well , sir , I thought I had only found a cook , but it was a crew I had discovered ."
"Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable -- not pretty to look at , but fellows , by their faces , of the most indomitable spirit ."
I declare we could fight a frigate .
Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged .
He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance .
"I am in the most magnificent health and spirits , eating like a bull , sleeping like a tree , yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan ."
"Seaward , ho !"
Hang the treasure !
It 's the glory of the sea that has turned my head .
"So now , Livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me ."
"Tom , give me one end of a cord here ; I will so truss me this sea-thief , hand and foot together , like a basting turkey -- marry , I will so bind him up -- and thereafter I will so beat -- so beat him ! ''"
"And so he ran on , winding the cord meanwhile about Dick 's limbs with the dexterity peculiar to seamen , and at every turn and cross securing it with a knot , and tightening the whole fabric with a savage pull ."
"When he had done , the lad was a mere package in his hands -- as helpless as the dead ."
"The skipper held him at arm 's length , and laughed aloud ."
"Then he fetched him a stunning buffet on the ear ; and then turned him about , and furiously kicked and kicked him ."
"Anger rose up in Dick 's bosom like a storm ; anger strangled him , and he thought to have died ; but when the sailor , tired of this cruel play , dropped him all his length upon the sand and turned to consult with his companions , he instantly regained command of his temper ."
"Here was a momentary respite ; ere they began again to torture him , he might have found some method to escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure ."
"Presently , sure enough , and while his captors were still discussing what to do with him , he took heart of grace , and , with a pretty steady voice , addressed them ."
"`` My masters , '' he began , `` are ye gone clean foolish ?"
"Here hath Heaven put into your hands as pretty an occasion to grow rich as ever shipman had -- such as ye might make thirty over-sea adventures and not find again -- and , by the mass I what do ye ?"
Beat me ?
-- nay ; so would an angry child !
"But for long-headed tarry-Johns , that fear not fire nor water , and that love gold as they love beef , methinks ye are not wise . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Tom , `` now y ' are trussed ye would cozen us . ''"
`` Cozen you ! ''
repeated Dick .
"`` Nay , if ye be fools , it would be easy ."
"But if ye be shrewd fellows , as I trow ye are , ye can see plainly where your interest lies ."
"When I took your ship from you , we were many , we were well clad and armed ; but now , bethink you a little , who mustered that array ?"
One incontestably that hath much gold .
"And if he , being already rich , continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storms -- bethink you once more -- shall there not be a treasure somewhere hidden ? ''"
`` What meaneth he ? ''
asked one of the men .
"`` Why , if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of vinegary wine , '' continued Dick , `` forget them , for the trash they are ; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the name , that shall , in twelve hours , make or mar you for ever ."
"But take me up from where I lie , and let us go somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon , for I am sore and frozen , and my mouth is half among the snow . ''"
"`` He seeks but to cozen us , '' said Tom , contemptuously ."
`` Cozen !
cozen ! ''
cried the third man .
`` I would I could see the man that could cozen me !
He were a cozener indeed !
"Nay , I was not born yesterday ."
He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion .
Then he went on ticking .
Chapter 15 `` HOOK OR ME THIS TIME '' Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened .
"Thus , to take an instance , we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we do n't know how long , but , say , half an hour ."
Now such an experience had come that night to Peter .
When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready .
"He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it , but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking ."
"At first he thought this eerie , but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down ."
"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion , Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use ; and he decided to tick , so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested ."
"He ticked superbly , but with one unforeseen result ."
"The crocodile was among those who heard the sound , and it followed him , though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost , or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself , will never be certainly known , for , like slaves to a fixed idea , it was a stupid beast ."
"Peter reached the shore without mishap , and went straight on , his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element ."
"Thus many animals pass from land to water , but no other human of whom I know ."
As he swam he had but one thought : `` Hook or me this time . ''
He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it .
"Had he known he would have stopped , for to board the brig by help of the tick , though an ingenious idea , had not occurred to him ."
"On the contrary , he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse ; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him , with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile ."
The crocodile !
No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking .
"At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile , and he looked behind him swiftly ."
"Then he realised that he was doing it himself , and in a flash he understood the situation ."
`` How clever of me ! ''
"he thought at once , and signed to the boys not to burst into applause ."
It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck .
"Now , reader , time what happened by your watch ."
Peter struck true and deep .
John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate 's mouth to stifle the dying groan .
He fell forward .
Four boys caught him to prevent the thud .
"Peter gave the signal , and the carrion was cast overboard ."
"There was a splash , and then silence ."
How long has it taken ?
"It stood wide open ; within , every corner of the pavement was crowded with fugitive burghers , surrounded by their families and laden with the most precious of their possessions , while , at the high altar , priests in full canonicals were imploring the mercy of God ."
"Even as Dick entered , the loud chorus began to thunder in the vaulted roofs ."
"He hurried through the groups of refugees , and came to the door of the stair that led into the steeple ."
And here a tall churchman stepped before him and arrested his advance .
"`` Whither , my son ? ''"
"he asked , severely ."
"`` My father , '' answered Dick , `` I am here upon an errand of expedition ."
Stay me not .
I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . ''
`` For my Lord of Gloucester ? ''
repeated the priest .
"`` Hath , then , the battle gone so sore ? ''"
"`` The battle , father , is at an end , Lancaster clean sped , my Lord of Risingham -- Heaven rest him !"
-- left upon the field .
"And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affairs . ''"
"And thrusting on one side the priest , who seemed stupefied at the news , Dick pushed open the door and rattled up the stairs four at a bound , and without pause or stumble , till he stepped upon the open platform at the top ."
"Shoreby Church tower not only commanded the town , as in a map , but looked far , on both sides , over sea and land ."
"It was now near upon noon ; the day exceeding bright , the snow dazzling ."
"And as Dick looked around him , he could measure the consequences of the battle ."
"A confused , growling uproar reached him from the streets , and now and then , but very rarely , the clash of steel ."
"Not a ship , not so much as a skiff remained in harbour ; but the sea was dotted with sails and row-boats laden with fugitives ."
"On shore , too , the surface of the snowy meadows was broken up with bands of horsemen , some cutting their way towards the borders of the forest , others , who were doubtless of the Yorkist side , stoutly interposing and beating them back upon the town ."
"Over all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fallen men and horses , clearly defined upon the snow ."
"To complete the picture , those of the foot soldiers as had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery combat on the borders of the port , and from the cover of the shoreside taverns ."
"In that quarter , also , one or two houses had been fired , and the smoke towered high in the frosty sunlight , and blew off to sea in voluminous folds ."
"Already close upon the margin of the woods , and somewhat in the line of Holywood , one particular clump of fleeing horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the tower ."
"It was fairly numerous ; in no other quarter of the field did so many Lancastrians still hold together ; thus they had left a wide , discoloured wake upon the snow , and Dick was able to trace them step by step from where they had left the town ."
"While Dick stood watching them , they had gained , unopposed , the first fringe of the leafless forest , and , turning a little from their direction , the sun fell for a moment full on their array , as it was relieved against the dusky wood ."
`` Murrey and blue ! ''
cried Dick .
`` I swear it -- murrey and blue ! ''
The next moment he was descending the stairway .
"Then the tiger called the Raja's son, and when he came the tiger and his wife made him a great many salaams. Then they gave him a good dinner, and he stayed with them for three days. Every day he looked at the tiger's foot, and the third day it was quite healed. Then he said good-bye to the tigers, and the tiger said to him, ""If ever you are in trouble, think of me, and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son rode on and on till he came to a third jungle. Here he found four fakirs whose teacher and master had died, and had left four things, a bed, which carried whoever sat on it whithersoever he wished to go; a bag, that gave its owner whatever he wanted, jewels, food, or clothes; a stone bowl that gave its owner as much water as he wanted, no matter how far he might be from a tank; and a stick and rope, to which its owner had only to say, if any one came to make war on him, ""Stick, beat as many men and soldiers as are here,"" and the stick would beat them and the rope would tie them up."
"The four fakirs were quarrelling over these four things. One said, ""I want this;"" another said, ""You cannot have it, for I want it;"" and so on."
"The Raja's son said to them, ""Do not quarrel for these things. I will shoot four arrows in four different directions. Whichever of you gets to my first arrow, shall have the first thing the bed. Whosoever gets to the second arrow, shall have the second thing the bag. He who gets to the third arrow, shall have the third thing the bowl. And he who gets to the fourth arrow, shall have the last things the stick and rope."" To this they agreed, and the prince shot off his first arrow."
"Away raced the fakirs to get it. When they brought it back to him he shot off the second, and when they had found and brought it to him he shot off his third, and when they had brought him the third he shot off the fourth."
"While they were away looking for the fourth arrow the Raja's son let his horse loose in the jungle, and sat on the bed, taking the bowl, the stick and rope, and the bag with him. Then he said, ""Bed, I wish to go to the Princess Labam's country."" The little bed instantly rose up into the air and began to fly, and it flew and flew till it came to the Princess Labam's country, where it settled on the ground. The Raja's son asked some men he saw, ""Whose country is this?"""
"""The Princess Labam's country,"" they answered. Then the prince went on till he came to a house where he saw an old woman."
"""Who are you?"" she said. ""Where do you come from?"""
"""I come from a far country,"" he said; ""do let me stay with you to-night."""
"""No,"" she answered, ""I cannot let you stay with me; for our king has ordered that men from other countries may not stay in his country. You cannot stay in my house."""
"""You are my aunty,"" said the prince; ""let me remain with you for this one night. You see it is evening, and if I go into the jungle, then the wild beasts will eat me."""
"""Well,"" said the old woman, ""you may stay here to-night; but to-morrow morning you must go away, for if the king hears you have passed the night in my house, he will have me seized and put into prison."""
"Then she took him into her house, and the Raja's son was very glad."
"The old woman began preparing dinner, but he stopped her, ""Aunty,"" he said, ""I will give you food."" He put his hand into his bag, saying, ""Bag, I want some dinner,"" and the bag gave him instantly a delicious dinner, served up on two gold plates. The old woman and the Raja's son then dined together."
"When they had finished eating, the old woman said, ""Now I will fetch some water."""
"""Don't go,"" said the prince. ""You shall have plenty of water directly."" So he took his bowl and said to it, ""Bowl, I want some water,"" and then it filled with water. When it was full, the prince cried out, ""Stop, bowl,"" and the bowl stopped filling. ""See, aunty,"""
"he said, ""with this bowl I can always get as much water as I want."""
"By this time night had come. ""Aunty,"" said the Raja's son, ""why don't you light a lamp?"""
"""There is no need,"" she said. ""Our king has forbidden the people in his country to light any lamps; for, as soon as it is dark, his daughter, the Princess Labam, comes and sits on her roof, and she shines so that she lights up all the country and our houses, and we can see to do our work as if it were day."""
"When it was quite black night the princess got up. She dressed herself in her rich clothes and jewels, and rolled up her hair, and across her head she put a band of diamonds and pearls. Then she shone like the moon, and her beauty made night day. She came out of her room, and sat on the roof of her palace. In the daytime she never came out of her house; she only came out at night. All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it."
"The Raja's son watched the princess quietly, and was very happy. He said to himself, ""How lovely she is!"""
"At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed. ""Bed,"" he said to it, ""I want to go to the Princess Labam's bed-room."" So the little bed carried him to the room where she lay fast asleep."
"The young Raja took his bag and said, ""I want a great deal of betel-leaf,"" and it at once gave him quantities of betel-leaf. This he laid near the princess's bed, and then his little bed carried him back to the old woman's house."
"Next morning all the princess's servants found the betel-leaf, and began to eat it. ""Where did you get all that betel-leaf?"" asked the princess."
"""We found it near your bed,"" answered the servants. Nobody knew the prince had come in the night and put it all there."
"In the morning the old woman came to the Raja's son. ""Now it is morning,"" she said, ""and you must go; for if the king finds out all I have done for you, he will seize me."""
"""I am ill to-day, dear aunty,"" said the prince; ""do let me stay till to-morrow morning."""
"""Good,"" said the old woman. So he stayed, and they took their dinner out of the bag, and the bowl gave them water."
"When night came the princess got up and sat on her roof, and at twelve o'clock, when every one was in bed, she went to her bed-room, and was soon fast asleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed, and it carried him to the princess. He took his bag and said, ""Bag, I want a most lovely shawl."" It gave him a splendid shawl, and he spread it over the princess as she lay asleep. Then he went back to the old woman's house and slept till morning."
"In the morning, when the princess saw the shawl she was delighted."
"""See, mother,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given me this shawl, it is so beautiful."" Her mother was very glad too."
"""Yes, my child,"" she said; ""Khuda must have given you this splendid shawl."""
So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.
"""When you get on these,"" he said, ""you'll come to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he is lord over all the birds of the air."
"Ask him. When you reach his house, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way, and they'll come home of themselves."" So when the King reached the house, he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had said, and away they went home of themselves."
"So he asked again after Whiteland, and the man called all the birds with a blast of his horn, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay; but none of the birds knew. Now, long, long after the rest of the birds came an old eagle, which had been away ten round years, but he couldn't tell any more than the rest."
"""Well, well,"" said the man, ""I'll lend you a pair of snow-shoes, and, when you get them on, they'll carry you to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he's lord of all the fish in the sea; you'd better ask him. But don't forget to turn the toes of the shoes this way."""
"The King was full of thanks, got on the shoes, and when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of the sea, he turned the toes round, and so off they went home like the other pair. After that, he asked again after Whiteland."
"So the man called the fish with a blast, but no fish could tell where it lay. At last came an old pike, which they had great work to call home, he was such a way off. So when they asked him he said:"
"""Know it? I should think I did! I've been cook there ten years, and to-morrow I'm going there again; for now the queen of Whiteland, whose king is away, is going to wed another husband."""
"""Well!"" said the man, ""as this is so, I'll give you a bit of advice."
"Hereabouts, on a moor, stand three brothers, and here they have stood these hundred years, fighting about a hat, a cloak, and a pair of boots. If any one has these three things he can make himself invisible, and wish himself anywhere he pleases. You can tell them you wish to try the things, and, after that, you'll pass judgment between them, whose they shall be."""
"Yes! the King thanked the man, and went and did as he told him."
"""What's all this?"" he said to the brothers. ""Why do you stand here fighting for ever and a day? Just let me try these things, and I'll give judgment whose they shall be."""
"They were very willing to do this; but, as soon as he had got the hat, cloak, and boots, he said:"
"""When we meet next time, I'll tell you my judgment,"" and with these words he wished himself away."
"So as he went along up in the air, he came up with the North wind."
"""Whither away?"" roared the North Wind."
"""To Whiteland,"" said the King; and then he told him all that had befallen him."
"""Ah,"" said the North Wind, ""you go faster than I you do; for you can go straight, while I have to puff and blow round every turn and corner. But when you get there, just place yourself on the stairs by the side of the door, and then I'll come storming in, as though I were going to blow down the whole castle. And then when the prince, who is to have your Queen, comes out to see what's the matter, just you take him by the collar and pitch him out of doors; then I'll look after him, and see if I can't carry him off."""
"Well, the King did as the North Wind said. He took his stand on the stairs, and when the North Wind came, storming and roaring, and took hold of the castle wall, so that it shook again, the prince came out to see what was the matter. But as soon as ever he came, the King caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors, and then the North Wind caught him up and carried him off. So when there was an end of him, the King went into the castle, and at first his Queen didn't know him, he was so wan and thin, through wandering so far and being so woeful; but when he shewed her the ring, she was as glad as glad could be; and so the rightful wedding was held, and the fame of it spread far and wide."
SORIA MORIA CASTLE
"Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor. Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes. His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, but Halvor could stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders."
"Well, one day a skipper came, and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands. Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready."
"How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about."
"Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep."
"""Do you think now you're fit to show yourself before folk,"" said the skipper, ""why, you've no clothes but those rags you stand in?"""
"But Halvor stuck to his own, and so at last he got leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul. Well, it began to blow, but Halvor thought he hadn't seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldn't meet any folk. So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it."
"Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone. So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got."
"In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. It was so grand and fine; there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul. So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel."
"""Nay, nay, now!"" she called out, ""dare Christian folk come hither? But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads."""
"Well, the story soon spread, and came up to the castle; and when the King heard the woman's grief and its cause, he sent down to say he would take care of the child, and see if he couldn't save it."
"So the months went on and on, and when her time came the fisher's wife had a boy; so the king took it at once, and brought it up as his own son, until the lad grew up. Then he begged leave one day to go out fishing with his father; he had such a mind to go, he said. At first the King wouldn't hear of it, but at last the lad had his way, and went. So he and his father were out the whole day, and all went right and well till they landed at night. Then the lad remembered he had left his handkerchief, and went to look for it; but as soon as ever he got into the boat, it began to move off with him at such speed that the water roared under the bow, and all the lad could do in rowing against it with the oars was no use; so he went and went the whole night, and at last he came to a white strand, far far away."
"There he went ashore, and when he had walked about a bit, an old, old man met him, with a long white beard."
"""What's the name of this land?"" asked the lad."
"""Whiteland,"" said the man, who went on to ask the lad whence he came, and what he was going to do. So the lad told him all."
"""Aye, aye!"" said the man; ""now when you have walked a little farther along the strand here, you'll come to three Princesses, whom you will see standing in the earth up to their necks, with only their heads out. Then the first she is the eldest will call out and beg you so prettily to come and help her; and the second will do the same; to neither of these shall you go; make haste past them, as if you neither saw nor heard anything. But the third you shall go to, and do what she asks. If you do this, you'll have good luck that's all."""
"When the lad came to the first Princess, she called out to him, and begged him so prettily to come to her, but he passed on as though he saw her not. In the same way he passed by the second; but to the third he went straight up."
"""If you'll do what I bid you,"" she said, ""you may have which of us you please."""
"""Yes;"" he was willing enough; so she told him how three Trolls had set them down in the earth there; but before they had lived in the castle up among the trees."
"""Now,"" she said, ""you must go into that castle, and let the Trolls whip you each one night for each of us. If you can bear that, you'll set us free."""
"Well, the lad said he was ready to try."
"""When you go in,"" the Princess went on to say, ""you'll see two lions standing at the gate; but if you'll only go right in the middle between them they'll do you no harm. Then go straight on into a little dark room, and make your bed. Then the Troll will come to whip you; but if you take the flask which hangs on the wall, and rub yourself with the ointment that's in it, wherever his lash falls, you'll be as sound as ever. Then grasp the sword that hangs by the side of the flask and strike the Troll dead."""
"Yes, he did as the Princess told him; he passed in the midst between the lions, as if he hadn't seen them, and went straight into the little room, and there he lay down to sleep. The first night there came a Troll with three heads and three rods, and whipped the lad soundly; but he stood it till the Troll was done; then he took the flask and rubbed himself, and grasped the sword and slew the Troll."
"So, when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth up to their waists."
"The next night 'twas the same story over again, only this time the Troll had six heads and six rods, and he whipped him far worse than the first; but when he went out next morning, the Princesses stood out of the earth as far as the knee."
"The third night there came a Troll that had nine heads and nine rods, and he whipped and flogged the lad so long that he fainted away; then the Troll took him up and dashed him against the wall; but the shock brought down the flask, which fell on the lad, burst, and spilled the ointment all over him, and so he became as strong and sound as ever again. Then he wasn't slow; he grasped the sword and slew the Troll; and next morning when he went out of the castle the Princesses stood before him with all their bodies out of the earth."
"So he took the youngest for his Queen, and lived well and happily with her for some time."
At last he began to long to go home for a little to see his parents.
"His Queen did not like this; but at last his heart was so set on it, and he longed and longed so much, there was no holding him back, so she said:"
"""One thing you must promise me. This only to do what your father begs you to do, and not what mother wishes;"" and that he promised."
"Then she gave him a ring, which was of that kind that any one who wore it might wish two wishes. So he wished himself home, and when he got home his parents could not wonder enough what a grand man their son had become."
"Now, when he had been at home some days, his mother wished him to go up to the palace and show the King what a fine fellow he had come to be. But his father said:"
"""No! don't let him do that; if he does, we shan't have any more joy of him this time."""
"But it was no good, the mother begged and prayed so long that at last he went. So when he got up to the palace he was far braver, both in clothes and array, than the other king, who didn't quite like this, and at last he said:"
"""All very fine; but here you can see my Queen, what like she is, but I can't see yours: that I can't. Do you know, I scarce think she's so good-looking as mine."""
"""Would to Heaven,"" said the young King, ""she were standing here, then you'd see what she was like."" And that instant there she stood before them."
"But she was very woeful, and said to him:"
"""Why did you not mind what I told you; and why did you not listen to what your father said? Now, I must away home, and as for you, you have had both your wishes."""
"With that she knitted a ring among his hair with her name on it, and wished herself home, and was off."
"Then the young King was cut to the heart, and went, day out day in, thinking and thinking how he should get back to his Queen. ""I'll just try,"" he thought, ""if I can't learn where Whiteland lies;"" and so he went out into the world to ask. So when he had gone a good way, he came to a high hill, and there he met one who was lord over all the beasts of the wood, for they all came home to him when he blew his horn; so the King asked if he knew where Whiteland was."
"""No, I don't,"" said he, ""but I'll ask my beasts."" Then he blew his horn and called them, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay. But there was no beast that knew."
"When the morning came the old dame was so poorly that she couldn't utter a word but groans and sighs. She was sure she should never be well again, unless she had some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the castle where the man's brothers lived; only she had no one to send for them."
"Oh! the lad was ready to go that instant; but the eleven lions went with him. So when he came to the orchard, he climbed up into the apple tree and ate as many apples as he could, and he had scarce got down before he fell into a deep sleep; but the lions all lay round him in a ring. The third day came the Troll's brothers, but they did not come in man's shape. They came snorting like man-eating steeds, and wondered who it was that dared to be there, and said they would tear him to pieces, so small that there should not be a bit of him left."
"But up rose the lions and tore the Trolls into small pieces, so that the place looked as if a dung heap had been tossed about it; and when they had finished the Trolls they lay down again. The lad did not wake till late in the afternoon, and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he began to wonder what had been going on, when he saw the marks of hoofs. But when he went towards the castle, a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that had happened, and she said:"
"""You may thank your stars you weren't in that tussle, else you must have lost your life."""
"""What! I lose my life! No fear of that, I think,"" said the lad."
"So she begged him to come in, that she might talk with him, for she hadn't seen a Christian soul ever since she came there. But when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too, but she got so frightened that she began to scream, and so the lad let them lie outside. Then the two talked and talked, and the lad asked how it came that she, who was so lovely, could put up with those ugly Trolls. She never wished it, she said; 'twas quite against her will."
"They had seized her by force, and she was the King of Arabia's daughter. So they talked on, and at last she asked him what he would do; whether she should go back home, or whether he would have her to wife. Of course he would have her, and she shouldn't go home."
"After that they went round the castle, and at last they came to a great hall, where the Trolls' two great swords hung high up on the wall."
"""I wonder if you are man enough to wield one of these,"" said the Princess."
"""Who? I?"" said the lad. ""'Twould be a pretty thing if I couldn't wield one of these."""
"With that he put two or three chairs one a-top of the other, jumped up, and touched the biggest sword with his finger tips, tossed it up in the air, and caught it again by the hilt; leapt down, and at the same time dealt such a blow with it on the floor that the whole hall shook. After he had thus got down, he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him."
"So, when they had lived a little while in the castle, the Princess thought she ought to go home to her parents, and let them know what had become of her; so they loaded a ship, and she set sail from the castle."
"After she had gone, and the lad had wandered about a little, he called to mind that he had been sent out on an errand thither, and had come to fetch something for his mother's health; and though he said to himself, ""After all the old dame was not so bad but she's all right by this time"" still he thought he ought to go and just see how she was."
So he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty.
"""What wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut,"" said the lad."
"""Come with me up to my castle, and you shall see what a fine fellow I am."""
"Well! they were both ready to go, and on the way his mother talked to him, and asked how it was he had got so strong."
"""If you must know it came of that blue belt which lay on the hill-side that time when you and I were out begging,"" said the lad."
"""Have you got it still?"" asked she."
"""Yes"" he had. It was tied round his waist."
"""Might she see it?"""
"""Yes"" she might; and with that he pulled open his waistcoat and shirt to show it to her."
"Then she seized it with both hands, tore it off, and twisted it round her fist."
"""Now,"" she cried, ""what shall I do with such a wretch as you? I'll just give you one blow, and dash your brains out!"""
"""Far too good a death for such a scamp,"" said the Troll. ""No! let's first burn out his eyes, and then turn him adrift in a little boat."""
"So they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift, in spite of his prayers and tears; but, as the boat drifted, the lions swam after, and at last they laid hold of it and dragged it ashore on an island, and placed the lad under a fir tree. They caught game for him, and they plucked the birds and made him a bed of down; but he was forced to eat his meat raw and he was blind. At last, one day the biggest lion was chasing a hare which was blind, for it ran straight over stock and stone, and the end was, it ran right up against a fir-stump and tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring; but lo!"
"when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain, and so saved its life."
"""So, so!"" thought the lion, and went and dragged the lad to the spring, and dipped him over head and ears in it. So, when he had got his sight again, he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie close together like a raft; then he stood upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland. When he had reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse, and made the lions lie quiet. Then he stole up to the castle, like a thief, to see if he couldn't lay hands on his belt; and when he got to the door, he peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen. So he crept softly in across the floor, for there was no one there; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt, he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. Just then his mother came rushing out:"
"""Dear heart, my darling little boy! do give me the belt again,"" she said."
"""Thank you kindly,"" said he. ""Now you shall have the doom you passed on me,"" and he fulfilled it on the spot. When the old Troll heard that, he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death."
"""Well, you may live,"" said the lad, ""but you shall undergo the same punishment you gave me;"" and so he burned out the Troll's eyes, and turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat, but he had no lions to follow him."
"Now the lad was all alone, and he went about longing and longing for the Princess; at last he could bear it no longer; he must set out to seek her, his heart was so bent on having her. So he loaded four ships and set sail for Arabia."
"""Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense."" George kicked his boots against the fencing to warm his toes. ""It's half the world away."""
"""It looks very near,"" said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her neck warm."
"""They're close to the North Pole,"" said George. ""Look here I don't care a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how brave you are."""
Jane got off the fence.
"""Oh, George, let's,"" she said. ""We shall never have such a chance again all alone by ourselves and quite late, too."""
"""I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you,"" George answered gloomily, ""but you know they always say I lead you into mischief and if we went to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and you remember what they said about not going on the grass."""
"""They said the lawn,"" said Jane. ""We're not going on the lawn. Oh, George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so very far we could be back before they had time to get dreadfully angry."""
"""All right,"" said George, ""but mind, I don't want to go."""
"So off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white and shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of the fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly as they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big bonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned."
"""It's like Indians,"" said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in the hedge into another field a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a number of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and twinkled."
"Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than they are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would think they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just when George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the children walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw that the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles hanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still seemed some way off."
"They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the animals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and sizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the hedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears."
"""Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean,"" she said, for she did not want George to think her stupid again."
"There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow and icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and as no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they crept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side."
And then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.
"For in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each side were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs of the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and shining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane said so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's Court Exhibition."
The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away away and away and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.
"There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice the children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE."
"Then George said: ""Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one so here goes."" And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when she saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with feet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North Pole."
"This great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who, during the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy Stores and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never come across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and disobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great slide because you might find something quite different, and then you will be sorry."
"The great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started you have to go on to the end unless you fall down and then it hurts just as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs downhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice the scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the starry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very broad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well as in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said that, and George said: ""I can see the Northern Lights quite plain."""
"It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark ice especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more especially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made no noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over the snow."
"""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and he fell down at once, because it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him and then they crawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide and there was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache, like the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun in his hand."
"""You don't happen to have any bullets about you?"" said he."
"""No,"" George said, truthfully. ""I had five of father's revolver cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake."""
"""Quite so,"" said the sportsman, ""these accidents will occur. You don't carry firearms, then, I presume?"""
"""I haven't any firearms,"" said George, ""but I have a firework. It's only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good."" And he began to feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs and chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets."
"""One could but try,"" the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand."
"But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, ""Ask him what he wants it for."""
"So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill the white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white grouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn, and waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other."
"George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, ""No, I shan't."
"""Theirs not to make reply,    Theirs not to reason why,    Theirs but to do and die:"
"Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred."""
"On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot and shell fell thick and fast, but on through all rode the brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end of the valley. The smoke of the enemy's fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge."
"""Flashed all their sabres bare,    Flashed as they turned in air,    Sabring the gunners there,    Charging an army, while    All the world wonder'd."""
"And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death, did the Light Brigade all that was left of it turn to ride back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of Death."
"""When can their glory fade?"
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd.
Honour the charge they made!
"Honour the Light Brigade,    Noble six hundred!"""
The Coronation of King Edward VII
"Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the English people than that on which King Edward was crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became ill, and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned. But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better, and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined the streets of London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay procession, drove to Westminster Abbey."
"Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the world has ever seen. Princes and princesses from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay uniforms."
"It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King, and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head."
"""The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful seasons, victorious fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire."" These are the words that the old man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great Empire over which he rules."
WAR.
"Over the broad, fair valley,     Filling the heart with fear,   Comes the sound of tramping horses,     And the news of danger near."
"'Tis the enemy approaching,     One can hear the muffled drum,   And the marching of the soldiers,     As on and on they come."
"Soon the air is rent in sunder,     Bullets flying sharp and fast,   Many stout hearts fail and tremble,     Every moment seems their last."
"On the ground lie dead and dying,     Young and old alike must fall;   None to come and aid the sufferer,     Fight they must for freedom's call."
"Many are the anxious loved ones     Praying for the war to cease,   Waiting for the right to conquer,     Bringing freedom, rest, and peace."

"May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh, in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the terrible disaster which is known to the world and will be named in history as the ""Johnstown Flood."""
"For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard, and great floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. Never before had there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their banks, while the people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly there appeared to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping at break-neck speed and bearing a rider who waved his hands to them and cried: ""South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."" Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and jeered. On dashed the rider to warn still others of the impending danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death by the massive timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley. The terrible details of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this. On rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings, churches and buildings of every description, whether of wood, brick or stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed. The town was literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and children were caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their agonizing but vain appeals for help could be heard amidst the mighty roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed by brave men and women yes, and boys in rescuing victims of the flood. Only one of them concerns us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy, seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte from his home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly among the passengers on the express train, as they crowded to view the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the flood reached the train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down the mad tide, an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that the wailing cries of an infant were heard, piercing their way through the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little wailing waif from a watery grave. Strong men urged him to desist, insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life for nothing that it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But the boy was resolved."
"He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it fast to his body, and out into the whirling gulf he went; he gained the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the passengers on the train. ""Wait!"" he cried; ""there is still another in the house, I must save her!"" and, seizing a plank to use as a support, he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle this time was harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating house on his first visit he found a little girl, apparently ten years old, disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay the screaming infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby brother from the fury of the flood. ""God has heard my prayer,"" she cried, as Charles entered the door. ""Oh, save the baby, quick,"" and then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious on the floor, and the water was fast flowing in at the door."
"In another minute she would have been drowned. But the brave boy's manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the young hero fought his way back to land and was given three times three cheers and a ""tiger"" by the passengers of the day express."
A CAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEAP.
"The battle of Antietam was a very fierce one, and undecisive, yet it saved Washington from an invasion by the Confederates, who would have done a good deal of trading there, no doubt, entirely on credit, thus injuring business very much and loading down Washington merchants with book accounts, which, added to what they had charged already to members of Congress, would have made times in Washington extremely dull."
"General McClellan, having impressed the country with the idea that he was a good bridge-builder, but a little too dilatory in the matter of carnage, was succeeded by General Burnside."
"President Lincoln had written the Proclamation of Emancipation to the slaves in July, but waited for a victory before publishing it. Bull Run as a victory was not up to his standard; so when Lee was driven from Maryland the document was issued by which all slaves in the United States became free; and, although thirty-one years have passed at this writing, they are still dropping in occasionally from the back districts to inquire about the truth of the report."
CHAPTER XXVII.
"STILL MORE FRATERNAL BLOODSHED, ON PRINCIPLE. OUTING FEATURES DISAPPEAR, AND GIVE PLACE TO STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN COMBATANTS, WHO BEGIN TO MIX THINGS."
"On December 13 the year's business closed with the battle of Fredericksburg, under the management of General Burnside. Twelve thousand Union troops were killed before night mercifully shut down upon the slaughter."
"The Confederates were protected by stone walls and situated upon a commanding height, from which they were able to shoot down the Yankees with perfect sang-froid and deliberation."
"In the midst of all these discouragements, the red brother fetched loose in Minnesota, Iowa, and Dakota, and massacred seven hundred men, women, and children. The outbreak was under the management of Little Crow, and was confined to the Sioux Nation. Thirty-nine of these Indians were hanged on the same scaffold at Mankato, Minnesota, as a result of this wholesale murder."
This execution constitutes one of the green spots in the author's memory. In all lives now and then an oasis is liable to fall. This was oasis enough to last the writer for years.
"In 1863 the Federal army numbered about seven hundred thousand men, and the Confederates about three hundred and fifty thousand. Still it took two more years to close the war."
"It is held now by good judges that the war was prolonged by the jealousy existing between Union commanders who wanted to be President or something else, and that it took so much time for the generals to keep their eyes on caucuses and county papers at home that they fought best when surprised and attacked by the foe."
"General Grant moved again on Vicksburg, and on May 1, defeated Pemberton at Fort Gibson. He also prevented a junction between Joseph E. Johnston and Pemberton, and drove the latter into Vicksburg, securing the stopper so tightly that after forty-seven days the garrison surrendered, July 4."
"This fight cost the Confederates thirty-seven thousand prisoners, ten thousand killed and wounded, and immense quantities of stores. It was a warm time in Vicksburg; a curious man who stuck his hat out for twenty seconds above the ramparts found fifteen bullet-holes in it when he took it down, and when he wore it to church he attracted more attention than the collection."
"The North now began to sit up and take notice. Morning papers began to sell once more, and Grant was the name on every tongue."
"The Mississippi was open to the Gulf, and the Confederacy was practically surrounded."
"Rosecrans would have moved on the enemy, but learned that the foe had several head of cavalry more than he did, also a team of artillery. At this time John Morgan made a raid into Ohio. He surrounded Cincinnati, but did not take it, as he was not keeping house at the time and hated to pay storage on it. He got to Parkersburg, West Virginia, and was captured there with almost his entire force."
On September 19 and 20 occurred the battle of Chickamauga. Longstreet rushed into a breach in the Union line and swept it with a great big besom of wrath with which he had wisely provided himself on starting out. Rosecrans felt mortified when he came to himself and found that his horse had been so unmanageable that he had carried him ten miles from the carnage.
"But the left, under Thomas, held fast its position, and no doubt saved the little band of sixty thousand men which Rosecrans commanded at the time."
"His army now found itself shut up in intrenchments, with Bragg on the hills threatening the Union forces with starvation."
"On November 24-25 a battle near Chattanooga took place, with Grant at the head of the Federal forces. Hooker came to join him from the Army of the Potomac, and Sherman hurried to his standard from Iuka. Thomas made a dash and captured Orchard Knob, and Hooker, on the following day, charged Lookout Mountain."
"This was the most brilliant, perhaps, of Grant's victories. It is known as the ""battle of Missionary Ridge."" Hooker had exceeded his prerogative and kept on after capturing the crest of Lookout Mountain, while Sherman was giving the foe several varieties of fits, from the north, when Grant discovered that before him the line was being weakened in order to help the Confederate flanks. So with Thomas he crossed through the first line and over the rifle-pits, forgot that he had intended to halt and reform, and concluded to wait and reform after the war was over, when he should have more time, and that night along the entire line of heights the camp-fires of the Union army winked at one another in ghoulish glee."
"The army under Bragg was routed, and Bragg resigned his command."
"Burnside, who had been relieved of the command of the Army of the Potomac, was sent to East Tennessee, where the brave but frost-bitten troops of Longstreet shut him up at Knoxville and compelled him to board at the railroad eating-house there."
"Sherman's worn and weary boys were now ordered at once to the relief of Burnside, and Longstreet, getting word of it, made a furious assault on the former, who repulsed him with loss, and he went away from there as Sherman approached from the west."
"Hooker had succeeded Burnside in the command of the Army of the Potomac, and he judged that, as Lee was now left with but sixty thousand men, while the Army of the Potomac contained one hundred thousand who craved out-of-door exercise, he might do well to go and get Lee, returning in the cool of the evening. Lee, however, accomplished the division of his army while concealed in the woods and sent Jackson to fall on Hooker's rear. The close of the fight found Hooker on his old camping-ground opposite Fredericksburg, murmuring to himself, in a dazed sort of way, ""Where am I?"" Lee felt so good over this that he decided to go North and get something to eat. He also decided to get catalogues and price-lists of Philadelphia and New York while there. Threatening Baltimore in order to mislead General Meade, who was now in command of the Federals, Lee struck into Pennsylvania and met with the Union cavalry a little west of Gettysburg on the Chambersburg road. It is said that Gettysburg was not intended by either army as the site for the battle, Lee hoping to avoid a fight, depending as he did on the well-known hospitality of the Pennsylvanians, and Meade intending to have the fight at Pipe Creek, where he had some property."
"July 1-2-3 were the dates of this memorable battle. The first day was rather favorable to Lee, quite a number of Yankee prisoners being taken while they were lost in the crowded streets of Gettysburg."
"The second day was opened by Longstreet, who charged the Union left, and ran across Sickles, who had by mistake formed in the way of Meade's intended line of battle. They outflanked him, but, as they swung around him, Warren met them with a diabolical welcome, which stayed them."
"Sickles found himself on Cemetery Ridge, while the Confederates under Ewell were on Culp's Hill."
"Calfskin shoes up to the Revolution were the exclusive property of the gentry, and the rest wore cowhide and were extremely glad to mend them themselves. These were greased every week with tallow, and could be worn on either foot with impunity. Rights and lefts were never thought of until after the Revolutionary War, but to-day the American shoe is the most symmetrical, comfortable, and satisfactory shoe made in the world."
"The British shoe is said to be more comfortable. Possibly for a British foot it is so, but for a foot containing no breathing-apparatus or viscera it is somewhat roomy and clumsy."
"Farmers and laborers of those days wore green or red baize in the shape of jackets, and their breeches were made of leather or bed-ticking. Our ancestors dressed plainly, and a man who could not make over two hundred pounds per year was prohibited from dressing up or wearing lace worth over two shillings per yard. It was a pretty sad time for literary men, as they were thus compelled to wear clothing like the common laborers."
"Lord Cornwallis once asked his aidy kong why the American poet always had such an air of listening as if for some expected sound. ""I give it up,"" retorted the aidy kong. ""It is,"" said Lord Cornwallis, as he took a large drink from a jug which he had tied to his saddle, ""because he is trying to see if he cannot hear his bed-ticking."" On the following day he surrendered his army, and went home to spring his bon-mot on George III."
"Yet the laws were very stringent in other respects besides apparel. A man was publicly whipped for killing a fowl on the Sabbath in New England. In order to keep a tavern and sell rum, one had to be of good moral character and possess property, which was a good thing. The names of drunkards were posted up in the alehouses, and the keepers forbidden to sell them liquor. No person under twenty years of age could use tobacco in Connecticut without a physician's order, and no one was allowed to use it more than once a day, and then not within ten miles of any house. It was a common thing to see large picnic-parties going out into the backwoods of Connecticut to smoke."
(Will the reader excuse me a moment while I light up a peculiarly black and redolent pipe?)
"Only the gentry were called Mr. and Mrs. This included the preacher and his wife. A friend of mine who is one of the gentry of this century got on the trail of his ancestry last spring, and traced them back to where they were not allowed to be called Mr. and Mrs., and, fearing he would fetch up in Scotland Yard if he kept on, he slowly unrolled the bottoms of his trousers, got a job on the railroad, and since then his friends are gradually returning to him. He is well pleased now, and looks humbly gratified even if you call him a gent."
"The Scriptures were literally interpreted, and the Old Testament was read every morning, even if the ladies fainted."
"The custom yet noticed sometimes in country churches and festive gatherings of placing the males and females on opposite sides of the room was originated not so much as a punishment to both, as to give the men an opportunity to act together when the red brother felt ill at ease."
"I am glad the red brother does not molest us nowadays, and make us sit apart that way. Keep away, red brother; remain on your reservation, please, so that the pale-face may sit by the loved one and hold her little soft hand during the sermon."
"Church services meant business in those days. People brought their dinners and had a general penitential gorge. Instrumental music was proscribed, as per Amos fifth chapter and twenty-third verse, and the length of prayer was measured by the physical endurance of the performer."
"The preacher often boiled his sermon down to four hours, and the sexton up-ended the hourglass each hour. Boys who went to sleep in church were sand-bagged, and grew up to be border murderers."
"New York people were essentially Dutch. New York gets her Santa Claus, her doughnuts, crullers, cookies, and many of her odors, from the Dutch."
"The New York matron ran to fine linen and a polished door-knocker, while the New England housewife spun linsey-woolsey and knit ""yarn mittens"""
for those she loved.
"Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States, and was noted for its cleanliness and generally sterling qualities of mind and heart, its Sabbath trance and clean white door-steps."
"The Southern Colonies were quite different from those of the North. In place of thickly-settled towns there were large plantations with African villages near the house of the owner. The proprietor was a sort of country squire, living in considerable comfort for those days. He fed and clothed everybody, black or white, who lived on the estate, and waited patiently for the colored people to do his work and keep well, so that they would be more valuable. The colored people were blessed with children at a great rate, so that at this writing, though voteless, they send a large number of members to Congress. This cheers the Southern heart and partially recoups him for his chickens. (See Appendix.)"
"The South then, as now, cured immense quantities of tobacco, while the North tried to cure those who used it."
"Washington was a Virginian. He packed his own flour with his own hands, and it was never inspected. People who knew him said that the only man who ever tried to inspect Washington's flour was buried under a hill of choice watermelons at Mount Vernon."
"Along the James and Rappahannock the vast estates often passed from father to son according to the law of entail, and such a thing as a poor man ""prior to the war"" must have been unknown."
"Education, however, flourished more at the North, owing partly to the fact that the people lived more in communities. Governor Berkeley of Virginia was opposed to free schools from the start, and said, ""I thank God there are no free schools nor printing-presses here, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years."" His prayer has been answered."
CHAPTER XIV.
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
William Pitt was partly to blame for the Revolutionary War. He claimed that the Colonists ought not to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail except by permission of Parliament.
"It was already hard enough to be a colonist, without the privilege of expressing one's self even to an Indian without being fined. But when we pause to think that England seemed to demand that the colonist should take the long wet walk to Liverpool during a busy season of the year to get his horse shod, we say at once that P. Henry was right when he exclaimed that the war was inevitable and moved that permission be granted for it to come."
"Then came the Stamp Act, making almost everything illegal that was not written on stamp paper furnished by the maternal country."
"John Adams, Patrick Henry, and John Otis made speeches regarding the situation. Bells were tolled, and fasting and prayer marked the first of November, the day for the law to go into effect."
"These things alarmed England for the time, and the Stamp Act was repealed; but the king, who had been pretty free with his money and had entertained a good deal, began to look out for a chance to tax the Colonists, and ordered his Exchequer Board to attend to it."
"Patrick Henry got excited, and said in an early speech, ""Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third  "" Here he paused and took a long swig of pure water, and added, looking at the newspaper reporters, ""If this be treason, make the most of it."" He also said that George the Third might profit by their example. A good many would like to know what he started out to say, but it is too hard to determine."
"After Penn's death his heirs ran the Colony up to 1779, when they disposed of it for five hundred thousand dollars or thereabouts, and the State became the proprietor."
"The seventeenth century must have been a very disagreeable period for people who professed religion, for America from Newfoundland to Florida was dotted with little settlements almost entirely made up of people who had escaped from England to secure religious freedom at the risk of their lives."
"In 1634 the first settlement was made by young Lord Baltimore, whose people, the Catholics, were fleeing from England to obtain freedom to worship God as they believed to be right. Thus the Catholics were added to the list of religious refugees, viz., the Huguenots, the Puritans, the Walloons, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the Whigs, and the Menthol Healers."
"Terra Mariæ, or Maryland, was granted to Lord Baltimore, as the successor of his father, who had begun before his death the movement for settling his people in America. The charter gave to all freemen a voice in making the laws. Among the first laws passed was one giving to every human being upon payment of poll-tax the right to worship freely according to the dictates of his own conscience. America thus became the refuge for those who had any peculiarity of religious belief, until to-day no doubt more varieties of religion may be found here than almost anywhere else in the world."
"In 1635 the Virginia Colony and Lord Baltimore had some words over the boundaries between the Jamestown and Maryland Colonies. Clayborne was the Jamestown man who made the most trouble. He had started a couple of town sites on the Maryland tract, plotted them, and sold lots to Yorkshire tenderfeet, and so when Lord Baltimore claimed the lands Clayborne attacked him, and there was a running skirmish for several years, till at last the Rebellion collapsed in 1645 and Clayborne fled."
"The Protestants now held the best hand, and outvoted the Catholics, so up to 1691 there was a never-dying fight between the two, which must have been entertaining to the unregenerate outsider who was taxed to pay for a double set of legislators. This fight between the Catholics and Protestants shows that intolerance is not confined to a monarchy."
"In 1715 the fourth Lord Baltimore recovered the government by the aid of the police, and religious toleration was restored. Maryland remained under this system of government until the Revolution, which will be referred to later on in the most thrilling set of original pictures and word-paintings that the reader has ever met with."
CHAPTER X.
THE EARLY ARISTOCRACY.
"Lord Clarendon and several other noblemen in 1663 obtained from Charles II. a grant of lands lying south of Virginia which they called Carolina in honor of the king, whose name was not really Carolina. Possibly that was his middle name, however, or his name in Latin."
"The Albemarle Colony was first on the ground. Then there was a Carteret Colony in 1670. They ""removed the ancient groves covered with yellow jessamine"" on the Ashley, and began to build on the present site of Charleston."
"The historian remarks that the growth of this Colony was rapid from the first. The Dutch, dissatisfied with the way matters were conducted in New York, and worn out when shopping by the ennui and impudence of the salesladies, came to Charleston in large numbers, and the Huguenots in Charleston found a hearty Southern welcome, and did their trading there altogether."
"We now pass on to speak of the Grand Model which was set up as a five-cent aristocracy by Lord Shaftesbury and the great philosopher John Locke. The canebrakes and swamps of the wild and snake-infested jungles of the wilderness were to be divided into vast estates, over which were proprietors with hereditary titles and outing flannels."
"This scheme recognized no rights of self-government whatever, and denied the very freedom which the people came there in search of. So there were murmurings among those people who had not brought their finger-bowls and equerries with them."
"In short, aristocracy did not do well on this soil. Baronial castles, with hot and cold water in them, were often neglected, because the colonists would not forsake their own lands to the thistle and blue-nosed brier in order to come and cook victuals for the baronial castles or sweep out the baronial halls and wax the baronial floors for a journeyman juke who ate custard pie with a knife and drank tea from his saucer through a King Charles moustache."
"Thus the aristocracy was forced to close its doors, and the arms of Lord Shaftesbury were so humiliated that he could no longer put up his dukes (see Appendix)."
"There had also been a great deal of friction between the Albemarle or Carteret and the Charleston set, the former being from Virginia, while the latter was, as we have seen, a little given to kindergarten aristocracy and ofttimes tripped up on their parade swords while at the plough. Of course outside of this were the plebeian people, or copperas-culottes, who did the work; but Lord Shaftesbury for some time, as we have seen, lived in a baronial shed and had his arms worked on the left breast of his nighty."
"So these two Colonies finally became separate States in the Union, though there is yet something of the same feeling between the people."
"Wealthy people come to the mountains of North Carolina from South Carolina for the cool summer breezes of the Old North State, and have to pay two dollars per breeze even up to the past summer."
"Thus there was constant irritation and disgust up to 1729 at least, regarding taxes, rents, and rights, until, as the historian says, ""the discouraged Proprietors ceded their rights to the crown."""
"It will be noticed that the crown was well ceded by this time, and the poet's remark seems at this time far grander and more apropos than any language of the writer could be: so it is given here, viz., ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a seedy crown."" (See Appendix.)"
"The year of Washington's birth, viz., 1732, witnessed the birth of the baby colony of Georgia. James Oglethorpe, a kind-hearted man, with a wig that fooled more than one poor child of the forest, conceived the idea of founding a refuge for Englishmen who could not pay up. The laws were very arbitrary then, and harsh to a degree. Many were imprisoned then in England for debt, but those who visit London now will notice that they are at liberty."
"Oglethorpe was an officer and a gentleman, and this scheme showed his generous nature and philanthropic disposition. George II. granted him in trust for the poor a tract of land called, in honor of the king, Georgie, which has recently been changed to Georgia. The enterprise prospered remarkably, and generous and charitable people aided it in every possible way. People who had not been able for years to pay their debts came to Georgia and bought large tracts of land or began merchandising with the Indians. Thousands of acres of rich cotton-lands were exchanged by the Indians for orders on the store, they giving warranty deeds to same, reserving only the rights of piscary and massacre."
"Oglethorpe got along with the Indians first-rate, and won their friendship. One great chief, having received a present from Oglethorpe consisting of a manicure set, on the following Christmas gave Oglethorpe a beautiful buffalo robe, on the inside of which were painted an eagle and a portable bath-tub, signifying, as the chief stated, that the buffalo was the emblem of strength, the eagle of swiftness, and the bath-tub the advertisement of cleanliness. ""Thus,"" said the chief, ""the English are strong as the buffalo, swift as the eagle, and love to convey the idea that they are just about to take a bath when you came and interrupted them."""
"The Moravians also came to Georgia, and the Scotch Highlanders. On the arrival of the latter, the Georgia mosquitoes held a mass meeting, at which speeches were made, and songs sung, and resolutions adopted making the Highland uniform the approved costume for the entire coast during summer."

"(_c_) In all other languages, under the name following the prefix, with"
cross-references whenever the name has been commonly used in English
"with the prefix, as _Del Rio_, _Vandyck, Van Ess_: e.g. _Gama, Vasco"
"da_, _Goethe, J. W. von_."
"But when the name is printed as one word, entry is made under the"
"prefix, as _Vanderhaeghen_."
(_d_) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated by the rules of
the nation adopting them.
"Thus German names preceded by _von_, when belonging to Russians, are to"
"be entered under _Von_, as this is the Russian custom. So when Dutch"
names compounded with _van_ are adopted into French or English (as _Van
Laun_) the _Van_ is treated as part of the family name.
"Prefixes are _d', de, de La_ (the name goes under _La_ not _de_),"
"_Des, Du, L', La, Le, Les, St, Ste_ (to be arranged as if written"
"_Saint, Sainte_), _da, dal, dalla, dalle, dai, dagli, del, della,"

"of the Woods_, _Isles of Shoals_; but there is more reason for"
hymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the Gospel
"Songs section of the _Hymnary_ might well be classified as hymns, e.g.,"
"Nos. 441, 444, 447, 458, 463, 468, 470, 471, 472, and 492. Either words"
or music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.

"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”
"fine--it made me ashamed of my silly standards, my fears."""
"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious men and women; as
over tomorrow. We can stay there for a few days. I shall welcome the
"change for this place has been very stupid for me, my dear."""
"""Poor mamma! I've been selfish. It'll be a lark seeing Cora Truxton"
"again!"" Pola had explained to Sidney: ""We met the Truxtons at Nice."
"Cora and Millicent are both older, but they're the _cutest_ girls. Will"
"we go in the morning, mamma?"""
Pola's manner had indicated that the coming of the Truxtons into their
plans raised a barrier that now excluded Sidney. Throughout the dinner
she had talked exclusively of the trip on the morrow and the renewing
of that acquaintance that had begun in Nice. But Sidney felt nothing
but a sense of escape.
She found Aunt Achsa alone in the cottage on Sunset Lane. She was
"sitting on the doorstep, ""coolin' off."" Sidney sat down beside her."
"""Where's Lavender?"" she asked, wishing Lavender was at home that she"
"might begin her ""making up"" at once."
"""Don't know. And I wish I did. Don't know what's gotten into that boy."
"I'm as worried as can be."""
"""About Lav? Oh, what's the matter?"" For Aunt Achsa was close to tears."
Something must have happened to break her habitual optimism.
"""He's acted so queer like lately. Cal'late you'd of noticed it if you"
hadn't been off so much with Mr. Dugald's folks. I thought it might a'
"been his stomach and I put a powder into his coffee, but he ain't been"
"a mite different--"""
"""But what does he do, Aunt Achsa? He looks all right--"""
"was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no"
"good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old"
"spider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the"
"dining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,"
"the office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!"
Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window
"shone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the"
"big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away"
"sounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long"
time. He’d been forgotten. What had all this to do with him—this house
"and Charlotte, the girls and Harold—what did he know about them? They"
were strangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his
wife. His wife!
"... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped"
"sorrowful, mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were"
"round his neck. A face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice"
"breathed, “Good-bye, my treasure.”"
"My treasure! “Good-bye, my treasure!” Which of them had spoken? Why had"
they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. _She_ was his
"wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a"
dream.
"Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his"
"hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, “Dinner is on the"
"table, sir!”"
"“I’m coming, I’m coming,” said old Mr. Neave."
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
"""I suppose so."""
"""And the way I phrased it. I actually said I'd bought the lower right"
"hand drawer and hadn't used it--take me with you, Frank."""
"""Rhoda, I was so wrong in--"""
"""_I_ was wrong, Frank. I was trying to mold you into my way of life. I"
"wanted you, but only as a part of my own eager little world. I had money"
"so I furnished my apartment. I put this here and that there, and hung a"
"toothbrush over the sink as necessarily functional, and then I decided I"
needed a man in the same way and so I picked you.
"""But I found out that the man in the bed was the most important part of"
it and without him there wasn't anything. Without him I didn't want any
of the other. Now ... I want to be a wife. A wife is a person who goes
where her husband goes and lives where he lives and shares what he has.
You don't barter and trade--this for that--give up this part to get
that. You give up everything and yet it isn't like that at all because
"you're really getting everything."""
He took out another cigarette.
"""Oh, Frank, it's all mixed up and I'm going to cry, I think."""
"""It's not mixed up at all,"" he said quietly. He turned to look at her,"
"half frowning, half smiling. ""Now why in the hell couldn't you have"
given me a little notice? Twenty minutes to plane time and I've got to
"get another reservation."""
"""I'm sorry, Frank."""
"grunted: ""It's been in two days!"""
By the time they reached the _Arabella_ Sidney's remorse was yielding
"to a spark of indignation. Lav needn't be _quite_ so mad for, after"
"all, it had been his own precious Mr. Dugald who had thrown her and"
Pola so constantly together! And if Lav had not hidden himself away he
most certainly would have been included in all the plans. It was not
fair in Lav to act so cross.
"""I know you came out to read, Lav, and I've some thinking to do, so I'm"
"going up in the bow and leave you quite to yourself,"" Sidney said as"
"they boarded the _Arabella_, and if in her tone there was something of"
"Mart's tartness, it may be forgiven for Sidney had been punished enough."
"""I don't care if you hang 'round,"" Lav conceded. ""It's too hot to read,"
"anyways. I thought maybe there'd be a breeze out here. What's that?"""
For he had suddenly spied an object lying on the deck close to the rail
as though it had dropped there from someone's pocket.
"At almost the same moment Sidney spied it, too. Both darted for it."
Lavender reached it first and picked it up and examined it with
frowning eyes.
"""It's a knife!"" cried Sidney, at his elbow."
"""Sure it's a knife. Anybody can see that. What I want to know--"""
"""Let me look at it. Isn't it Mr. Dugald's?"""
"""No, it isn't Mr. Dugald's. He hasn't been out here for a week. And"
"that knife wasn't here yesterday for I'd a' seen it."""
"from Flatfolk ways."""
"""Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?"
"What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope--"""
He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the
"lifeboat. ""Questions you ask,"" he said in his soft voice. ""Venus is a"
"sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a"
"boss-minded sister."""
"""I'm not a dryleg,"" I told him proudly. ""_We're_ from Undersea."""
"""_Dryhorn_, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?"""
"""Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just"
"like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns."" And then I told him"
"how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when"
the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers
figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.
*       *       *       *       *
He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were
bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just
about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.
He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the
first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood
listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked
"disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World"
"Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after"
series of rapid flashes followed by an equal number of detonations. The
"upper air was filled with a blending of high notes--a whizzing, droning,"
"and sibilant buzzing, and pipings that died down in faint wails. The"
"little white speck moved on. It entered a film of straggling cloud, but"
soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a
moment and found it again. Then they lost it altogether and nothing
remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.
"""I bet 'e's took some photographs--'e'll be over to-night. I reckon"

without Martyanoff because he could not play honestly. After cheating
"several times, he openly confessed:"
"""I cannot play without cheating ... it is a habit of mine."""
"""Habits do get the better of you,"" assented Deacon Taras.  ""I always"
"used to beat my wife every Sunday after Mass, and when she died I"
cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"
"married again!"" ..."
"""You are lying, Deacon!  How could you marry a second time?"""
interrupted Abyedok.
"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"
boy!  Two died of diphtheria ...  One of the daughters married a
student and went with him to Siberia.  The other went to the University
"of St. Petersburg and died there ... of consumption they say. Ye--es,"
"there were five of them.... Ecclesiastics are prolific, you know.""  He"
"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"
"burst at his tales. When the laughter stopped, Aleksei Maksimovitch"
Simtsoff remembered that he too had once had a daughter.
"""Her name was Lidka ... she was very stout ...""  More than this he did"
interpret it.
"Steve rode by me, and his face too was moody. I suppose that we should"
all of us have thanked God the peril was past. But my lady rode in
another part with Count Leuchtenstein and the Waldgrave; and Steve
"yearned, I fancy, for the old days of trouble and equality, when there"
was no one to come between us.
"I saw Count Hugo that night. He sent for me to his quarters at Hesel,"
and told me frankly that he would have let me go back had he thought
good could come of it.
"'But it would have been looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, my"
"friend,' he continued. 'Tzerclas' men would have picked you up, or the"
"peasants killed you for a soldier, and in a month perhaps the girl"
"would have returned safe and sound, to find you dead.'"
"'My lord!' I cried passionately, 'she saved your child. It was to her"
as her own!'
"'I know it,' he answered with gravity, which of itself rebuked me."
'And where is my child?'
I shook my head.
'Yet I do not give up my work and the task God and the times have
"given me, and go out looking for it!' he answered severely. 'Leaving"
"Scot, and Swede, and Pole, and Switzer to divide my country. For"
"shame! You have your work too, and it lies by your lady's side. See to"
"it that you do it. For the rest I have scouts out, who know the"
country; if I learn anything through them you shall hear it. And now
"of another matter. How long has the Waldgrave been like this, my"
that did not feel--a happy world!
She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window.
She got up from the tea-table to let him in.  Why do faces gazing in
"through glass from darkness always look hungry--searching, appealing for"
what you have and they have not?  And while she was undoing the latch she
thought: 'What am I going to say?  I feel nothing!'  The ardour of his
"gaze, voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even"
more comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
"""Please take care; I'm still brittle!""  Then she sat down again and"
asked:
"""Will you have some tea?"""
"""Tea!  I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp!  Do you"
know what I have felt like all this time?  No; you don't know. You know
"nothing of me--do you?"""
A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips--without her knowing it was
there.  She said:
"""Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?""  And, without her will,"
"against her will, the words slipped out: ""I'm afraid you've missed the"
"music-room!"""
His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
"""Missed!  Missed everything!  I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no"
"idea how miserable.  Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!""  With each"
"repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer.  And kneeling down in"
"front of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind"
"""Mart!"" she cried. ""It's _not_ Jed Starrow! It's--it's--Cap'n Phin"
"Davies! And that means that--_Lav_--_made_--_it_!"" And happy tears ran"
down her cheeks.
Under the skilled guidance of the man at its wheel the _Sally_ soon
came alongside of the _Arabella_. Cap'n Davies promptly boarded the
schooner and the next instant Sidney was in his arms.
"""All I'll say is praise be to God!"" the old mariner muttered. ""And now"
I cal'late you and your mates here are 'bout ready to abandon your
"cruisin'--"""
"""Lav, is he--all right?"" demanded Sidney, still clinging to Cap'n Phin."
"""Well, he jest about made port and how he is now I can't say for I"
didn't waste any time shippin' in the _Sally_. Lucky for us it was
"lyin' there at Rockman's. Give us a hand, Saunders, while we load on"
"this cargo of distress!"" A roughness in the old man's voice betrayed"
that the big heart was not as light as he would have the girls think.
For hours they had searched the bay with only their knowledge of tides
and winds to guide them; more than once the others had been ready to
"abandon the search as futile, but the Captain had held them stubbornly"
to it.
Pola needed no urging but leaped into the _Sally_ and sank to its
bottom with a long gasp of relief. Sidney and Mart were about to follow
her example when a word from Cap'n Davies held Sidney.
"""We'll let a government boat pick up the _Arabella_. We'll take no"
"chances tryin' to tow her in with the _Sally_."" And then Sidney thought"
of the treasure.
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha!"" laughed the other sprout."
"Yes, truly, they had acquired dashing ways among their sporting"
acquaintances.
"It rained for three weeks; then came two fine days, and then rain again"
"for a fortnight. The sun was not to be seen, the sky was invisible, the"
mountain tops had disappeared; we saw nothing but rain. The roofs at the
Tore Peak resort began to leak more and more.
"The hay that still lay spread on the ground was black and rotting, and the"
stacks had gone moldy.
The cotters had got their hay indoors during the patient spell. They had
"carried it, man, woman, and child, on their backs."
The men from Bergen and Mrs. Brede with her children have left for home.
The little girls curtsied and thanked me for taking them walking in the
hills and telling them stories. The house is empty now. Associate Master
"Höy and Mrs. Molie were the last to go; they left last week, traveling"
"separately, though both were going to the same small town."
He went by way of the village--a very roundabout route--while she crossed
"the field. It is very quiet now, but Miss Torsen is still here."
Why do I not leave? Don't know. Why ask? I'm here. Have you ever heard
"anyone ask: ""How much is a northern light?"" Hold your tongue."
Where should I go if I did leave? Do you imagine I want to go to the town
"again? Or do you think I'm longing for my old hut and the winter, and"
Madame? I'm not longing for any specific place; I am simply longing.
almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the

"looked about him a moment, then taking me by the arm, led me to the Stone"
"Gallery and thence to the garden. I wanted to stop, but he kept his grasp"
"on my arm, repeating now and then the word ""Come"" in whispers, till we"
"reached a lonely spot in St. James Park. There he halted, and though"
"there was not a living creature in sight, he brought his lips to my ear"
"and breathed the name, ""'Sieur George Hamilton."""
"I tried not to show that I was startled, but the quickwitted, sharp-eyed"
"Frenchman read me as though I were an open book, and grasping my hand,"
cried out:--
"""Ah, I knew you could tell me. It is to rejoice! I knew it!"""
"""Tell you what, count?"" I asked."
"""Tell me where your friend and mine is, or if you will not tell me, take"
"to him a letter. I have been trying to find him this fortnight."""
"""I cannot tell you where he is, my dear count--"""
"""Of course not! I do not ask,"" he interrupted."
"""--But I may be able to forward your letter to him. I heard only the"
"other day that he was in France."""
"""Of course, of course, he is in France! Not in England at all! Good,"
good! I see you are to be trusted. But I must have your word of honor
"that the letter will be delivered."""
"""I shall send it by none but a trusted messenger,"" I answered, ""and shall"
return it to you unopened unless I am convinced beyond a doubt that it
every moment was precious.
"'Bring nothing but cloaks and food and wine,' I said. 'We have to go a"
league on foot and can carry little.'
"The Countess heard my words, and looked at me with growing"
comprehension. 'The Waldgrave?' she muttered. 'Is he here?'
"He came forward from the door to speak to her; but when she saw him,"
"and how pale and thin he was, with great hollows in his cheeks and his"
"eyes grown too large for his face, she began to cry weakly, as any"
"other woman might have cried, being overwrought. I bade Marie, who"
"alone kept her wits, to bring her wine and make her take it; and in a"
"minute she smiled at us, and would have thanked us."
"'Wait!' I said bluntly, feeling a great horror upon me whenever I"
looked towards the general or caught his eye. 'You may have small
"cause to thank us. If we fail, Heaven and you forgive us, my lady, for"
this man will not. If we are retaken----'
'We will not be retaken!' she cried hardily. 'You have horses?'
"'Five only,' I answered. 'They are all Steve could get, and they are a"
"league away. We must go to them on foot. There are eight of us here,"
and young Jacob and Ernst are watching outside. Are all ready?'
"My lady looked round; her eye fell on Fraulein Max, who with a little"
bundle in her arms had just re-entered and stood shivering by the
"door. The Dutch girl winced under her glance, and dropping her bundle,"
stooped hurriedly to pick it up.
'That woman does not go!' the Countess said suddenly.
"""_That_ was my daughter,"" Mrs. Warren informed him with pride...."
"""She is a lady who has taken a high degree at an English University."
She has been an important person in the English feminist movement.
"When this dreadful war is over, I and my daughter will--"""
"At this juncture Vivie entered. ""_Mother_, I hope you haven't"
"missed me, haven't been unwell?"" she said, looking rather"
"questioningly at the little glass of Schnapps, only half of which"
had been drunk.
"""Well yes, dear, I have. _Terrible_ low spirits and all swimmy-like."
Thought I was going to faint. But this man here has been so kind
"""--her tears flowed afresh--""We've bin talking of old times; he used"
"to know me before--"""
"_Vivie_: ""Quite so. But I think, dear, we had better be going back."
I want to talk to you about the new rooms I've seen. Are you equal
to walking? If not perhaps this kind man would try to get us a
"cab...?"""
"But Mrs. Warren said it was no distance, only round the corner, and"
she could well walk. When they got back she would go and lie down.
"Vivie, reading her mother's thoughts, pressed a five-franc note into"
"the gardener's not reluctant palm, and they regained the Rue Royale."
But just as they were passing through the revolving door of the
"Hotel Impérial, a German who had been installed as manager came up"
"with two soldiers and said explosively: ""Heraus! Foutez-nous le"
"camp! Aout you go! Don't show your face here again!"""
"""But,"" said Vivie, ""our notice doesn't expire till the end of this"
"immediately recognized Colonel-General of Aviation Anatoly Savitsky,"
whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in Soviet Military Review;
"Major- General Igor Mikhailov, whose picture routinely graced the pages"
"of Air Defense Herald; and also Colonel-General Pavel Ogarkov, a"
marshal of the Soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the
general secretary.
What are those Air Force neanderthals doing here? They're all notorious
"hardliners, the ""bomb first, ask questions later"" boys. And _Daedalus_"
"is supposed to be for space research, right? Guess the bullshit is"
about to be over. We're finally getting down to the real scenario.
"And there in the middle, clearly the man in charge, was a tall, silver-"
haired Japanese in a charcoal silk suit. He was showing off the
"vehicles as though he owned them, and he carried himself with an"
authority that made all the hovering Soviet generals look like bellboys
waiting for a tip.
"Well, Yuri Andreevich thought, for the time being he does own them."
"They're bought and paid for, just like us."
"""_Tovarisch_, Major Androv, _kak pazhavatye_,"" came a voice behind him."
"He turned and realized it belonged to General Valentin Sokolov,"
commander of the MiG 31 wing at the Dolinsk air base on Sakhalin.
"Sokolov was three star, top man in all the Soviet Far East. Flanking"
him were half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels.
"""Comrade General Sokolov."" He whipped off a quick salute. Brass. Brass"
everywhere. Shit. What in hell was this all about?
"Now the project director, Taro Ikeda, had broken away from the Soviet"
"group and was approaching. ""Yuri Andreevich, thank you for coming."" He"
But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he rolled
over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
"shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt."
"But now he had his hand on the _kobun's_ throat, holding him in a"
powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster.
Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.
"The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would bring a more"
powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the man's
"windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the"
"_kobun's_ eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders"
slacken.
Now.
He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster. Then his
hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
"now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from"
getting the grip he needed.
"He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his finger on"
the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.
"With his other hand he shoved the _kobun_'s face away, clawing at his"
"eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more against"
the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.
"He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed to come"
"from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had"
"been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his"
thought that she had been unjust was iron through Mrs. Carmichael's
"soul, for above all things she prided herself on her fairness. She"
pushed her work away and went over to Beatrice's side. Mrs. Cary's
"head still rested against the aching shoulder, and Mrs. Carmichael"
made a sign to let her improvize a cushion substitute. Beatrice shook
her head.
"""No, thank you,"" she whispered, glancing down at the flushed, sleeping"
"face. ""We have done each other so little real service that I am glad"
to be able to do even this much. I don't suppose it will be for long.
"How quiet everything is!"""
Mrs. Carmichael looked at the clock on the writing-table.
"""It is not yet midnight,"" she said. ""Probably the Rajah is keeping his"
"promise."" Her expression relaxed a little. ""Don't tire yourself,"" she"
"added bruskly to Mrs. Berry, who had been fanning the unconscious"
"woman's face with an improvized paper fan. ""I don't think she feels"
"the heat."""
The missionary's wife continued her good work with redoubled energy.
It was perhaps one of the few really unselfish things which she had
"ever done in the course of a pious but fundamentally selfish life, and"
it gave her pleasure and courage. The knowledge that some one was
weaker than herself and needed her was new strength to her new-born
heroism.
"""It is so frightfully hot,"" she said half apologetically. ""Why isn't"
"the punkah-man at work?"""
"""The 'punkah-man' has bolted with the rest of them,"" Mrs. Carmichael"
"answered. ""I dare say I could work it, though I have never tried."""
obstinately.
"'Wait,' he said; 'I will ask.'"
But when the old housekeeper came she had only the same tale to tell.
She was alone. No young woman had crossed the threshold for a week
"past. There was no other woman there, young or old."
'You will have it that I have a young man in the house next!' she
"grumbled, shooting scorn at me."
"'I can assure you that there is no one here,' Herr Krapp said civilly."
"'Dorcas has been with me many years, and I can trust her. Still if you"
like you can walk through the rooms.'
"But I hesitated to do that. The man's manner evidenced his sincerity,"
"and in face of it my belief wavered. Fancy, I began to think, had"
played me a trick. It was no great wonder if the features which were
"often before me in my dreams, and sometimes painted themselves on the"
"darkness while I lay wakeful, had for once taken shape in the"
"daylight, and so vividly as to deceive me. I apologised. I said what"
"was proper, and, with a heavy sigh, went from the door."
"Ay, and with bent head. The passing crowd and the sunshine and the"
distant music of drum and trumpet grated on me. For there was yet
another explanation. And I feared that Marie was dead.
I was still brooding sadly over the matter when I reached home. Steve
"met me at the door, but, feeling in no mood for small talk just then,"
"I would have passed him by and gone in, if he had not stopped me."
"'I have a message for you, lieutenant,' he said."
"By mutual consent, Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice ceased to talk, but"
"when suddenly there was a movement close to them, and a dim light"
"flashed over the partition, they exchanged a glance of meaning."
"""That is my husband,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""Something is going"
"to happen. Listen!"""
She was not wrong in her supposition. The Colonel had entered the next
"room, followed by Nicholson and Saunders, and had closed the door"
carefully after him. All three men carried lanterns. They glanced
instinctively at the wooden partition which divided them from the four
"women, but Carmichael shook his head."
"""It's all right,"" he said. ""They must be fast asleep, poor souls."
"Let's have a look at these fellows."" He went over to a huddled-up"
figure lying in the shadow. The corner of a military cloak had been
thrown over the face. He drew it on one side and then let it drop.
"""Gone!"" he said laconically. He passed on to the next. There were in"
"all three men ranged against the wall. Two of them were dead. ""Martins"
"told me they couldn't last,"" Colonel Carmichael muttered. ""It is"
"better for them. They are out of it a little sooner, that's all."" The"
"third man was Travers. He lay on his back, his face turned slightly"
"toward the wall, his eyes closed. He seemed asleep. The Colonel nodded"
"somberly. ""Another ten hours,"" he calculated."
"He came back to the table, where the others waited, and drew out a"
paper from his pocket.
"""Give me your light a moment, Nicholson,"" he said."
No one spoke while he examined the list before him. All around them
"Dagoes, and Dutchmen and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you and Salisbury"
"'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.  Vig'lance, difficulties, bright"
"look-out, and the rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!  That's"
"me!"""
"And very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased, for the"
captain lay snoring in his cabin.
"The _Potluck_ was a barque of eleven hundred tons' register, and was"
"bound for Adelaide, with a general cargo of all mixed things under"
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged in running down her
"easting, and, as her skipper believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44°"
"30' S., Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.  The westerly"
"winds were blowing hard, but had the worst chill of winter off, for"
"the month was September.  Nevertheless, as old Jones, the skipper,"
"was on a composite track, with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was"
bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all
"concerned if he had drunk less, talked little, and minded his own"
business instead of arguing foreign politics.
But to each man Fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts
to be his particular skill in the universe.
"When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight, the weather was thick, and"
"neither man's temper was of the sweetest, so they had a bit of a"
breeze.
"""What kind of a relief d'ye call this?' growled Simcox."
"""I call it a very good relief,"" replied Lampert, ""and a darned sight"
"better one than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes even now."""
"grounds, chatting and sipping tea, I was watching, watching. And my hand"
"was never far from the butt of the Webley automatic which, slung from my"
"waist, was hidden in a bag of silk."""
"""Heavens!"" he cried out. ""You are...."""
"""Hush,"" interposed Madame. ""A lawyer and a Gatepath should be more"
"discreet. The war is over, and I can tell you now that I fought every"
"minute of it in the Secret Service, the Civil branch. I was the head"
"woman, the bright particular star, in Dawson's Secret Corps."""
"""Is it discreet to tell me this?"" he asked, countering her reproof of a"
moment earlier.
"She smiled rather wickedly. ""Are you not a lawyer and a Gatepath? And"
"can one not tell anything to a lawyer and a Gatepath? Besides, I have"
"sent in my resignation, and am now a free woman. It has been a good"
"time, a very good time. I have fought devils and mastered devils in"
"England and France and Italy for four long years, and now I would rest."
You say that time and sorrow have spared me. Yet I have known both time
"and sorrow. Have I not lost...."""
"He broke into a babble of apologies. ""I did not know.... I did not"
"realise...."""
"She waved a hand, and he fell silent. ""I do not wear the trappings of"
"woe, for though I am eternally widowed, I glory in my loss. It was in"
"the rearguard at Caporetto, when all less gallant souls had fled, that"
"my Guilberti fell."""
Of course from that moment Gatepath was her slave. She had flattered him
and humbugged him as she flattered and humbugged all of us. Madame had
"bought Lilly, body and soul--with promises."" The king shrugged his"
"shoulders and whispered: ""With promises, you understand, Baron Ned, with"
"promises. Now give him a chance at the Abbé."""
"Charles laughed and chuckled in self-gratulation, not the least"
suspecting that he was talking to the wrong man and playing into the
French king's hand. I bore in mind the fact that the king had bought
"Lilly with promises, and I determined to buy the good Doctor with ready"
gold.
"""I'll try to carry out your Majesty's commands,"" I answered, apparently"
"doubtful of my ability. ""But of course you would not have me insist, if"
"the Abbé seems disinclined to consult Lilly."""
"""No, no! Odds fish, man, no! But find a way to bring them together,"
"and your reward will come later. I choose, you for this little piece of"
business because you are in no way connected with the affair between the
"French king and me, and because I know you are to be trusted."""
I to be trusted! So was Brutus!
"""I shall do my best, your Majesty, and if I fail, I shall notify you at"
"once,"" I said, taking my leave."
"I hastened to De Grammont's house, which at that time was over near the"
"Mall, and told the count what the king had said."
"""Ah, that is good!"" cried De Grammont. ""A fool, who knows himself to be a"
"fool, is likely to be wary, but one who deems himself wise is the easiest"
"dupe in the world. I'll see Monsieur l'Abbé. Wait."""
"De Grammont returned in a few minutes, saying that the Abbé would go with"
"calculations, took no notice of the dark group of men, who were taking"
such a wicked delight in adding to his father's discomfiture.  He did
not even once look in their direction.
"""The young spider has himself well in hand,"" remarked Abyedok, watching"
young Petunikoff's every movement and action.  Having taken all the
"measurements he desired, Ivan Andreyevitch knit his brows, got into the"
"cart, and drove away.  His son went with a firm step into Vaviloff's"
"eating-house, and disappeared behind the door."
"""Ho, ho!  That's a determined young thief! ...  What will happen next,"
"I wonder ...?"" asked Kuvalda."
"""Next?  Young Petunikoff will buy out Egor Vaviloff,"" said Abyedok with"
"conviction, and smacked his lips as if the idea gave him great pleasure."
"""And you are glad of that?"" Kuvalda asked him, gravely."
"""I am always pleased to see human calculations miscarry,"" explained"
"Abyedok, rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands with delight.  The"
Captain spat angrily on the ground and was silent. They all stood in
"front of the tumble-down building, and silently watched the doors of"
the eating-house.  More than an hour passed thus.  Then the doors
opened and Petunikoff came out as silently as he had entered.  He
"stopped for a moment, coughed, turned up the collar of his coat,"
"glanced at the men, who were following all his movements with their"
"eyes, and then went up the street towards the town."
"The Captain watched him for a moment, and turning to Abyedok said,"
smilingly:
"""Probably you were right after all, you son of a scorpion and a"
'The second from the door end of the house?' he asked.
"'No, the third.'"
He nodded with an air of quiet triumph. 'Just so!' he said. 'I thought
"so afterwards. But the fact is, my friend, my house ends with the"
"second gable. The third gable-end does not belong to it, though"
doubtless it once did.'
"'No?' I exclaimed. And for a moment I stood taken aback, cursing my"
"carelessness. Then I stammered, 'But this third gable--I saw no door"
"in it, Herr Krapp.'"
"'No, the door is in another street,' he answered. 'Or rather it opens"
on the churchyard at the back of St. Austin's. So you may have seen
"her after all. Well, I wish you well,' he continued. 'I must be"
going.'
"The crowd was beginning to separate, moving away by twos and threes,"
talking loudly. The lights were dying down. He nodded and was gone;
while I still stood gaping. For how did the matter stand? If I had
really seen Marie at the window--as seemed possible now--and if
"nothing turned out to be amiss at home, then I had not been tricked"
"after all, and the message was genuine. True she had not kept her"
"appointment. But she might be in durance, or one of a hundred things"
might have frustrated her intention.
"Still I could do nothing now except go home, and cutting short my"
"speculations, I forced myself through the press, and with some labour"
"managed to reach the door. As I did so I turned to look back, and the"
"sight, though the people were moving away fast, was sufficiently"
"The end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_"
"(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,"
"pretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the"
"pirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,"
"flinging overboard their black flag ""that it might not rise in Judgement"
"over them."" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look"
"for Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a"
"savoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,"
"but refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut"
"his cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this"
"early hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had"
been sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a
"grape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully"
"dressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to"
"his repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,"
"as he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been ""A"
"short life and a merry one."" One good word can be said for Roberts, that"
he never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.
"ROBERTS, OWEN. Welsh pirate."
"Carpenter in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and killed on November 22nd, 1718,"
off the North Carolina Coast.
"ROBINSON, EDWARD."
Of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
"Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718."
"me to see Doctor Lilly, and I suggested that I return for him in three"
hours.
"I went back to Whitehall, where I found Frances, and told her to be at"
"Lilly's house on the Strand within three hours, to meet the French king's"
"ambassador, and to receive the instructions which George's letter had"
"intimated the Abbé would give. I told her, also, that the Abbé was not"
the person we had expected to see.
"The evening before, she was ready to die of fright because we believed"
"that the Abbé was George Hamilton, and now, since I had found he was not,"
she was ready to die of disappointment--so she assured me.
"At the appointed time, De Grammont, the Abbé, and I took the count's"
"barge and went down to the water stairs nearest Temple Bar, where the"
Abbé and I left De Grammont and walked up through the crowded streets to
"Lilly's house. Owing to the crowded condition of the street, the Abbé and"
I found no opportunity to exchange words until we were before Lilly's
house.
"Lilly was at home, I having sent word of our coming, so when we knocked,"
"the servant opened and directed us to the waiting parlor, saying that the"
Doctor would soon come down.
"We started upstairs, I in the lead, the Abbé following ten paces behind."
"When I entered the room, I found Bettina and Frances sitting by the"
"street window. They came to me quickly, and Frances explained Bettina's"
presence.
"""I did not like to come here alone, so I asked Betty to come with me. She"
"is to be trusted."""
"“Thanks,” said Mrs. Winstanley, and then, suddenly looking at Yvonne--"
"“Mercy, my dear! How white you are!”"
"“There’s nothing the matter with me,” said Yvonne, trying to smile."
"“It’s past our _déjeuner_ hour,” said the Canon, briskly. “You want some"
food.”
"“Perhaps I do,” said Yvonne."
"She went with the Canon on to the _digue_, and walked along the shady"
"side, by the hotels, past the gay terraces thronged with lunching"
guests. But all the glamour had gone from the place. An hour had changed
it. And that hour seemed a black abyss separating her from happiness.
"An hour ago she had looked upon this kind, grave man who walked by"
her side as her husband. Now what was he to her? She shrank from the
"thought, terrified, and came nearer to him, touching the flying skirt of"
his coat as if to take strength from him.
"They entered the crowded dining-room, where the _maître d’hôtel_ had"
"reserved them a table. She struggled bravely through part of the meal,"
strove to keep up a conversation. But the strain was too great. Another
"five minutes, she felt, would make her hysterical. She rose, with an"
"excuse to the Canon, and escaped to her room."
There she flung herself down on the bed and buried her face in the cool
pillows. It was a relief to be alone with her fright and dismay. She
"strove to think, but her head was in a whirl. The incidents of the late"
"scene came luridly before her mind, and she shivered with revulsion. A"
rough hand had been laid on the butterfly and brushed the dust from its
"twenty...."""
My own thoughts run away with me as I stand there wishing I were somewhere
"else. Perhaps she, too, in her room wishes me far away."
"""Good-bye,"" I say to the actor. ""Will you remember me to Miss Torsen? I"
"must go now."""
"""Good-bye,"" says he, shaking hands in some surprise. ""Can't you wait a few"
"minutes? Well, all right, I'll give her your greeting. Good-bye,"
"good-bye."""
"I take a short cut to get out of the way, and as I know every nook and"
"corner, I am soon outside the farm, and find a good shelter. From here I"
shall see when these two leave. She has only to say good-bye now to the
people of the farm.
It struck me that yesterday was the last time I spoke to her. We spoke
"only a few insignificant words that I have forgotten, and today I have not"
spoken to her....
Here they come.
Curious--they seemed somehow to have become welded together; though they
"walked separately up the mountain track, yet they belonged together. They"
did not speak; the essential things had probably already been said. Life
had grown ordinary for them; it still remained to them to be of use to
"each other. He walked first, while she followed many paces behind; it was"
lonely to look at against the rugged background of the mountain. Where had
her tall figure gone to? She seemed to have grown shorter because she had
hitched up her skirt and was carrying her knapsack on her back. They each
"carried one, but he carried hers and she his, probably because, owing to"
"TOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
A buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French
"fleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew"
of 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached
such a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of
"their French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that"
"took and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French"
"pirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of"
"Quibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels"
while the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French
comrades and sacked Granada.
"His next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where"
he found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was
afraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.
"In August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish"
"men-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish"
ships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant
"Townley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards."
"TRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer."
"In the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain"
Sharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing
"terrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic"
"seaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay."
"The buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,"
"to glitter with a queer metallic sheen. Then, from each of the three,"
as they passed over the boundary--nothing! All radio communication
"ceased as abruptly as though they'd been stricken dead."""
"He stared at Brand. ""That's all I can tell you, little enough, God"
knows. Something ominous and strange is contained in that red spot:
"but what its nature may be, we cannot even guess. I want you to go"
"there and find out."""
"Brand's determined jaw jutted out, and his lips thinned to a"
purposeful line. He stood to attention.
"""I'll be leaving to-night, sir. Or sooner if you like. I could go this"
"afternoon: in an hour--"""
"""To-night is soon enough,"" said Stone with a smile. ""Now, who do you"
"want to accompany you?"""
Brand thought a moment. On so long a journey as a trip to Jupiter
there was only room in a space ship--what with supplies and all--for
one other man. It behooved him to pick his companion carefully.
"""I'd like Dex Harlow,"" he said at last. ""He's been to Jupiter before,"
"working with me in plotting the northern hemisphere. He's a good man."""
"""He is,"" agreed Stone, nodding approval of Brand's choice. ""I'll have"
"him report to you at once."""
"He rose and held out his hand. ""I'm relying on you, Captain Bowen,"" he"
"said. ""I won't give any direct orders: use your own discretion. But I"
would advise you not to try to land in the red area. Simply fly low
"over it, and see what you can discern from the air. Good-by, and good"
"of your naval inquisitiveness."""
"Dawson told his story, and the naval officer's keen kindly face grew"
"stern and hard. ""Germans I can respect,"" said he, ""even those that"
pretend to be our friends. But one of our own folk--to sell us like
"this--ugh! Take the vermin away; Dawson, and stamp upon it."""
"We stood talking for a few moments, and then Dawson broke in with a"
"question. ""I have never understood, Admiral, why you were so very"
confident that Mr. Copplestone here had no hand in this business. The
"case against him looked pretty ugly, yet you laughed at it all the"
"time. Why were you so sure?"""
The Admiral surveyed Dawson as if he were some strange creature from
"an unknown world. ""Mr. Copplestone is a friend of mine,"" said he"
drily.
"""Very likely,"" snapped the detective. ""But is a man a white angel"
"because he has the honour to be your friend?"""
"""A fair retort,"" commented the Admiral. It happens that I had other"
and better reasons. For in July I myself showed Mr. Copplestone over
"the new battleship _Rampagious_, and after our inspection we both"
lunched with the builders and discussed her design and armament in
"every detail. So as Mr. Copplestone knew all about her in July, he was"
"not likely to suborn a draughtsman in November. See?"""
"""You should have told me this before. It was your duty."""
"""My good Dawson,"" said the Admiral gently, ""you are an excellent"
"officer of police, but even you have a few things yet to learn. I had"
"in my mind to give you a lesson, especially as I owed you some"
rather know that George had gone to Canada than to fear his return to
England under the circumstances.
"""The dastardly king will take his life if he comes,"" she said."
"""I admit the danger,"" I answered, as hopefully as possible, ""but I"
"believe, if George comes, he will be able to take care of himself."""
"""Danger!"" she exclaimed. ""It is certain death! George will find no"
"mercy."""
"""If he is caught,"" I answered. ""But the letter from King Louis will"
convince King Charles that Hamilton is in Canada and will throw our
jealous monarch off his guard. Perhaps Hamilton will be safer than we
"suppose. He speaks French like a Parisian, but, above all, he is cool,"
"calm, and thoughtful in danger. The London merchants will be far more"
"dangerous than the king."""
"""It does seem that we are guilty of treason to our country in thus"
"helping France,"" she said. Then laughingly, ""But I'll go back to the"
"palace at once and begin my task of wheedling the king."" She paused for a"
"moment, then continued hesitatingly, ""Do you suppose it possible that"
"George would doubt me afterwards?"""
"""Impossible,"" I answered, with emphasis that seemed to reassure her."
"""I am doing it for him,"" she continued with a sigh. ""God knows I would"
"do almost anything in the same cause. But I do not know men, and I fear"
it is possible that he will doubt me after I have succeeded. Let us go
"to see Betty. She is restful to me, and always soothes my nerves. But"
"besides, I want to have her help. I'll introduce her to the king--"""
"_never_ find my way back to mamma. Goodby, Miss Romley."""
"Behind Pola's back Mr. Dugald cast such a despairing, apologetic and"
altogether furious look toward Sidney as to make Sidney suddenly laugh.
And with her laugh all her sense of dismay and humiliation vanished.
She forgot her red hands and the big gingham apron and the dishes
spread about her in her amusement over Pola's pathetic attempt to be
very grown-up and sophisticated. And _so_ ill-bred! How ashamed Mr.
Dugald had been of her!
Then a thought struck Sidney with such force that she sat down in the
"nearest chair. Why, if Mr. Dugald was Pola's own cousin, belonged to"
"the grandeur that was Pola's, he would _never_ be attracted by poor,"
plain Trude. Her beautiful hopes were shattered! She felt distinctly
aggrieved.
"However, there was Vick. Sidney hated to give Mr. Dugald to Vick, who"
"always got everything, yet it seemed the only thing to do if any of the"
"sisters were to have him. Almost sadly she went to her room, opened her"
"satchel and took from it a small framed photograph of Victoria, a"
"photograph which, while it did not flatter Victoria, paid full justice"
"to her enticing beauty. Considering it, Sidney reflected on how lucky"
it was that at the last moment she had put the pictures of her sisters
into her baggage. Then she carried it to the kitchen and stood it on
the narrow mantel next to the clock where Mr. Dugald's eyes must surely
find it. Unlike the snapshot of Trude the picture remained there

"Perhaps she had spoiled everything. Pola would come back, of course,"
"but, somehow, Pola's glamour had faded. After all, what, besides tons"
"of candy and quarts of sweet mixtures and much glitter, had there been"
to it? The sweets and the glitter and Pola's endless confidences of
"""men"" had left Sidney jaded and bored, though she did not know it; she"
did know that she was suddenly lonely for Mart and Lav and the
stimulating pastimes they seemed to find always right at hand.
"As she approached Rockman's, wandering there from force of habit, she"
"saw Lav pushing off in a dory. She ran down the wharf, hailing him."
"""Oh, Lav, take me with you!"" she pleaded, breathlessly."
He hesitated a moment before he swung the dory back to the wharf.
Something of the look Mart had given her flashed into his eyes.
"Then: ""Come on if y'want to,"" he answered ungraciously."
As she sat down in the bow of the boat Sidney wanted to cry more than
"anything else, but Lav's dark face suddenly reminded her of what Aunt"
Achsa had told her. Perhaps he had been out in the sand dunes last
"night, lying on his face, sobbing aloud! She began chattering with"
resolute cheerfulness.
"""Isn't it hot this morning, Lav? Where are you going?"" Lav answered"
shortly that he was going out to the _Arabella_. Sidney noticed a book
"in his pocket, but said nothing. She ventured other remarks concerning"
"the activities in the bay to which Lavender answered in monosyllables,"
if at all.
"""Oh, look, the _Puritan's_ in, Lav!"" And even to this Lavender only"
"on his feet once more, pulling his clothes to rights, we looked at each"
"other. I had no wish to speak to him further, and left him. Besides, he"
was going away soon.
"After this, everything was dull and empty again. I went out alone, aping"
"myself and shouting: ""Bricks for the palace! The calf is much stronger"
"today!"" And when this was done, I did other nothings, and when my money"
"began to run out, I wrote to my publisher, pretending I would soon send"
"him an unbelievably remarkable manuscript. In short, I behaved like a man"
in love. These were the typical symptoms.
And to take the bull by the horns: no doubt you suspect me of dwelling on
the subject of Miss Torsen out of self-interest? In that case I must have
concealed well in these pages that I never think of her except as an
"object, as a theme; turn back the pages and you will see! At my age, one"
"does not fall in love without becoming grotesque, without making even the"
Pharaohs laugh.
*       *       *       *       *
_Finis._
"But there is one thing I cannot finish doing, and that is withdrawing to"
"my room, and sitting alone with the good darkness round me. This, after"
"all, is the last pleasure."
An interlude:
Miss Torsen and her actor are walking this way; I hear their footsteps and
"their voices; but since I am sitting in the dark of the evening, I cannot"
"see them. They stop outside my open window, leaning against it, and the"
"actor says something, asks her to do something she does not want to do,"
and a glass; but in the act of pouring out a drink for him there came a
"loud rap on the window, and quickly looking round she saw Rance's"
"piercing eyes peering into the room. For an instant she paled, but then"
there flashed through her mind the comforting thought that the Sheriff
"could not possibly see Johnson from his position. So, after giving the"
"latter his drink, she waited quietly until a rap at the door told her"
"that Rance had left the window when, her eye having lit on the ladder"
"that was held in place on the ceiling, she quickly ran over to it and"
"let it down, saying:"
"""Go up the ladder! Climb up there to the loft You're the man that's got"
"my first kiss an' I'm goin' to save you . . ."""
"""Oh, no, not here,"" protested Johnson, stubbornly."
"""Do you want them to see you in my cabin?"" she cried reproachfully,"
trying to lift him to his feet.
"""Oh, hurry, hurry . . .!"""
With the utmost difficulty Johnson rose to his feet and catching the
rounds of the ladder he began to ascend. But after going up a few rounds
"he reeled and almost fell off, gasping:"
"""I can't make it--no, I can't . . ."""
"""Yes, you can,"" encouraged the Girl; and then, simultaneously with"
"another loud knock on the door: ""You're the man I love an' you"
"must--you've got to show me the man that's in you. Oh, go on, go on,"
"jest a step an' you'll git there."""
"""But I can't,"" came feebly from the voice above. Nevertheless, the next"
"""By the time I'm through here, Sallie will be ready to go ashore."""
"Captain Dove looked very fiercely at him, but without effect."
"""Sallie won't stir a step from the ship,"" the old man affirmed, ""till"
"you've handed over the cash."""
"Slyne looked up, in mild surprise."
"""But, dear me! Dove,"" he remarked, ""you don't expect that the London"
lawyer's going to take my word for a girl he's never even seen? Until
"he's satisfied on that point, he won't endorse my note to you. So we've"
_got_ to take her along with us. I'm doing my best to give you a square
"deal; and all I ask in return is a square deal from you."""
"""You'd better not try any crooked games with me,"" growled Captain Dove,"
and sat for a time sunk in obviously aggravating reflections.
"""If we get on his soft side,"" suggested Slyne insidiously, ""there's no"
"saying how much more we might both make."""
Captain Dove rose and retired into his sleeping-cabin without further
"words; while Slyne, picking out with a two-pronged fork the cleanest of"
"the beans on his plate, smiled sneeringly to himself."
"""What's the latest long-shore fashion, Slyne?"" the old man asked after"
an interval. Slyne knew by his tone that he had dismissed dull care from
his mind and was prepared to be quarrelsome again.
"""It wouldn't suit a figure like yours,"" he answered coolly, and was"
"gratified to hear another hoarse growl. For, strange though it may seem,"
"Captain Dove was not without vanity. ""All you really need to worry about"
"""Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't know where the"
"hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London."""
"""My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb hit. My whole"
"body aches."" She groaned and plopped back down on the futon. ""What time"
"do you think it is?"""
"""Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?"" He felt for his"
"watch and realized it was gone. ""What does it matter anyway? Nobody has"
"clocks in never-never land."""
"Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room. Then he saw"
"what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated into"
"the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video"
camera.
And the music. Still the faint music.
He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another
"set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He"
"found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw"
"cypress. It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into"
"the floor. The water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and"
rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking.
"It was a traditional _o-furo_, one of the finest he'd ever seen."
"""You're not going to believe this."" He turned back and waved her"
forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly
disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
"""Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities."
"Check it out."""
type of singing.
Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is
considerably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
"secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches"
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing
"better. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special"
"services and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total"
work and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess
the strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of
the Eternal.
The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:
"_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine"
"Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not"
"all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth"
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many
of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use
"this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the"
"gospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous"
"song books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings."
"_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,"
"James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J."
"Kirkpatrick, and others."
"_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C."
"Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver."
It should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between

"And Kuvalda did not cease to belabour him with his tongue, as he"

"time.  At last he got up resolutely, and went to the door, leaving all"
"the papers on the bar, and saying to Vaviloff:"
"""Wait!  Don't lift them!"""
"Vaviloff gathered them up, put them into the cash-box, and locked it,"
"then felt the lock with his hand, to see if it were secure. After that,"
"he scratched his bald head, thoughtfully, and went up on the roof of"
the eating-house.  There he saw the Captain measuring the front of the
"house, and watched him anxiously, as he snapped his fingers, and began"
"measuring the same line over again. Vaviloff's face lit up suddenly,"
and he smiled happily.

precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether she had a title

"ROCHE, CAPTAIN PHILIP, _alias_ JOHN EUSTACE."
"In company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish"
"pirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,"
"for a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and"
"knowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in"
charge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took
"place, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,"
"who pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather"
"to Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and"
"disguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold"
"the cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly."
"The first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam"
alongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French
"port, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran"
"away. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and"
"disappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames."
"Later on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,"
"found guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,"
"at the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of"

smouldering links which the executioners had cast on the ground at his
"feet, shone upwards on his swollen lips and starting eyeballs. As I"
"looked, the body seemed to writhe in its bonds; but it was only the"

here I found three as ugly looking rogues whispering and peering in

So it had been a ruse after all! I went up sick at heart.
A low exclamation from Craig attracted my attention from Winters. In a
corner he had discovered a small box and had opened it. Inside was a
"dry battery and a most peculiar instrument, something like a little"
flat telephone transmitter yet attached by wires to earpieces that
fitted over the head after the manner of those of a wireless detector.
"“What’s this?” asked Kennedy, dangling it before Muller."
He looked at it phlegmatically. “A deaf instrument I have been working
"on,” replied the jeweler. “My hearing is getting poor.”"
Kennedy looked hastily from the instrument to the man.
"“I think I’ll take it along with us,” he said quietly."
"Winters, true to his instincts, had been searching Muller in the"
meantime. Besides the various assortment that a man carries in his
"pockets usually, including pens, pencils, notebooks, a watch, a"
"handkerchief, a bunch of keys, one of which was large enough to open a"
"castle, there was a bunch of blank and unissued pawn-tickets bearing"
"the name, “Stein’s One Per Cent. a Month Loans,” and an address on the"
Bowery.
"Was Muller the “fence” we were seeking, or only a tool for the “fence”"
higher up? Who was this Stein?
What it all meant I could only guess. It was a far cry from the wealth
"of Diamond Lane to a dingy Bowery pawnshop, even though pawnbroking at"
"one per cent. a month—and more, on the side—pays. I knew, too, that"
"diamonds are hoarded on the East Side as nowhere else in the world,"
"outside of India. It was no uncommon thing, I had heard, for a"

"""I am to see him to-night. That is why your visit was postponed until"

"""That is as I supposed,"" remarked the Abbé. ""Now, if I buy Dunkirk for"

"ten days after signing the treaty, and Baron Clyde will be my surety."""
"""Two thousand pounds?"" mused Lilly. ""That is rather a small sum in so"
"great a transaction."""
"""I doubt not the purchase may be made without the help of the stars if"
"you feel that two thousand pounds is too small a sum to be considered,"""
returned the Abbé.
"""No, no,"" said Lilly. ""I understand that you wish me to set a figure and"
"work out the solution of this affair, and if I learn from the stars that"
it is to King Charles's interest to accept your offer of one hundred
"thousand pounds for the city of Dunkirk, I am to receive--"""
"""If King Charles accepts!"" interrupted the Abbé."
"""Ah, I see! Yes, yes, of course,"" returned Lilly. ""I shall go to work"
immediately and set my figure. Of course I do not know what I shall
"learn, but I shall be glad to learn from the stars that which will enable"
me to advise the king according to your wishes. Two thousand pounds are
"two thousand pounds, and the word of a king is but a breath."""
"I jumped out and tried the door. It was locked, and I banged loudly"
without getting any answer. It would not do to lose an unnecessary

"and washing-basin behind that door, and did not intend to leave them"
"unused if I could help it, _chokidar_ or no _chokidar_. So, I took a"
"butting run with my shoulder, the door gave, and I set out in search"
of the water tub.
"An open door on my right showed me a small room, absolutely empty,"
except for a row of tins against the wall. Knowing that petrol was
carried in such tin drums I went and examined them. The next moment
"Allan heard a shout that brought him hastily inside, wondering"
"whether I had gone mad, had been bitten by a wild beast, or was"
being murdered.
"""Look!"" I cried, as he came running up to me. ""Look at those tins and"
"tell me what's inside!"""
"Allan seized hold of one of the drums, read what was written on it,"
"gave it a shake, and we could both hear the blessed sound of lapping"
inside.
"""It's petrol, sir,"" he whispered in an awed voice."
Petrol in the desert--petrol where one would as soon have expected to
find a Bond Street jeweller!
At first we could neither of us believe it. Personally I imagined we
"had both got temporary jim-jams, but Allan, with his usual stolid,"
"common sense, opened one of the drums, tested the contents, and"

response targets as they saw fit.
Then Wilson hit the sack to finish his off-duty.
"He dozed fitfully, but he did not sleep worth a damn. He would have"
been better off if he could have taken the controls of one of the
"spacers and gone out himself. Then, at least, he would have something"
to fill his mind and idle hands....
Alice Hemingway awoke from a rather pleasant dream that had something
"to do with either ice skating or skiing, or it might have been"
tobogganing--the dream had faded so fast she could not be sure--to face
the fact that she was feeling on the chill side.
"Her blanket had slipped. She caught it around her, and in minutes"
"felt fairly warm again. It was not so much, she thought, the actual"
"temperature in the lifeship, but the whole damned attitude of people,"
and everything else that was so chilling.
"The lights were running all right, and from deep below she could hear"
the ragged throb of the pedal generator. She wondered which of the two
men was pumping it this time.
"When Jock Norton came in, she knew. He was mopping his face with a"
"towel. He looked clean and bright, freshly shaved."
"She looked at him and wished she could have a hot shower herself, and a"
change of clothing. She wanted a ten-hour sleep in a nice soft bed with
"clean sheets, too, and wearing a silk-soft nightgown."
He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been split-second
up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.
"Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova, he"
realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far
"it was merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than"
he liked to think.
He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia. She
"obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the"
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried
"about the protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on,"
the KGB would have to work out their in-fighting back home the best way
they could. The ground rules were changing fast in Moscow.
"Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a previous life"
"for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd be"
set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean
"like Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis."
The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and Eva
Borodin.
"""Glad you could make it."" Vance glanced coldly at Vera. ""Right on time."
"The money arrives in exactly seven minutes."""
"She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter as she"
strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
"with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout."
They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the
"counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with"
"distinctly, though at that time, my poor friend, you were not a little"
"portly, and now you are a man shrunken."""
"""And my name?"" he asked, flattered that a beautiful woman should recall"
him so distinctly.
"""It is a strange name--Gatepath. An old English name redolent of the"
soil. Roger Gatepath. Your firm bears no prefix of initials and no
"suffix of company. You call yourselves Gatepaths. Just Gatepaths, as"
"though your status were territorial."""
"He crowed with pleasure. By an exercise in memory, Madame Gilbert had"
tied him to her chariot wheels.
"""Right!"" cried he. ""Right in every particular. You are the most"
"wonderful of women. For two minutes I spoke with you, and that was"
"nearly four years ago. I was one of a large party, an insignificant"
"lawyer lost in a dazzling company of titles. Yet you have remembered."""
Madame left the sense of flattery to soak in. She did not spoil the
impression that she had made by explaining that she would have
remembered a lackey with just the same accuracy.
"""And you, Madame?"" he asked. ""Have you been all these years doing war"
work with the Italian Red Cross? The years have passed and left no mark
"upon your face and figure. I, who comfortably filled out my clothes, am"
"shrunken, yet time and sorrow have spared you."""
"""Nevertheless, I have been pretty hard at work,"" said Madame briskly. ""I"
was present at that party ostensibly as an official of the Italian Red
Cross. In fact I was there to see that no harm befell the Royal
Personages who were in my charge. While we moved about those pleasant

"Once more I was run into a party of English, the last for this year."
They arrived by steamer in the morning and stopped at the trading station
"for a few hours, meanwhile sending up a detachment through the valley to"
"order a car to meet them. Stordalen, Stordalen, they said. So they had"
apparently not yet seen Stordalen--an omission they must repair at once.
And what a sensation they made!
They came across by rowboat from the trading station; we could hear them a
"long way off, an old man's voice drowning out all the others. Eilert"
"dropped everything he had in hand, and ran down to the landing place in"
"order to be the first on the spot. From Olaus's house, too, a man and a"
"few half-grown boys went down, and from all the houses round swarmed"
curious and helpful crowds. There were so many spectators at the landing
place that the old man with the loud voice drew himself up to his full
"height in the boat and majestically shouted his English at us, as though"
his language must of course be ours as well:
"""Where's the car? Bring the car down!"""
"Olaus, who was sharp, guessed what he meant and at once sent his two boys"
"up the valley to meet the car and hurry it on, for the Englishmen had"
arrived.
"They disembarked, they were in a great hurry, they could not understand"
"why the car had not come to meet them: ""What was the meaning of this?"""
"There were four of them. ""Stordalen!"" they said. As they came up past"
unknown to her. She would go back to the old world and the old circle of
it. What would happen after that she was too listless to think. It was
"summed up in negations; and these again melted into one great want, the"
absence of the man to whom her imagination and her heart blindly and
obstinately clung.
"Lady Eynesford had left her newspaper, and Alicia found her hand upon"
"it. Taking it up, she read Medland's evidence at the inquest. A sudden"
revulsion of feeling seized her. Was this the man she was dreaming
"about, a man who calmly, coolly, as though caring nothing, told that"
story in the face of all the world? Was she never to get rid of the
spell he had cast on her before she knew what he really was? For a man
"like this she had sacrificed her self-respect, bandied insults with a"
"vulgar upstart, and brought on her head a reproach more fitting for an"
ill-mannered child. She threw the paper from her and rose to her feet.
She would think no more of him; he might be what he would; he was no fit
"subject for her thoughts, and he and the place where he lived and all"
"this wretched country deserved nothing better than to be forgotten,"
"resolutely, utterly, soon."
"""I am very sorry, Mary,"" she was saying, ten minutes later; ""I deserved"
"all you said. I don't know what foolishness possessed me. See, I have"
"written and apologised to Mr. Coxon."""
And Lady Eynesford kissed her and thanked heaven that they would soon
have done with Mr. Coxon and--all the rest.
CHAPTER XXVI.
"""Oh--h, take me back to the cabin!"" moaned Pola."
"""I guess we might as well,"" muttered Mart. Their matches had been long"
since exhausted; they had been of little avail for the one ship's light
on the boat was without oil.
"One on each side of her, Mart and Sidney helped Pola down into the"
"cabin. The boat was rolling heavily now in the rough sea, each lift and"
drop sending terror to the three young hearts. In the blackness of the
night the waves looked mountain high. Even Mart was glad to shut them
from view.
"""If--if we're going to drown I'd rather drown in--a--room,"" gasped"
"Pola, clinging to Sidney and burying her face in Sidney's shoulder."
It seemed to the girls as though months had passed since Lav had
plunged to what they felt certain was his death. The _Arabella_ had
"tossed about on the roughening water like some wild thing, her old"
timbers creaking and groaning under their new living. Just at first
Sidney and Mart had been too concerned in quieting the panic-stricken
Pola to face their danger; not until Pola had exhausted herself did
they think of their possible fate.
"Unless Lav succeeded in reaching the beach and giving an alarm, they"
"might toss about for days or be dashed to pieces on some reef. Or,"
"worse fate, Jed Starrow and his gang might find the boat and--"
"""Wh-at are you thinking about, Mart?"" whispered Sidney after a long"
"time of silence, broken only by the howling of the wind and the"
"pounding of the water. ""Let's talk--and then we can't hear--"""
said:
"""You deserve to win, Boyd; you have made a good fight."""
"""Oh, I'll win!"" he declared, wearily. ""I've got to win; only I wish we"
"were past Port Townsend."""
"""What will happen to Fraser?"" she queried."
"""Nothing serious, I am sure. You see, they wanted me, and nobody else;"
once they find they have the wrong man I rather believe they will free
"him in disgust."""
"A moment later he went on: ""Just the same, it makes me feel depressed"
and guilty to leave him--I--I wouldn't desert a comrade for anything if
"the choice lay with me."""
"""You did quite right,"" Cherry warmly assured him."
"""You see, I am not working for myself; I am doing this for another."""
"It was the girl's turn to sigh softly, while the eyes she turned toward"
the west were strangely sad and dreamy. To her companion she seemed not
at all like the buoyant creature who had kindled his courage when it
"was so low, the brave girl who had stood so steadfastly at his shoulder"
"and kept his hopes alive during these last, trying weeks. It struck him"
suddenly that she had grown very quiet of late. It was the first time
"he had had the leisure to notice it, but now, when he came to reflect"
"on it, he remembered that she had never seemed quite the same since his"
interview with her on that day when Hilliard had so unexpectedly come
to his rescue. He wondered if in reality this change might not be due
to some reflected alteration in himself. Well! He could not help it.
"we are beginning to quarrel, Everard? It is slightly vulgar. I am your"
"oldest friend, remember, and I am trying to acquit myself of a painful"
duty to you.”
"“Duty is one of the chief instruments of the devil, if you will excuse"
"my saying so,” replied the Canon."
"“Oh, very well then, Everard,” she said hotly. “You can go on being"
a fool as long as you like. I saw your wife struggling in this man’s
"embrace, more or less, this morning. Two or three strange coincidences"
have been forced upon my notice. For your sake I have been excessively
"anxious. My conscience tells me I ought to take you into my confidence,"
and I can do no more. You can see the Christian name of this Bazouge
"in the Visitors’ List, and adopt what course of action you think fit."
I wash my hands of the whole matter. And I must say that from the very
"beginning, two years ago, you have treated me all through with the"
greatest want of consideration.”
The Canon did not heed the peroration. He stood with the flimsy sheet
"clenched in his hand and regarded her sternly. She shrank a little, for"
her soul seemed to be naked.
“You have tried to ferret this out through spite against Yvonne. Whether
"the horrible thing you imply is true or not, I shall find it hard to"
forgive you.”
"Mrs. Winstanley shrugged her shoulders. “In either case, you will come"
"to your senses, I hope. Meanwhile, considering the present relations, it"
might be pleasanter not to meet at dinner to-night.”
"“I am sorry to have to agree with you, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"we damned well need to know the inside story."""
"""Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask."" He winked. ""And if she's"
"the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm her up a little."
"Get her to drop her . . . guard."""
"""If you succeed in that, _moi droog_,"" he said as his heavy eyebrows"
"lifted with a sly grin, ""you'll be the envy of the facility. You've got"
"to see her."""
"""I can't wait."" He shrugged and moved on toward the Hangar Security"
"station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his A-level"
"priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made"
"a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly"
"well, before saluting and authorizing entry."
"That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly have all"
"this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about it,"
the big _nachalnik_ is on the scene.
Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff see the expression on
his face when the truth comes out. That's the real history we're about
to make here.
"As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had never"
"seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a"
"lot of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this."
"Still, he always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just"
more fancy iron. What really counted was the balls of the pilot holding
the flight stick.
"That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and gazing up. He"
"""And what's more,"" said Slyne, playing a trump card with great outward"
"indifference, ""you can make him pay you for your time instead of you"
paying him. I told you I came back here to do you a good turn. There's
more than a hundred thousand dollars of easy money for you in this
deal--if you go the right way about it.
"""But--don't take my word for anything."""
Captain Dove had palpable difficulty in suppressing the obvious repartee
to that last bit of advice. But cupidity and cunning kept him quiet for
a space.
"""All right. I'll go with you,"" he agreed very gruffly at last. And Slyne"
heaved a silent sigh of relief; he had feared more than once that the
contest of wills would after all go against him.
"""You're wise,"" he commented carelessly. ""It will pay you."
"""You'd better see Sallie now, don't you think, and tell her--"""
"""I'm not going to interfere between you and her--till I get my money"
"from you,"" declared the old man with a crafty grin. ""You must tackle her"
"yourself. She'll be up by now, but breakfast won't be ready for half an"
hour. If I were you I'd take that coat off and let her have a sight of
"those diamonds of yours."""
"Slyne did not wait to hear any more. He was already on his way aft, a"
somewhat incongruous figure on the decks of the _Olive Branch_. When he
reached the companion-hatch on the poop he was smiling sardonically.
"""I do believe it was my 'diamonds' that finally fetched that old"
"The little withered lady, all pleased excitement, said: “_Quite_"
"thrilling, James!”"
"Pangbutt seeing awkwardness at the door, and missing the loud"
"announcement of names, went a few paces closer to it to meet his"
newly-arrived guests.
"The little old gentleman entered the room vaguely, the dandruff of"
"the philosophic habit upon his coat-collar, and his wig full of"
reasons--very markedly a professor. He had the air of cataloguing
"ideas. The little old lady, a couple of paces behind him, followed him."
Pangbutt exchanged greetings with him.
Said the professor:
"“Good-evening, sir; my sister’s husband’s brother-in-law, Sir Gilders"
"Persimmon, was good enough to say that you would allow me to meet"
Mr. Anthony Bickersteth here.... I am writing a work to disprove
the insanity of genius.... It is a part of my theory that the human
personality cannot be hidden by artifice--that the strong temperament
shows itself in the vigorous growth of the hair--and so on.... I
"am, sir, I may have forgotten to say, Professor Curtis.... I am an"
"inveterate novel-reader.... My wife keeps a diary.... Where are you,"
"Charlotte? Ah, yes. But, fervently as I admire Mr. Bickersteth’s prose,"
I should like to suggest to him that in his next work he might make
"more of that unworked mine, the folk-lore of the London coster--or"
greengrocer.... I am most anxious that Mr. Bickersteth should be a
virile person whose moustache springs out strongly from under the
"nostrils, with a tendency towards ruddiness in the colouring.... But"
"I fear that on this--what I may call his--er,” he tittered--“his"
was glad to see Frances.

"During the first week of Bettina's illness she was too sick to talk,"
therefore we did not remain long with her. But as she grew better our
"visits lengthened, and my poor resolutions grew weaker day by day because"
my love for the girl was growing stronger and stronger hour by hour.
"On one occasion while Frances's back was turned, Betty impulsively"
"snatched up my hand and kissed it, dropping it instantly, blushing"
intensely and covering her tracks by humming the refrain of a French
"lullaby. I longed to return the caress, but did not, and took great"
credit to myself because of my self-denial. Betty understood my sacrifice
"and appreciated it, feeling sure that she need not thereafter restrain"
herself for the purpose of restraining me.
During those times I was making an honest effort to do the right by this
beautiful child-woman and to save my own honor unsullied from the sin of
making her unhappy for life through winning her love beyond her power to
"recall; and my effort toward the right, like all such efforts, achieved"
at least a part of the good for which I strove.
"One day after our visit to Betty's room, Frances asked me to take her to"
"see George. I suspected that she had seen him frequently, but was not"
"sure. I objected, but changed my mind when she said:--"
"""Very well. I prefer going alone."""
I shall not try to describe the scene between them. We found George
"alone, and she sprang to him as the iron springs to the magnet."
Louis XIV because of a too great friendliness for one of the king's
"sweethearts, and was living in exile in London till Louis should forgive"
his interference. The French king really liked De Grammont and trusted
"him when his Majesty's lady-loves were not concerned, so the count had"
"been sent to England in honorable exile, and was employed in certain"
cases as a spy and in others as a means of secret communication between
the French king and persons connected with the court of Charles II.
"When De Grammont saw me, he came forward, holding out both hands in his"
"effusive French manner, apparently overjoyed at finding a long-lost"
brother.
"""Come with me, my dear baron,"" he cried, bending so close to me that I"
"feared he was going to kiss me. ""Come with me! You are the very man of"
"all the world I want, I need, I must have!"""
"""You have me, my dear count,"" said I, ""but I cannot go with you. I am"
"engaged elsewhere."""
"""No, no, let me whisper!"" He brought his lips close to my ear and"
"continued almost inaudibly: ""You may please me. You may help a friend."
"You may oblige--a king."""
"The last, of course, was the _ne plus ultra_ of inducement according to"
"the count's way of thinking, and he supposed the mere suggestion would"
"vanquish me. Still I pleaded my engagement. He insisted, however,"
repeating in my ear:--
"""Oblige a king! A real king! Not a flimsy fool of bourgeois, who makes of"
"himself the laughing-stock of his people, but a real king. I cannot name"
"him now, but you must know."""
"“It was only natural on my part,” she said amiably. “I shall never"
"forget when poor Flossie died. You remember Flossie, don't you? She used"
"to look so pretty, with her blue bow in her hair, and no one will ever"
persuade me that she was n't poisoned by the people next door; they were
dreadful people. I wish I could remember their name; it was something
"like Blunks. Anyhow, I was inconsolable, and Mrs. Tawley asked me to"
stay with her to get over it. I shall never forget how grateful I
"was. I'm sure you 're looking quite poorly, John,” she added in her"
inconsequent way. “Let me get you a cup of tea. It will do you good.”
"John declined. He wanted to accomplish his errand, but the longer he"
"remained in the company of this lady devoid of the sense of values, the"
more absurd did that errand seem. A less obstinate man than he would
"have abandoned it, but John had made up his mind to act on Herold's"
"suggestion, although he mentally bespattered the suggester with varied"
"malediction. He rose and, making his way between the flimsy chairs and"
"tables, stood on the hearth-rug, his hands in his pockets. Unconsciously"
"he scowled at his placid and smiling aunt, who remained seated on the"
"couch, her helpless hands loosely folded on her lap."
“Did you ever hear of a child called Unity Blake?”
“Was that the girl--”
“Yes.”
“What an outlandish name! I often wonder how people come to give such
names to children.”
"“Never mind her name, my dear aunt,” said John, gruffly. “I want to tell"
you about her.”
"Alicia huddled herself in a heap on the sofa, turning her face to the"
wall. She felt Lady Eynesford's scornful rebuke like the stroke of a
"whip. She had descended to a vulgar wrangle, and had been worsted in it:"
the one thing of all which it concerned her to hide had by her own act
been opened to the jeer of a stranger; she had violated every rule of
good breeding and self-respect. No words--not even Lady
Eynesford's--were too strong to describe what she had done. Yet she
could not help it; she could not hear a creature like that abuse or
"condemn a man like Medland--though all that he had said she had said,"
"and more, to Medland himself. She was too miserable to think; she lay"
"with closed eyes and parted lips, breathing quickly, and restlessly"
moving her limbs in that strange physical discomfort which great
unhappiness brings with it.
"A footstep roused her; she sat up, hurriedly smoothing her hair and"
clutching at a book that lay on the table by her. The intruder was her
"brother, and fortunately he was too intent on the tidings he brought to"
notice her confusion.
"""Great news, Al!"" he cried. ""They've offered me Ireland. We shall start"
"home in a month."""
"""Home in a month?"" she echoed."
"""Yes. Splendid, isn't it?"""
"""You're pleased, Willie?"""
"The Governor was very pleased. He liked the promotion, he liked going"
"home; and finally, pleasant as his stay in New Lindsey had been on the"
"whole, there were features in the present position which made him not"
sorry to depart.
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
"those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices"
"within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three"
"coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking"
"about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning"
"their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had"
assumed another form.
"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said"
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.
"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first"
"and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard."""
"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of"
"them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two"
"others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,"
"and sink the ship with every man on board."""
"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the"
"day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"""
once more asked the captain's wife.
"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others."
"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is"
"used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our"
"lives!"""
There was nothing more to be done till day-break. They had played their
"last card, and now they must wait to see what cards were out against"
"them, and who should win the final trick at the hour of sunrise."
"Rollo fell asleep again. And so soundly this time, that he only woke to"
consciousness when a soldier in a white _boina_ pulled roughly at his
"elbow, and ordered him to get up."
"All about the granary the Carlists were stamping feet, pulling on boots,"
and flapping arms.
"""It's a cold morning to be shot in,"" said the man, with rough"
"kindliness; ""but I will get you some hot chocolate in a moment. That"
"will warm your blood for you, and in any case you will have a quick"
passage. I will pick you a firing party of the best shots in the three
"provinces. The general will be here in a quarter of an hour, and the sun"
will rise in another quarter. One is just as punctual as the other. A
"cigarette?--thank you. Well, you are a cool hand! I'm off to see about"
"the chocolate!"""
"And Rollo Blair, with a slight singing in his ears, and a chill"
"emptiness about the pit of his stomach, stood on his feet critically"
rolling a cigarette in a leaf of Etienne's Alcoy paper.
"John Mortimer said nothing, but looked after the man who had gone for"
the chocolate.
"""I wish it had been coffee,"" he said; ""chocolate is always bad for my"
"digestion!"""
Then he smiled a little grimly. His sufferings from indigestion produced
by indulgence in this particular chocolate would in all probability not
pillowed on her arm. Her hair spread as in a dusky halo beneath it.
Her bosom moved with the rhythmic calm of dreamless sleep. Her lips
were parted in a smile. One hand was hid in the dark folds of her
robe.
"Francesco knelt with upturned face, his eyes shut to the sky. He"
seemed like one faint with pain; his lips moved as in prayer. A
hundred inarticulate pleadings surged heavenward from his heart.
Again he bent over her and watched the pure girlish face as she slept.
A strange calm fell for a time upon him; his eyes never wavered from
the white arm and the glimmering hair. Vast awe held him in thrall. He
"was as one who broods tearless and amazed over the dead, calm face of"
one beloved above all on earth.
"Hours passed and Francesco found no sustenance, save in prayer. The"
unuttered yearnings of a world seemed molten in his soul. The moon
waned. The stars grew dim. Strange sounds stirred in the forest-deeps;
the mysterious breathing of a thousand trees. Life ebbed and flowed
with the sigh of a moon-stupored sea. Visions blazed in the night-sky
and faded away.
Hours passed. Neither sleeper nor watcher stirred. The night grew
faint. The water flickered in the mere. The very stars seemed to gaze
upon the destinies of two wearied souls.
Far and faint came the quaver of a bird's note. Gray and mysterious
stood the forest spires. Light! Light at last! Spears of amber darting
in the east. A shudder seemed to shake the universe. The great vault
kindled. The sky grew luminous with gold.
It was the dawn.
"“If you can explain,” he began rather stiffly, “why you—”"
"“Dear,” she interrupted, “listen. It was an hour’s pain and trial to"
you. I did it for her—I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I
"was so happy, Jim—so happy with you that I didn’t dare to refuse that"
"happiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning—those"
two; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you
I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That’s
"all of it, dear—I had to do it.”"
Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in
the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By
rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings. But bride
knoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between them swiftly passes
comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.
THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER
"Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,"
allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually
expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half
past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy
"“Good-morning, Pitcher,” Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were"
"intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of"
letters and telegrams waiting there for him.
The young lady had been Maxwell’s stenographer for a year. She was
beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the
cheek glared at the duke from under his upreared arm. So close were
they that blood spattered in the duke's face as the Frangipani blew
the red stream from his mouth and beard.
"[Illustration: ""'They lied,' he cried. 'Give me but life.'""]"
"The duke broke away, wheeled and came again. He lashed home, split the"
Frangipani's collar-bone even through the rags of his hauberk. The
"Frangipani yelped like a gored hound. Rabid, dazed, he began to make"
blind rushes that boded ill for him. The swords began to leap and to
"sing, while blinding flashes of lightning followed each other in quick"
succession and thunder rolled in deafening echoes through the heavens.
"Cut and counter-cut rang through the night, like the cry of axes,"
whirled by woodmen's hands.
Suddenly the Frangipani parried an upper cut and stabbed at the duke.
The sword point missed him a hair's breadth. Before he could guard the
"duke was upon him like a leopard. Both men smote together, both swords"
met with a sound that seemed to shake the rocks. The Frangipani's
blade snapped at the hilt.
"He stood still for a moment as one dazed, then plucked out his poniard"
"and made a spring. A merciless down cut beat him back. His courage,"
"his assurance seemed to ebb from him on a sudden, as though the blow"
"had broken his soul. He fell on his knees and held up his hands, with"
"a thick, choking cry."
"""Mercy! God's mercy!"""
"""Curse you! Had you pity on your victims?"""
Thunder crashed overhead; the girdles of the sky were loosed. A
"“They’re mighty good guns,” he said hesitatingly. “Seems a shame to"
throw ’em away like this.”
Bainbridge returned briefly: “I’m simply pulling the stings of this
gang.”
"He watched his man fling the weapons, one after another, into the"
"stream, and then, sending the automatic splashing after the others, he"
turned suddenly back to the six humiliated individuals before him.
"“Go!” he commanded, with a momentary flare of passion. “Beat it, and"
don’t let me set eyes on you again--understand? I won’t be so easy on
"you the next time. Here, take that scum with you. He’s only stunned.”"
"He waited, staring from under lowered lids, until the gang had"
"disappeared in the bushes, half dragging, half carrying their stunned"
"leader with them. Then, with a long sigh, he turned slowly and smiled at"
Peters.
"“All right, Jack,” he said quietly. “I don’t think we’ll have any more"
trouble here. Just hustle all you can to make up for this delay.”
"Peters grinned, and snapped out some orders to the men which sent them"
flying along the bank and even out on the stream over the tumbling logs.
"But as they went they cast glances of open, unadulterated admiration at"
"the young man coolly brushing a bit of mud from one shoulder, and their"
comments to each other left no trace of doubt of their thorough approval
of everything he had said and done.
"Bob heard some of them, and when the men had gone on he smiled a bit. To"
get that drive down successfully he knew he must have the men with him.
“Cardinal Spada is a very intelligent man and a very amiable one. At
"heart he is a Liberal and fond of the French. As to the Abbé Tardieu, he"
is a very influential priest at the church of San Luigi.”
After lunch they went direct to a solitary street in the old part of
"Rome. At the door of the big, sad palace where Cardinal Spada lived, a"
"porter with a cocked hat, a grey greatcoat, and a staff with a silver"
"knob, was watching the few passers-by."
"They went in by the broad entry-way, as far as a dark colonnaded court,"
paved with big flags which had grass between them.
In the middle of the court a fountain shot up a little way and fell into
a stone basin covered with moss.
Kennedy and Cæsar mounted the wide monumental stairway; on the first
floor a handsome glassed-in gallery ran around the court. The whole
house had an air of solemnity and sadness. They entered the Cardinal’s
"office, which was a large, sad, severe room."
"Monsignor Spada was a vigorous man, despite his age. He looked frank"
"and intelligent, but one guessed that there was a hidden bitterness and"
desolation in him. He wore a black cassock with red edges and buttons.
"Kennedy went close and was about to kneel to the Cardinal, but he"
prevented him.
Cæsar explained his ideas to the Cardinal with modesty. He felt that
this man was worthy of all his respect.
"Monsignor Spada listened attentively, and then said that he understood"
"nothing about financial matters, but that on principle he was in favour"
disappointed when the smile with which she greeted me was the same she
would have given to any other man. But Mary was Mary. Nature and art had
"made her what she was--charming, quiescent, and calm, not cold, simply"
lukewarm.
"""I have seen little of you this last month,"" said Mary, taking my arm and"
walking with me away from De Grammont's group. She might have remarked
with equal emotion that Cromwell was dead or the weather fine. She did
"not wait for an explanation of my absence, but continued with a touch of"
"eager hesitancy and a fluttering show of anxiety, ""Have you had news"
"recently of my brother George?"""
"Of course I could not tell her the truth, so I answered evasively: ""I"
suppose you have heard the news spread throughout the court that he has
"gone to Canada? Doubtless you can tell me more than I know."""
"""That is all I know,"" she answered. ""When he went, or where, I have been"
"unable to learn, for George is a forbidden topic in our household and"
"seems to be the same at court. What has he done, baron? I have heard it"
hinted that he threatened to take the king's life. Surely he did nothing
"of the sort."""
"""If he did, it was in a delirium of fever,"" I answered, hoping that she"
would cease speaking of George and would ask a question or two concerning
myself.
"But no. She turned again to me, asking, ""Did you hear him?"""
"""I have been told that the accusation comes from his physician, and"
"perhaps from one who was listening at his door,"" I answered, avoiding a"
direct reply.
"""You have need of better marksmen,"" he said; ""even the Migueletes could"
"not do worse than that!"""
"""Who are you?"" demanded a tall grey-headed gipsy, who like the Sergeant"
"had remained apparently unarmed; ""what is your right to be here?"""
The Sergeant had by this time seated himself on a detached boulder and
was rolling a cigarette. He did not trouble to look up as he answered
"carelessly, ""To the Gitano my name is José Maria of Ronda!"""
The effect of his words was instantaneous. The men who had been ready to
"kill him a moment before almost fell at his feet, though here and there"
some remained apparently unconvinced.
Prominent among these was the elderly man who had put the question to
the Sergeant. Without taking his eyes from those of the Carlist soldier
"he exclaimed, ""Our great José Maria you cannot be. For with these eyes I"
"saw him garrotted in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca!"""
The Sergeant undid his stock and pointed to a blood-red band about his
"neck, indented deeply into the skin, and more apparent at the back and"
sides than in front.
"""Garrotted in good faith I was in the Plaza of Salamanca, as this"
"gentleman says,"" he remarked with great coolness. ""But not to death. The"
"executioner was as good a _Gitano_ as myself, and removed the spike"
which strikes inward from the back. So you see I am still José Maria of
"Ronda in the flesh, and able to strike a blow for myself!"""
The gipsies set up a wild yell. The name of the most celebrated and most
lawless of their race stirred them to their souls.
she 'll have to earn her living as a little slave in some squalid
Household. But what's going to become of that human creature morally and
spiritually? That's what I want to know.”
"“It's an interesting problem,” said Herold. “She may be either a"
"benumbed half-idiot or a vicious, vindictive she-brute.”"
"“Just so,” said John. “That is, if she goes to slave in some squalid"
household. But suppose she were transferred to different surroundings
"altogether? Suppose she had ease of life, loving care, and all the rest"
of it?”
The senile travesty of Herold laughed.
“You want me to say that she may develop into some sort of flower of
womanhood.”
"“Do you think she might?” John asked seriously. “My dear fellow,” said"
"Herold, “there are Heaven knows how many hundred million human beings"
"on the face of the earth, and every one of them is different from the"
others. How can one tell what any particular young woman whom one does
n't know might or might not do in given circumstances? But if you want
me to say whether I think it right for you to step in and look after the
"poor little devil's future, then I do say it's right. It 's stunning of"
you. It's the very best thing you can do. It will give the poor little
"wretch a chance, at any rate, and will give you something outside"
yourself to think of.”
"“I was going to do it whether you thought it right or not,” said Risca."
"Herold laughed again. “For a great, hulking bull of a man you 're"
"sometimes very feminine, John.”"

"""You speak in enigmas, Yolande.  Why not be more explicit?"""
"Her pale lips trembled, her eyes were brimming with tears, her chilly"
"hand quivered in mine.  She did not speak for some moments, but at last"
"said in a low, tremulous voice half choked by emotion:"
"""Once you loved me, Gerald,--of that I feel confident; and I"
"reciprocated your affection, God knows!  Our love was, perhaps, curious,"
inasmuch as you were English and I was of a different creed and held
different ideas from those which you considered right.  It is always the
same with a man and woman of different nationality--there must be a
"give-and-take principle between them.  Between us, however, there was"
"perfect confidence until, by a strange combination of circumstances--by"
a stroke of the sword of Fate--that incident occurred which led to our
"estrangement."""
"She paused, her blanched lips shut tight.  ""Well?""  I asked, ""I am all"
attention.  Why is it too late now for me to make reparation for the
"past?"""
I loved her with all my soul.  I was heedless of those words of the old
"Baronne, of Anderson's suspicions, and Kaye's denunciation.  Even if she"
"were a spy, I adored her.  The fire of that old love had swept upon me,"
"and I could not hold back, even though her touch might be as that of a"
leper and her lips venomous.
"""Reparation is impossible,"" she answered hoarsely.  ""Is not that"
"sufficient?"""
"""No, it is not sufficient,"" I answered clearly.  ""I will not be put off"
"by such an answer."""
Kuvalda in such cases came to their assistance with his philosophy.
"""Don't lose your temper, brothers, everything has an end, this is the"
"chief characteristic of life.  The winter will pass, summer will follow"
"... a glorious time, when the very sparrows are filled with rejoicing."""
But his speeches did not have any effect--a mouthful of even the
freshest and purest water will not satisfy a hungry man.
Deacon Taras also tried to amuse the people by singing his songs and
"relating his tales.  He was more successful, and sometimes his"
endeavours ended in a wild and glorious orgy at the eating-house.  They
"sang, laughed and danced, and for hours behaved like madmen.  After"
"this they again fell into a despairing mood, sitting at the tables of"
"the eating-house, in the black smoke of the lamp and the tobacco; sad"
"and tattered, speaking lazily to each other, listening to the wild"
"howling of the wind, and thinking how they could get enough vodki to"
deaden their senses.
"And their hand was against every man, and every man's hand against them."
PART II.
"All things are relative in this world, and a man cannot sink into any"
"condition so bad that it could not be worse. One day, towards the end"
"of September, Captain Aristid Kuvalda was sitting, as was his custom,"
"on the bench near the door of the dosshouse, looking at the stone"
building built by the merchant Petunikoff close to Vaviloff's
"eatinghouse, and thinking deeply.  This building, which was partly"
"surrounded by woods, served the purpose of a candle factory."
"his side, with relaxed, enormous limbs, on the hearth-rug, lifted his"
"massive head for a second and glanced at John. Then with a half-grunt,"
"half-sigh, he dropped his head, and twitched his limbs and went to sleep"
again.
"“Now and then when you 're not looking at me,” said Stellamaris, “there"
is a strange look in your eyes: it is when you 're not speaking and you
stare out of window without seeming to see anything.”
For a moment Risca was assailed by a temptation to break the Unwritten
"Law and tell her something of his misery. She, with her superfine"
"intelligence, would understand, and her sympathy would be sweet. But he"
put the temptation roughly from him.
"“I am the happiest fellow in the world, Stellamaris,” said he."
“It would be difficult not to be happy in such a world.”
She pointed out to sea. The blustering wind of the day before had
"fallen, and a light breeze shook the tips of the waves to the"
"morning sunshine, which turned them into diamonds. The sails of the"
fishing-fleet of the tiny port flashed merrily against the kindly blue.
On the horizon a great steamer was visible steaming up Channel. The
salt air came in through the open windows. The laughter of fishermen's
children rose faintly from the beach far below.
"“And there's spring, too, dancing over everything,” she said. “Don't you"
feel it?”
"He acknowledged the vernal influence, and, careful lest his eyes should"
"betray him, talked of the many things she loved. He had not seen her for"
"a fortnight, so there were the apocryphal doings of Lilias and Niphetos"
"Across the granary John Mortimer reclined with his head in his hands,"
making vows never to enter Spain or trust himself under the leadership
"of a mad Scot, if this once he should get clear off."
"""It isn't the being shot,"" he moaned; ""it's not being able to tell them"
"that I'm not a fool, but a respectable merchant able to pay my way and"
"with a balance at William Deacon's Bank. But it serves me right!"" Then a"
"little inconsequently he added, ""By gum, if I get out of this I'll have"
"a Spanish clerk in the works and learn the language!"""
Which was John Mortimer's way of making a vow to the gods.
"Etienne, having his hands comparatively free, and finding himself"
"sleepless, looked enviously at Rollo's untroubled repose, and began to"
twist cigarettes for himself and the sentry who guarded his side of the
granary.
"Without, the owls circled and cried. A dog barked in the village above,"
"provoking a far-reaching chorus of his kind. Then blows fell, and he"
fled yelping out of earshot.
Rollo was not wholly comfortable on his couch of grain. The bonds about
"his feet galled him, having been more tightly drawn than those of his"
companions in virtue of his chiefship. Nevertheless he got a good deal
"of sleep, and each time that he awoke it seemed to him that El Sarria"
was staring harder at the sentry and that the man had moved a little
nearer.
"At last, turning his head a little to one side, he heard distinctly the"
low murmur of voices.
“Will it make you happy to promise?”
“Yes.”
"“Then I promise,” said Joyce, humouring him. “Now I’m not going to talk"
to you any more.”
"A few minutes later, his breathing told Joyce that he slept. The"
"newspapers fell from Joyce’s hand, and he put his elbows on his knees"
and crouched over the smouldering logs. Noakes spoke truly. There was
little chance of recovery. He would be left alone again soon. It would
be very comfortless. The poor wreck who was dragging out his last days
upon that wretched bed had been an unspeakable solace to him. Without
his womanlike devotion he would have died of fever six months back on
"the Arato goldfield. Without the influence of his calm fatalism, he"
would have given up heart long ago. Without his steadfast purity of
"soul, he would have gone recklessly to the devil. The thought of losing"
him was a great pang.
"He himself, too, was far from strong. The climate, the hard manual"
labour for which he was physically unfit were telling upon him heavily.
"He yearned for home, for civilised life, for the lost heritage of"
"honour. Yvonne’s letter, telling of the little commonplaces of the lost"
"sweet life of decent living, had revived the ever dormant longing. He"
"began to dream of her, of that last day he had seen her, of her voice"
singing Gounod’s serenade.
"It was difficult to picture her as married to his cousin Everard, whom,"
"in the days of his vanity, he had despised as a prig and now dreaded as"
a scornful benefactor. It was a strange mating. And yet she seemed happy
and unchanged.
"""I want to go to Siberia ...  I have had enough of this vile life ..."
"one learns how to live there!"""
"""Yes, they have a particularly good way of teaching in Siberia,"" agreed"
"the Captain, sadly."
"They spoke no more of Petunikoff, or of the turning out of the"
inhabitants of the dosshouse.  They all knew that they would have to
"leave soon, therefore they did not think the matter worth discussion."
"It would do no good, and besides the weather was not very cold though"
the rains had begun ... and it would be possible to sleep on the ground
anywhere outside the town.  They sat in a circle on the grass and
"conversed about all sorts of things, discussing one subject after"
"another, and listening attentively even to the poor speakers in order"
to make the time pass; keeping quiet was as dull as listening.  This
"society of ""creatures that once were men"" had one fine"
characteristic--no one of them endeavoured to make out that he was
"better than the others, nor compelled the others to acknowledge his"
superiority.
The August sun seemed to set their tatters on fire as they sat with
their backs and uncovered heads exposed to it ... a chaotic mixture of
"the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms. In the corners of the yard"
the tall steppe grass grew luxuriantly....  Nothing else grew there but
"some dingy vegetables, not even attractive to those who nearly always"
felt the pangs of hunger.

The following was the scene that took place in Vaviloff's eating-house.
"Young Petunikoff entered slowly, took off his hat, looked around him,"
"""And I will take a stone and hit you on the head,"" the young man"
answered respectfully.
"Martyanoff would have broken his bones, had not Kuvalda interrupted"
with:
"""Leave him alone....  Is this a home to you or even to us? You have no"
sufficient reason to break his teeth for him.  You have no better
"reason than he for living with us."""
"""Well, then, Devil take him! ...  We all live in the world without"
"sufficient reason....  We live, and why?  Because!  He also because ..."
"let him alone...."""
"""But it is better for you, young man, to go away from us,"" the teacher"
"advised him, looking him up and down with his sad eyes. He made no"
"answer, but remained.  And they soon became accustomed to his presence,"
"and ceased to take any notice of him.  But he lived among them, and"
observed everything.
"The above were the chief members of the Captain's company, and he"
"called them with kind-hearted sarcasm ""Creatures that once were men."""
For though there were men who had experienced as much of the bitter
"irony of fate as these men, yet they were not fallen so low.  Not"
"infrequently, respectable men belonging to the cultured classes are"
"inferior to those belonging to the peasantry, and it is always a fact"
that the depraved man from the city is immeasurably worse than the
depraved man from the village.  This fact was strikingly illustrated by
the contrast between the formerly well-educated men and the mujiks who
were living in Kuvalda's shelter.
The representative of the latter class was an old mujik called Tyapa.
“Of course it is--a delightful one--to see dear Yvonne and yourself.
Where are you staying?”
"“At the Océan,” said the Canon, “and you must all come and dine with us"
this evening.”
“And will you come to the _bal_ here afterward?” asked Sophia. “Evan has
run across some college friends--or won’t you think it proper?”
"“I am going to wear the whole suit of motley while I am here,” replied"
the Canon gaily.
"He kept his word, not being a man of half measures. No check should be"
"placed on Yvonne’s enjoyment. She had been moping, as far as Yvonne could"
"mope, during the latter dullness of Fulminster; now she expanded like a"
flower to the gaiety around her. The Canon found an aesthetic pleasure
in watching her happiness. Her expressions of thanks too were charmingly
"conveyed. Since that unfortunate attempt on his part, over a twelvemonth"
"back, to instruct her in the responsibilities of her position, she had"
never exhibited toward him such spontaneous feeling. He let her smile
"upon whom she would, without a twinge of jealousy."
Yvonne enjoyed herself hugely. She danced and jested with the young men;
"she chattered in French to her table d’hôte neighbours, delighted to"
speak her mother’s tongue again; she staked two-franc pieces on the
"public table, and one afternoon came out of the gaming-room into the"
"great hall where the Canon was sitting with Mrs. Winstanley, and poured"
a great mass of silver on to the table--as much as her two small hands
joined could carry.
"“I thought gambling was against your principles, Everard,” said Mrs."
"""Aren't you?"" she repeated, more sweetly imperious."
"""You bet,"" I stammered."
"""Then do hurry! It's almost ten, and I've been waiting such a long"
"time!"""
"Whereupon I heard her moving off, pressing her hands against the panels"
"for steadiness, and there struck me as having been an endearing pathos"
"in the way she said: ""such a long time!"""
"This was, no doubt, some of Tommy's doing. He had invited friends aboard"
"for luncheon, and was now daring one of them to play this joke. But my"
"glance turned to the room, to its equipment and toilette articles which"
"were large and curiously shaped, and the numbing truth crept into my"
brain that the stupid boatman had put me on the wrong yacht.
"I had known some tight places in France, but this one simply squeezed me"
"all over. There was nothing for it, of course, but go out and"
explain--yet how could a chap appear at noon draped in a sheet! The
"situation confused me, but I decided to search the wardrobe, of my"
"unknown host, to borrow his razor, appropriate a new toothbrush that"
"should be found in a box somewhere, and select flannels and linens in"
keeping with the hour. Still balanced between confusion and panic I must
"have done these things because, fittingly attired though with no very"
"good fit, I opened my door, stepped softly along the passageway, and"
entered the cabin.
On a wide couch built in at one side a girl lay reading. Her head was
"toward me, but as I advanced she arose with a low cry of gladness,"
saying:
station to catch their train.
"It was a cold, clear, frosty night, and the Strand was at its busiest as"
Sallie looked out at it from the taxi into which Slyne and Ambrizette
"had followed her at the hotel portico. Another, containing Captain Dove"
"and their legal adviser, still on the most amicable terms, although"
"Captain Dove as a rule could not stand anyone afflicted with hiccough,"
"crawled close behind them through the turmoil until, at the Gaiety"
"corner, a policeman delayed it to let the cross-traffic through."
A crowd had gathered there to gaze at the royalties who would presently
be coming out of the theatre. Slyne drew Sallie back from the open
"window at sight of two men, one of whom seemed all shirt-front, looking"
down at the congested street from the empty steps of the principal
entrance.
"""That ass Ingoldsby!"" he explained to Sallie, and was evidently a good"
"deal disturbed. ""And--Dubois, as well,"" he added. ""I thought I had"
"shaken him off in Paris. I'm sure he saw me, too."""
A little farther on he stopped the taxi and beckoned to one of those
street-arabs who make a living about the kerb.
"""Go to the gentleman with the beard, on the steps of the Gaiety,"" he"
"instructed that very alert messenger, ""and say to him that a friend"
"wants a word with him here."""
Sallie observed the suppressed grimace of surprise on the face of the
individual who almost at once arrived in the wake of his ragged Mercury:
"and Slyne, having tossed the latter a shilling, held out his hand to M."
Dubois.
a prolonged war.
But the immediate reality became too overwhelming. Grey multitudes were
"sweeping khaki multitudes before them. High-explosives, shrapnel,"
"grenades, bombs, bullets were rending, piercing, and shattering the"
living flesh and muscle and bone. Towns and villages were being turned
"into heaps of brick and wreckage. Hordes of old men, women, and children"
"were thronging the roads, and fleeing from approaching disaster."
"We went to work as usual although we worked less than usual, for we now"
had something to talk about. Would the Germans reach the coast? If they
"did, then the northern armies would be cut off and destroyed. A general"
retreat from our front might be ordered at any moment. We stood in
groups and discussed these problems hour by hour.
One day we were returning from work and passing through the village. A
"crowd of civilians was standing round the window of the Mairie, where a"
"written notice was exposed. An old woman dressed in black was moaning,"
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu."" The '19, '20, and '21 classes had been"
called up.
Then the German advance came to an end. A French army had arrived and
saved the situation. The shelling of the back areas had ceased. The
danger was over for a time.
Had the Germans assembled all their strength for one supreme attempt at
breaking through the Western Front? Or was it only the beginning of a
whole series of operations?
"One morning, as we woke up, we heard the roar and rumble of a"
"bombardment. We did not take much notice of it, for we had heard the"
sound so often.
"their hearts as water within them. Their pet Valiant, old Gaspar Perico,"
"too, had judiciously hidden himself. Esteban the supple had accompanied"
"him, and the venta of Sarria was in the hands of the silent,"
"swift-footed, but exceedingly capable maid-servant who had played the"
trick upon Etienne.
"The Sarrians therefore watched the mill-house blaze up, and thanked God"
that it stood some way from the other dwellings of the place.
Suddenly Cabrera turned upon them.
"""Hearken ye, villagers of Sarria,"" he cried, ""I have burned the home of"
a traitor. If I hear of any shelter being granted to Luis Fernandez or
"his brother within your bounds, I swear by the martyred honour of my"
mother that on my return I will burn every house within your walls and
shoot every man of you capable of bearing arms. You have heard of Ramon
"Cabrera. Let that be enough."""
"The villagers got apprehensively behind each other, and none answered,"
"each waiting for the other, till with mighty bass thunder the voice rang"
out again:
"""Have you no answer?"" he cried, ""no promise? Must I set a dozen of you"
"with your backs against the wall, as I did at Espluga in Francoli, to"
"stimulate those dull country wits of yours?"""
Then a young man gaily dressed was thrust to the front. Very unwilling
"he was to show himself, and at his appearance, with his knees knocking"
"together, a merry laugh rang out from behind Cabrera."
That chieftain turned quickly with wrath in his eye. For it was a sound
"of a woman's mirth that was heard, and all such were strictly forbidden"
"""Don't waste your breath on them,"" Boyd advised. ""We're lucky enough as"
"it is. If that tug hadn't sheered off she would have cut us down, sure."""
"""That fellow done it a-purpose,"" George swore. ""Seamen ain't that"
"careless. He tried to tell me he was rattled, but I rattled _him_."""
"""If that's the case they may try it again,"" said the younger man."
"""Huh! I'll pack a 'thirty-thirty' from now on, and I bet they don't get"
"within hailing distance without an iron-clad."""
"The more calmly Emerson regarded the incident, the more he marvelled at"
"the good-fortune that had saved him. ""We had better wake up,"" he said."
"""We have been asleep so far. If Marsh planned this, he will plan"
"something more."""
"""Yes, and if he puts one wallop over we're done for,"" George agreed,"
"pessimistically. ""I'll keep a watchman aboard the scows hereafter."
"That's our vital spot."""
"But the days sped past without further interference, and the"
"construction of the plant progressed by leaps and bounds, while _The"
"Bedford Castle_, having discharged her cargo, steamed away to return in"
August.
"The middle of June brought the first king salmon, scouts sent on ahead"
"of the ""sockeyes;"" but Boyd made no effort to take advantage of this"
"run, laboring manfully to prepare for the advance of the main army,"
"that terrific horde that was soon to come from the mysterious depths,"
"either to make or ruin him. Once the run proper started, there would be"
no more opportunity for building or for setting up machinery. He must
be ready and waiting by the first of July.
"most amazing new life, had put the past with all its horrors resolutely"
"behind her, was too much interested in the entertaining present to"
trouble about the future at the moment.
"Captain Dove had seemingly forgotten, for the time being at any rate,"
"his grievance against Slyne, and was in his most lamb-like mood. While"
Slyne did not even demur against the quantities of expensive wine the
"old man consumed during dinner. Mr. Jobling, too, was displaying"
symptoms of convivial hilarity when they at length left the restaurant.
But most of the other tables were empty by then.
"Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, arm in arm, affectionately maintained each"
"other as far as their sitting-room, while Slyne accompanied Sallie to"
"her own door. He had been making himself most agreeable to her, and had"
pointed out a number of the notorieties and one or two of the
celebrities present; although it had somewhat startled her to be told
that she would very soon be on familiar terms with them all.
"""Aren't you glad now that you agreed to the bargain we made on the"
"_Olive Branch_--and in Monte Carlo?"" he asked by the way. He was smiling"
gaily.
"She smiled back at him, and, ""I'm not sorry--so far, Jasper,"" she"
"answered, looking deep into his eyes."
"He nodded, as if quite satisfied, and turned away to escape that"
embarrassing scrutiny.
"""We'll be starting in half an hour or so,"" he informed her from a safe"
"distance, and, ""I'll be all ready,"" she called cheerfully after him."
A little before eleven he came in again and they all set out for the
and serene in her undisputed position. In her childish days her material
kingdom was limited to the walls of her sea-chamber but as the child
"expanded into the young girl, so expanded her conception of the limits"
of her kingdom. And with this widening view came gradually and curiously
the consciousness that though her uncle and aunt were exquisitely
"honoured and beloved agents who looked to the welfare of her realm,"
yet they could not relieve her of certain gracious responsibilities.
"Instinctively, and with imperceptible gradations, she began to make"
her influence felt in the house itself. But it was an influence in the
spiritual and not material sense of the word; the hovering presence and
not the controlling hand.
"When, shortly after the arrival of the two men, Walter Herold went up to"
"his room, he found a great vase of daffodils on his dressing-table and"
"a pencilled note from Stella in her unformed handwriting, for one cannot"
learn to write copper-plate when one lies forever on the flat of one's
back.
"_Great High Favourite: Here are some daffodils, because they laugh and"
dance like you. Stellamaris._
And on his dressing-table John Risca found a mass of snowdrops and a
note:
_Great High Belovedest: A beautiful white silver cloud came to my window
"to-day, and I wished I could tear it in half and save you a bit for the"
palace. But snowdrops are the nearest things I could think of instead.
Your telegram was a joy. Love. S._
Beside the bowl of flowers was another note:
"_I heard the wheels of your chariot, but Her Serene High-and-Mightiness"
"enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow, the press package ready."
Then we drop it on the papers and blow town.
"From the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the elevator opened,"
a private lift that came directly up from the lobby. When he heard the
"heavy footsteps of the couriers, accompanied by MNB guards, he stepped"
over and quickly glanced out. The two blue-suits were each carrying a
large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist. Obviously the third had
"stayed downstairs, guarding the van."
"""This way."" The heavy-jowled director of the MNB bond trading desk"
stepped out and motioned them in. The play was on.
Kenji Nogami's issue of Mino Industries debentures had been registered
with the Issuing House Association the previous day. This morning they
"would be acquired by Vance, using a wire transfer between the Moscow"
Narodny Bank on Saint Swithins Lane and Westminster Union Bank's bond
"desk. After that there would be a second transaction, whereby Sumitomo"
"Bank, Limited would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one"
"hundred million dollars, to be wire-transferred back to Westminster"
Union and from there to Moscow Narodny Bank. Everything had been
prearranged. The whole transaction would require only minutes.
Unless there was a glitch.
Vance had fully expected that Tanzan Mino would send a welcoming
"committee to Nogami's premises, which was why he'd arranged for the"
money to be delivered here at Moscow Narodny's side-street branch. He
"figured the Soviets, at least, would play it straight. KGB wanted its"
file closed.
"Then too, Eva still had the protocol. Their back-up insurance policy."
"And from that day, a year and a half ago, there has been keen"
competition among the inhabitants of the dosshouse as to which can
"swear the hardest at the merchant.  And last night there was a ""slight"
"skirmish with hot words,"" as the Captain called it, between Petunikoff"
and himself.  Having dismissed the architect the merchant approached
the Captain.
"""What are you hatching?"" asked he, putting his hand to his cap, perhaps"
"to adjust it, perhaps as a salutation."
"""What are you plotting?"" answered the Captain in the same tone. He"
moved his chin so that his beard trembled a little; a non-exacting
person might have taken it for a bow; otherwise it only expressed the
desire of the Captain to move his pipe from one corner of his mouth to
"the other.  ""You see, having plenty of money, I can afford to sit"
"hatching it.  Money is a good thing, and I possess it,"" the Captain"
"chaffed the merchant, casting cunning glances at him.  ""It means that"
"you serve money, and not money you,"" went on Kuvalda, desiring at the"
same time to punch the merchant's belly.
"""Isn't it all the same?  Money makes life comfortable, but no money,"""
... and the merchant looked at the Captain with a feigned expression of
"suffering.  The other's upper lip curled, and exposed large, wolf-like"
teeth.
"""With brains and a conscience, it is possible to live without it. Men"
only acquire riches when they cease to listen to their conscience ...
"the less conscience the more money!"""
"""Just so; but then there are men who have neither money nor conscience."""
"desire to visit it, and she, finding him entirely unsympathetic, had"
handed him over to her subordinate. “None of them know what gratitude
"is. As soon as they get out of here, they forget everything that has"
"been done for them; and as for coming back to pay their respects, or"
"writing a letter even, they never think of it.”"
"Kitchen, utensils, floors, walls, dormitory, orphans--all were"
"spotlessly clean, the orphans sluiced and scrubbed from morning to"
night; but of things that might give a little hint of the joy of life
there was no sign.
"“This is the infirmary,” said the matron, with her hand on the"
door-knob.
"“I should like to see it,” said John."
"They entered. An almost full-grown orphan, doing duty as nurse, rose"
"from her task of plain sewing and bobbed a curtsy. The room was clean,"
"comfortless, dark, and cold. Two pictures, prints of the Crucifixion"
"and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, hung on the walls. There were three"
"narrow, hard beds, two of which were occupied. Some grapes on a chair"
beside one of them marked the patient in whom he was interested. John
noticed angrily that some flowers which he had sent the day before had
been confiscated.
"“This is the gentleman who has been so kind to you,” said the matron."
"Unity Blake looked wonderingly into the dark, rugged face of the man who"
stood over her and regarded her with mingled pain and pity. They had not
"told her his name. This, then, was the unknown benefactor whose image,"
"like that of some elusive Apollo, Giver of Things Beautiful, had haunted"
her poor dreams.

"Occasionally he had landed--always staying close to the space ship,"
"for Jupiter's gravity made movement a slow and laborious process, and"
he didn't want to be caught too far from security. At such times he
might hear a crashing and splashing and see a reptilian head loom
gigantically at him through the fog. Then he would discharge the
"deadly explosive gun which was Earth's latest weapon, and the creature"
would crash to the ground. The chorus of hissings and bellowings would
"increase as he hastened slowly and laboriously back to the ship,"
indicating that other unseen monsters of the steamy jungle had flocked
to tear the dead giant to pieces and bolt it down.
"Oh, Jupiter was a nice planet! mused Brand. A sweet place--if one"
happened to be a two-hundred-foot snake or something!
"He had always thought the entire globe was in that new, raw, marshy"
state. But he had worked only in one comparatively small area of the
northern hemisphere; had never been within thirty thousand miles of
"the red spot. What might lie in that ominous crimson patch, he could"
"not even guess. However, he reflected, he was soon to find out, though"
he might never live to tell about it.
"Shrugging his shoulders, he turned into the fifty story building in"
"which was his modest apartment. There he found, written by the"
"automatic stylus on his radio pad, the message: ""Be with you at seven"

"The letter continued, “I am happy to say, however, that I have a"
prophylactic which will destroy any number of these germs if used up to
the ninth day. It is necessary only that you should place five thousand
dollars in an envelope and leave it for me to be called for at the desk
"of the Prince Henry Hotel. When the messenger delivers the money to me,"
the prophylactic will be sent immediately.
"“First of all, take a match and burn this letter to avoid spreading the"
disease. Then change your clothes and burn the old ones. Enclosed you
will find in a germ-proof envelope an exact copy of this letter. The
room should then be thoroughly fumigated. Do not come into close
contact with anyone near and dear to you until you have used the
"prophylactic. Tell no one. In case you do, the prophylactic will not be"
"sent under any circumstances. Very truly yours, DR. HANS HOPF.”"
"“Blackmail!” exclaimed Kennedy, looking intently again at the gelatine"
"on the second page, as I involuntarily backed away and held my breath."
"“Yes, I know,” responded Mrs. Blake anxiously, “but is it true?”"
There could be no doubt from the tone of her voice that she more than
half believed that it was true.
"“I cannot say—yet,” replied Craig, still cautiously scanning the"
apparently innocent piece of gelatine on the original letter which Mrs.
Blake had not destroyed. “I shall have to keep it and examine it.”
On the gelatine I could see a dark mass which evidently was supposed to
contain the germs.
"“I opened the letter here in this room,” she went on. “At first I"
"“Lady from the Stenographer’s Agency to see about the position,” said"
Pitcher.
"Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker"
tape.
"“What position?” he asked, with a frown."
"“Position of stenographer,” said Pitcher. “You told me yesterday to"
call them up and have one sent over this morning.”
"“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” said Maxwell. “Why should I have"
given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect
satisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as
"long as she chooses to retain it. There’s no place open here, madam."
"Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don’t bring any"
more of ’em in here.”
"The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself"
independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed.
Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the “old man”
seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor
they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell’s customers
were heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going as
swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were
"imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,"
"strong machine—strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate,"
"never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and"
"prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and"
"securities—here was a world of finance, and there was no room in it for"
He knew also that deliberate planning could not have accomplished that
result half so well as this encounter with the tools of the Lumber
"Trust. The whole affair had proved a great piece of luck for him,"
thought the young lumberman. His meditation was broken in upon by the
sound of a strange voice.
“I had no idea lumbering was such a strenuous occupation.”
"A moment later Bainbridge was looking into a pair of pleasant, friendly"
eyes set in the handsome face of a man of about fifty. He was roughly
"dressed in well-worn, but finely made fishing clothes, and carried a"
"good trout rod in one hand. There was, too, about the stranger an air of"
forceful capability which attracted the younger man.
"“It’s not usually quite so full of incident,” said Bob; “but I don’t"
believe you’d ever find it exactly tame.”
"The stranger smiled, and made a comprehensive gesture with his hands."
"“And this is your idea of incident,” he murmured whimsically. “I should"
call it something decidedly stronger.”
"He hesitated for an instant, then moved closer to Bob."
"“You’re going downstream, aren’t you? Do you mind if I walk along with"
you? My camp’s down that way.”
Bainbridge acquiesced readily. There was something very taking about the
"stranger, and within ten minutes he found himself chatting as if to an"
"old friend. His companion turned out to be Wolcott Sears, of Boston, on"
a two weeks’ trip in the Maine woods. The name was only vaguely
"familiar, but Bob felt sure from his manner that he was a man of"
affairs. He was tremendously interested in hearing all about the
CHAPTER LXXXVI
"_Wherein our Hero, and Another, go Home_"
The sunlight that had painted the white face of Paris with a hundred
hues all day had given place to a gentle drizzle as the twilight fell;
and the steady downpour had driven Noll into a restaurant which he was
not in the habit of frequenting; it had kept him there in its bright
rooms until he knew every face and every trick of gesture of the people
who sat about him.
The night was well advanced when he sallied out into the light rain;
"turning up his collar, he strode homewards."
He paid small heed to the rain; and as he turned out of the well-washed
"street into the courtyard where he had his lodging, and climbed the"
"stairs to his room, he scarcely noticed that he was wet."
"The rustle of women’s petticoats was in his ears, and when he walked"
abroad in these days he was aglow with the sense of the warm regard
"of women’s eyes, that glanced upon him from the dark shadows of"
rakish hats; the walk and movement of women found a rhythmic echo in
his thinking. The warmth of the coming summer was in his blood. His
instincts were jigging to the dancing measure of the season.
As he flung off his wet clothes he was seized with a whim to go to the
tavern of _The Golden Sun_; and he decided to humour the whim.
He lit a candle and flipped through a book until it was close on
midnight. But he was restless--and he arose eagerly when it was time to
"pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or"
lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to
"luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with"
fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the
gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly
"radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow,"
"her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence."
"Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this"
"morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her"
"desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once"
"she moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near enough for him to be aware of"
her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New
"York broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs."
“Well—what is it? Anything?” asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail lay
"like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye,"
"impersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently."
"“Nothing,” answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile."
"“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the confidential clerk, “did Mr. Maxwell say"
anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?”
"“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He told me to get another one. I notified"
the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning.
"It’s 9.45 o’clock, and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple"
chewing gum has showed up yet.”
"“I will do the work as usual, then,” said the young lady, “until some"
"hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no"
nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At
the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three
"days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,"
"where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,"
apparently well.
"Two days later the temperature rose to 104°, and enteric fever"
"was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing."
The patient made a good recovery.
"(173) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), at junction of"
outer 2/5 with inner 3/5 of line from right anterior superior
"iliac spine to umbilicus; _exit_, at upper part of right great"
"sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac"
spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept
"fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a"
half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the
"bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became"
"constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of"
three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now
again on active service.
(174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. _Entry_
"(Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; _exit_, 2-1/2"
inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The
"injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained"
confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the
abdomen' when micturition was performed.
When the patient came under observation on the third day the
"condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,"

"United Kingdom, the Re-captors may nevertheless institute Proceedings"
"against the Ship or Goods in the High Court of Admiralty, and the Court"
"may thereupon award Prize Salvage as aforesaid to the Re-captors, and"
"may enforce Payment thereof, either by Warrant of Arrest against the"
"Ship or Goods, or by Monition and Attachment against the Owner."

which penetrated the sheltering walls out into the night where fifty
men writhed in a death-struggle with hundreds--saw every bleeding
"wound, heard every smothered moan of pain, felt already the cold iron"
"pierce their own breasts. The hours passed, and they did not yield."
"They had ceased from their incongruous tasks, and stood and waited,"
wordless and tearless.
As the first grey lights of dawn crept into the stifling room they
"heard footsteps hurrying across the adjacent room, and each drew"
herself upright to meet the end. Mrs. Carmichael's hand tightened over
"the revolver, but it was only Mr. Berry who entered. The little"
"missionary, a shy, society-shunning man, noted for doing more harm"
than good among the natives by his zealous bigotry and ignorance of
"their prejudices, stood revealed in a new light. His face was grimed"
"with dirt and powder, his clothes disordered, his weak eyes bright"
with the fire of battle.
"""Do not be afraid,"" he said quickly. ""There is no immediate danger. I"
have only been sent to warn you to be ready to leave the bungalow. The
"front wall is shot-riddled, and the place may become indefensible at"
"any moment. When that time comes, you must slip out to the old"
"bungalow. Nicholson believes he can hold out there."""
"""My husband--?"" interrupted Mrs. Carmichael."
"""Your husband is safe. In fact, all three were well when I left. If I"
"wasn't against such things, I should say it was a splendid fight--and"
"every man a hero. The Rajah--"""
"""The Rajah--?"""
Mr. Berry looked in stern surprise at the pale face of the speaker.

But they were presently delivered from their difficulty by the newly
nominated commander-in-chief himself.
"""This scene is painful to me,"" said Señor Muñoz, placidly, ""it irritates"
my nerves. I have a headache. I think I shall retire and leave these
gentlemen to make such arrangements as may be necessary till the return
"of our guards, which will doubtless take place within an hour or so. If"
"you need me you can call for me!"""
Having made this general declaration he turned to Rollo and addressed
himself particularly to him.
"""My rooms, I would have you know, are in the north wing,"" he continued;"
"""I beg that there shall be no firing or other brutal noise on that"
"side. Anything of the kind would be most annoying. So pray see to it."""
"Then he advanced to where his wife stood, her eyes full of anger at this"
desertion.
"""My angel,"" he said, calmly, ""I advise you sincerely to do the same."
Retire to your chamber. Take a little _tisane_ for the cooling of the
"blood, and leave all other matters to these new friends of ours. I am"
sure they appear very honest gentlemen. But as you have many little
"valuables lying about, do not forget to lock your door, as I shall mine."
"Adieu, my angel!"""
And so from an inconceivable height of dandyism his Excellency the Duke
of Rianzares would have stooped to bestow a good night salutation on his
"wife's cheek, had not that lady, swiftly recovering from her stupor,"
"suddenly awarded him a resounding box on the ear, which so far"
discomposed the calm of his demeanour that he took from his pocket a
"money, Slyne. Where is she? Fetch her in here."""
"Slyne had no farther to go to do that than to the next room, where he"
"found Sallie at the window, gazing pensively out at the sea. But he"
delayed there for some time to make it still more clear to her that her
only hope of helping herself lay in abetting him blindly.
"When he at length returned to his own sitting-room with her, he found"
"Captain Dove staring fixedly at another arrival there, an overwhelmingly"
"up-to-date if rather imbecile-looking young man, whose general"
"gorgeousness, combined with a very vacant, fish-like eye much magnified"
"by a monocle, had evidently reduced the would-be fashionable seaman to a"
stricken silence.
"Slyne, who had at first shot a most malevolent glance at the intruder,"
was stepping forward to greet him just as Mr. Jobling put in an
appearance with a sheaf of papers in one hand.
"""How d'ye do, Lord Ingoldsby?"" said Slyne quite suavely to the young man"
"with the eye-glass. He had caught sight of Mr. Jobling in the doorway,"
"and turned to Sallie, his quick mind bent on a masterstroke."
"""May I introduce to you the Marquis of Ingoldsby,"" he remarked to her in"
"the monotone of convention; and, as she bowed slightly in response to"
"that very modern young gentleman's ingratiating wriggle and grin, Slyne,"
"one eye on Captain Dove's astonished countenance, completed the"
formality.
"""This is Lady Josceline Justice,"" said he to his smirking lordship, and"
breathed delicately into a somewhat extensive ear the further
"information, ""the late Earl of Jura's daughter, you know--and my"
"_fiancée_."""
Mr. Jobling sank still lower in his seat.
"""In return for that,"" Slyne went on, ""he must sign a clear deliverance"
"from any further claim on any of us, subject, of course, to due payment"
of the note.
"""Then, I want a document drawn up to confirm my engagement to the girl"
and granting me the fullest possible power of attorney on her behalf
both before and after our marriage. She's so simple and inexperienced
that I must do everything for her.
"""And, lastly, you'd better make out a brief private agreement between"
"yourself and me--just as a matter of form, you know--to the effect that"
"you are willing to act in my interests throughout, in return for a"
commission of ten per cent. on the accumulated revenues of the Jura
"estates at the date of my marriage."""
Mr. Jobling looked at him for a time as a man suddenly bereft of his
spine might.
"""There's no time to spare,"" Slyne mentioned. ""I want all that sort of"
thing settled right off the reel--before lunch.
"""If the old man makes any kick about anything, you must back me up in"
all I say. Although if he tries to raise his price by a few thousand
"dollars, we needn't stick at that. The great thing is to get him to sign"
"the deliverance in return for our note. The girl has already agreed--"""
"""And what if _I_ refuse?"" croaked his companion with the courage of"
desperation. It was evident that Mr. Jobling saw through his daring
"scheme. ""What if I insist on my fair share? What if I--"""
"A month later I received a letter from George, written in cipher, which I"
here give translated:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""I reached Paris three weeks ago and was received by Monsieur Le G."
"most graciously. Although I cannot give definite news, I hope for great"
"improvement in my fortune soon, and perhaps may write you more fully"
thereof before the week is spent.
"""Good fortune has but one meaning for me, of which you already know. I"
beg you to say to one that a letter from her hand would give me greater
"joy than she can know, and that I would now send one to her if I felt"
"safe in so doing. Please send all letters in cipher, addressed: 'Monsieur"
"le Blanc, in care of 'Sieur de Catanet, at the sign of the Double Arrow"
"on the Rue St. Antoine, counting nine doors from the street corner"
nearest the Bastile.'
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"When George wrote that he hoped for good fortune, I knew he had"
"sound reason to expect it, for he was one who never permitted a mere"
"possibility to take the form of hope, nor hope, however assuring, to"
"take the aspect of certainty. Knowing this to be true, I found great"
"joy in the letter, and when I told Frances, she did not pause even to"
"give me one smile of thanks, but broke into a flood of tears and seemed"
to take great happiness in her tribulation.
"I told Frances that we should answer the letter at once, and suggested"
"that she have hers ready in my hands the following day, if she wished to"
"With a choked, inarticulate outcry the duke snatched bow and arrow"
"from the nearest sentry, and ere the Pisan could grasp the meaning of"
"what he saw, or prevent, he set and sped the bolt. A moan died on the"
"stillness. A form collapsed, shuddered and lay still."
"The duke dropped bow and arrow, staring like a madman, then rushed"
towards the prostrate form.
"Bending over it, a moan broke from his lips, as he threw his arms"
"about the lifeless clay of her he had loved in the days of yore, ere"
the honeyed treachery of the Frangipani had sundered and broken their
lives. The woman of the Red Tower had expiated her guilt.
He saw at once that no human agency might here avail. Death had been
instantaneous. The arrow had pierced the heart.
"The duke knelt long by her side, and the strong man's frame heaved"
"with convulsive sobs, as he closed the eyes and muttered an Ave for"
her untimely departed soul.
"When he arose, he looked into the pale face of Francesco, whose"
blood-stained sword and garments told a tale his lips would not. He
"understood without a word. Silently he extended his hand to the duke,"
"then, taking off his own mantle, he covered therewith the woman's"
body.
It was midnight when the Pisans and the duke's men groped their way
cautiously down the steep winding path to the shore. The Pisans made
"for their ships and Spoleto's men for the dusk of their native woods,"
carrying on a hurriedly constructed bier the body of the woman of the
Red Tower.
lacked the strength that was needed to run counter to all. I was no
"knight-errant, but a plain man, and I reeled on through the last hour"
"of the night and the first grey streaks of dawn, with my head on my"
breast and sobs of despair in my throat.
CHAPTER XXV.
NUREMBERG.
If it had been our fate after that to continue our flight in the same
"weary fashion we had before devised, lying in woods by day, and all"
"night riding jaded horses, until we passed the gates of some free"
"city, I do not think that I could have gone through with it. Doubtless"
it was my duty to go with my lady. But the long hours of daylight
"inaction, the slow brooding tramp, must have proved intolerable. And"
"at some time or other, in some way or other, I must have snapped the"
ties that bound me.
"But, as if the loss of my heart had rid us of some spell cast over us,"
"by noon of that day we stood safe. For, an hour before noon, while we"
"lay in a fir-wood not far from Weimar, and Jacob kept watch on the"
"road below, and the rest slept as we pleased, a party of horse came"
"along the way, and made as if to pass below us. They numbered more"
"than a hundred, and Jacob's heart failed him, lest some ring or buckle"
of our accoutrements should sparkle and catch their eyes. To shift the
"burden he called us, and we went to watch them."
'Do they go north or south?' I asked him as I rose.
"""Sounds like raving, sonny. Who the dickens is Basil the Wolf? No, Jack,"
"that doesn't tell us anything."""
"""It tells us he couldn't have been inspired like that unless the place"
"and people were real to him!"""
"""Well, pirate or priest,"" Tommy laughed, ""he'll do if he waltzes us up"
"to the big adventure. You're about fit enough to tackle one now!"" During"
the past forty-eight hours he had openly rejoiced with Gates at my
"improvement and tried, with the indifferent success of an unbeliever, to"
play up at top speed that silly idea of an approaching adventure.
"We had strolled aft, and now stopped to watch a tall Jamaica negro--or"
so we thought him to be--asking Gates for a place in the crew. His
"clothing was too scant to hide the great muscles beneath, and Tommy"
"touched my arm, saying:"
"""There's a specimen for you!"""
"Had he been cast in bronze a critic might have said that the sculptor,"
"by over-idealizing masculine perfection, had made the waist too small,"
"the hips too slender, for the powerful chest and shoulders; the wrists"
and ankles might have been thought too delicate as terminals for the
"massive sinews leading into them. He smiled continually, and spoke in a"
"soft, almost timid voice."
"""I like that big fellow,"" I said. Perhaps I had been well called a"
"pantheist, having always extravagantly admired the perfect in form or"
face or the wide outdoors.
"Feeling my interests he turned from Gates, looking at me with dog-like"
pathetic trustfulness. Among the things he told us briefly--for the crew
"ordering, but that they shall not. On every breach of her vigorous laws"
Nature waits with weaponed hand. At the elbow of every vice stands
foul-breathed disease.
There is no sin in the love of man and woman. The woman has committed
no sin in loving--she has but accepted the overwhelming urging of life.
It is her chiefest glory. Man has committed no sin in loving; his life
has ordered it; and the Masterfolk obey life. It is his chiefest glory.
Who so glum a dullard but smiles to see lovers meeting! But he sins
"foully who is guilty of the repudiation--foully against the woman,"
"criminally against his race, blasphemously against his godhood, and"
damnably against his manhood. Such are not of the Masterfolk.
"They of the inferior manhood, lacking in the force of character"
necessary to the full acceptance of the duties of the Masterfolk in
"love, have not the virile force to abide by a woman of the Masterfolk;"
and these come out when the lamps are lit and there are shadows in the
"land, and skulk about the by-lanes, and commit mean adulteries with"
"frail women, and have the habit of repudiating debt. Such cannot breed"
the Masterfolk. They shall not. For these cower from the strengthening
risks that dog a strenuous life; they would have the delight of
marriage without the courage....”
Noll opened the window.
There came from the street below the hoarse cry of a prostitute.
"He went into the room, lit a candle, and sat down at his desk."
Everything in the place whispered of Betty this night.
He wrote a letter:
"drama and epic, lyric and sonnet.  He could speak of Poetry as one who"
had loved and courted her as a mistress.  The girl longed to ask him if
"he had written himself, but maiden shyness withheld her.  Yet her eyes"
"brightened as she talked, and the peach-like colour rose and deepened in"
"her cheeks; and Lord Sandford, turning back once again from the mother"
"to look at the daughter, was struck dumb with admiration and delight."
"""There is a rose worth winning and wearing, though the stem may not be"
"free from a sharp thorn,"" he said to himself; and Lady Romaine, who"
chanced to catch sight of Geraldine during a shifting of the admirers
"who surrounded her, gave something very like a start, and felt a curious"
thrill run through her in which pride and envy were blended.
"""Gracious!  I did not know I had so handsome a daughter!  I must wed her"
"as fast as may be, else shall I find my beaux going from me to her,"" was"
"her unspoken thought; and aloud she said, tapping Lord Sandford with her"
"fan, ""Pray tell my daughter that I am about to depart.  We have had"
"enough of the naiads and dryads, and I am tired and hungry.  Who will"
"come home with me to supper—to take pot-luck with us?"""
There was an eager clamour in response; but when the supper-party
assembled round Lady Romaine’s chocolate tables in her favourite private
"parlour, she noted that Geraldine had disappeared to bed, and that Sir"
Grey Dumaresq had not availed himself of her open invitation.

"purifying yourself from the lust of life, you will come unto that lake"
where all desire shall be washed away.
CHAPTER XX
'NOBLESSE OBLIGE'
"'Sooner shall the cleft rock reunite so as to make a whole, than"
may he who kills any living being be admitted into our
society.'--_Acceptance into the Monkhood._
It is very noticeable throughout the bazaars of Burma that all the beef
"butchers are natives of India. No Burman will kill a cow or a bullock,"
and no Burman will sell its meat. It is otherwise with pork and fowls.
Burmans may sometimes be found selling these; and fish are almost
"invariably sold by the wives of the fishermen. During the king's time,"
any man who was even found in possession of beef was liable to very
"severe punishment. The only exception, as I have explained elsewhere,"
"was in the case of the queen when expecting an addition to her family,"
"and it was necessary that she should be strengthened in all ways. None,"
"not even foreigners, were allowed to kill beef, and this law was very"
"stringently observed. Other flesh and fish might, as far as the law of"
"the country went, be sold with impunity. You could not be fined for"
"killing and eating goats, or fowls, or pigs, and these were sold"
"occasionally. It is now ten years since King Thibaw was overthrown, and"
"there is now no law against the sale of beef. And yet, as I have said,"
no respectable Burman will even now kill or sell beef. The law was
"founded on the beliefs of the people, and though the law is dead, the"
The late-night security team had listened sympathetically. They had no
objection if Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage of
"_Daedalus /, _then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in"
"the dead of night. Everybody knew he was eccentric. No, make that"
insane. You'd have to be to want to ride a rocket. They'd just waved
"him in. After all, the classified avionics in the forward bays were"
secured.
He smiled grimly to think that he'd been absolutely right. Hangar
Control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the
big test. It always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping
in and out.
That also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic access cards
"for all the sealed forward bays. Just as he'd figured, the mechanics"
were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they kept
in their lockers in the changing room.
Time to get started.
"There was, naturally, double security, with a massive airlock port"
"opening onto a pressure bay, where three more secure ports sealed the"
"avionics bays themselves. The airlock port was like an airplane door,"
"double reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space, and in the"
center was a green metallic slot for a magnetic card.
"He began trying cards, slipping them into the slot. The first, the"
"second, the third, the fourth, and then, payoff. The three green diodes"
above the lock handle flashed.
"He quickly shoved down the grip and pushed. The door eased inward, then"
"rotated to the side, opening onto the pressure bay."
he who is laughing at the others.
“The other day he said to me in his macaronic Italian:
"“‘Mr. Spaniard, I have good eyesight, good hearing, a good sense of"
"smell, and... lots of sentiment.’"
"“I didn’t exactly understand what he meant me to think, and I didn’t pay"
any attention to him.
"“It seems that the Norwegian is going away soon, and as the day of his"
"departure approaches, he grows funereal.”"
_THE SADNESS OF LIFE_
"“I don’t know why I don’t go away,” Cæsar wrote to his friend another"
time. “When I go out in the evening and see the ochre-coloured houses on
"both sides and the blue sky above, a horrible sadness takes me. These"
"spring days oppress me, make me want to weep; it seems to me it would"
"be better to be dead, leaving no tomb or name or other ridiculous and"
"disagreeable thing, but disappearing into the air or the sea. It"
doesn’t seem natural; but I have never been so happy as one time when I
"was in Paris sick, alone and with a fever. I was in an hotel room and"
"my window looked into the garden of a fine house, where I could see the"
"tops of the trees; and I transformed them into a virgin forest, wherein"
marvellous adventures happened to me.
“Since then I have often thought that things are probably neither good
"nor bad, neither sad nor happy, in themselves; he who has sound, normal"
"nerves, and a brain equally sound, reflects the things around him like a"
"good mirror, and feels with comfort the impression of his conformity to"
"laid hold on fame while as yet deeming himself unfamous. It's curious,"
"but true, nevertheless, that very often the writers who thought least"
of themselves during their lifetime have become the most universally
"renowned after their deaths. Shakespeare, I dare say, had no very"
"exaggerated idea of the beauty of his own plays,--he seems to have"
"written just the best that was in him, without caring what anybody"
thought of it. And I believe that is the only way to succeed in the
"end."""
"""In the end!"" repeated Alwyn dreamily--""In the end, no worldly success"
"is worth attaining,--a few thousand years and the greatest are"
"forgotten!"""
"""Not the GREATEST,""--said Villiers warmly--""The greatest must always be"
"remembered."""
"""No, my friend!--Not even the greatest! Do you not think there must"
"have been great and wise and gifted men in Tyre, in Sidon, in Carthage,"
"in Babylon?--There are five men mentioned in Scripture, as being 'ready"
"to write swiftly'--Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Ariel--where is"
the no doubt admirable work done by these? Perhaps ... who knows? ...
"one of them was as great as Homer in genius,--we cannot tell!"""
"""True,--we cannot tell!"" responded Villiers meditatively--""But, Alwyn,"
if you persist in viewing things through such tremendous vistas of
"time, and in measuring the Future by the Past, then one may ask what is"
"the use of anything?"""
"""There IS no use in anything, except in the making of a strong,"
"persistent, steady effort after good,"" said Alwyn earnestly ... ""We men"
"are cast, as it were, between two swift currents, Wrong and"
"Right,--Self and God,--and it seems more easy to shut our eyes and"
"There was an Old Man of Cape Horn,"
Who wished he had never been born;
"So he sat in a chair till he died of despair,"
That dolorous Man of Cape Horn.
"Now, except in case of very young children, this could not possibly be"
taken seriously. The least observant normal boy or girl would recognise
the hollowness of the pessimism that prevents a man from at least an
attempt to rise from his chair.
The following I have chosen as repeated with intense appreciation and
much dramatic vigour by a little boy just five years old:
"There was an Old Man who said, “Hush!"
I perceive a young bird in this bush!”
"When they said, “Is it small?” he replied, “Not at all!"
It is four times as big as the bush!”[32]
One of the most desirable of all elements to introduce into our stories
is that which encourages kinship with animals. With very young children
"this is easy, because in those early years when the mind is not clogged"
"with knowledge, the sympathetic imagination enables them to enter into"
the feelings of animals. Andersen has an illustration of this point in
his “Ice Maiden”:
“Children who cannot talk yet can understand the language of fowls and
"ducks quite well, and cats and dogs speak to them quite as plainly as"
"Father and Mother; but that is only when the children are very small,"
and then even Grandpapa's stick will become a perfect horse to them
"that can neigh and, in their eyes, is furnished with legs and a tail."
"With some children this period ends later than with others, and of such"
"Let's see what our surroundings look like."""
"They walked to the nearest window-aperture, and gazed out on a"
startling and marvelous scene.
*       *       *       *       *
"Beneath their high tower window, extending as far as the eye could"
"reach, lay the city, lit by the reddish glare of the peculiar metal"
with which its streets were paved. For the most part the metropolis
consisted of perfectly square buildings pierced by many windows to
indicate that each housed a large number of inmates. But here and
"there grotesque turrets lanced the sky, and symbolic domes arched"
above the surrounding flat metal roofs.
One building in particular they noticed. This was an enormous
structure in the shape of a half-globe that reared its spherical
height less than an eighth of a mile from the building they were in.
"It was situated off to their right at the foot of a vast, high-walled"
enclosure whose near end seemed to be formed by the right wall of
their prison. They could only see it by leaning far out of the
window; and it would not have come to their attention at all had they
"not heard it first--or, rather, heard the sound of something within"
it: for from it came a curious whining hum that never varied in
"intensity, something like the hum of a gigantic dynamo, only greater"
and of a more penetrating pitch.
"""Sounds as though it might be some sort of central power station,"""
"said Brand. ""But what could it supply power for?"""
"""Give it up,"" said Dex. ""For their damned shock-tubes, perhaps, among"
"other things--"""
"down to earth! Breathless, bewildered, lifted to a height of transport"
"beyond all words, Alwyn gazed upon her in entranced, devout"
"silence,--the vast cathedral seemed to swing round and round in great"
"glittering circles, and nothing was real, nothing steadfast, but that"
"slight, sweet maiden in her soft gray robes, with the Ardath-blossoms"
"gleaming white against her breast! Angel she was,--angel she ever would"
"be,--and yet--what did she SEEM? Naught but:"
"""A child-like woman, wise and very fair,"
"Crowned with the garland of her golden hair!"""
"This, and no more,--and yet in this was all earth and all heaven"
"comprised!--He gazed and gazed, overwhelmed by the amazement of his own"
"bliss,--he could have gazed upon her so in speechless ravishment for"
"hours, when, with a gesture of infinite grace and appeal, she stretched"
out her hands toward him:
"""Speak to me, dearest one!"" she murmured wistfully--""Tell me,--am I"
"welcome?"""
"""O exquisite humility!--O beautiful maiden-timid hesitation! Was"
"she,--even she, God's Angel, so far removed from pride, as to be"
uncertain of her lover's reception of such a gift of love? Roused from
"his half-swooning sense of wonder, he caught those gentle hands, and"
"laid them tenderly against his breast,--tremblingly, and all devoutly,"
"he drew the lovely, yielding form into his arms, close to his"
"heart,--with dazzled sight he gazed down into that pure, perfect face,"
those clear and holy eyes shining like new-created stars beneath the
soft cloud of clustering fair hair!
"""Welcome!"" he echoed, in a tone that thrilled with passionate awe and"
"ecstasy;--""My Edris! My Saint! My Queen! Welcome, more welcome than the"
"of Death coming in heroic form, as when a man or woman dies for a great"
"cause, in which he has opportunity of admiring courage, devotion and"
"unselfishness; or of Death coming as a result of treachery, such as"
"we find in the death of Baldur, of Siegfried, and of others, so that"
children may learn to abhor such deeds; but also a fair proportion of
"stories dealing with death that comes naturally, when our work is done"
"and our strength gone, which has no more tragedy than the falling of"
a leaf from the tree. In this way we can give children the first idea
that the individual is so much less than the whole.
Quite small children often take Death very naturally. A boy of five
met two of his older companions at the school door. They said sadly
"and solemnly: “We have just seen a dead man!” “Well,” said the little"
"philosopher, “that's all right. We've _all_ got to die when our work's"
done.”
"In one of the Buddha stories which I reproduce at the end of this book,"
"the little Hare (who is, I think, a symbol of nervous Individualism)"
"constantly says: “Suppose the Earth were to fall in, what would become"
of me?”
"As an antidote to the ordinary attitude towards death, I commend an"
"episode from a German folk-lore story called “Unlucky John,” which is"
included in the list of stories recommended at the end of this book.
The following sums up in poetic form some of the material necessary for
the wants of a child:
THE CHILD.
"The little new soul has come to Earth,"
convinced than ever before that there were at least distinct periods of
_good_ fortune in every man's life.
"Before reaching Gravesend, we halted at a grassy spot near the river"
"bank, where we ate our dinner. When the horses had rested, we set off for"
"Rochester, in which place we expected to spend the night at the Maid's"
"Garter, a famous old inn kept by a friend of Pickerings."
I had noticed a twinkle in Pickering's eyes when he directed us to go to
"this tavern, but did not understand the cause of his merriment until I"
"learned that by a curious old custom, a maid seeking entrance for the"
first time must contribute one of her garters before being admitted. The
worst feature of the usage was that the garter must be taken off at the
"door, and then and there presented to the porter, who received it on the"
point of his official staff.
"After entering Rochester, we went to the Maid's Garter and at once drove"
"into the courtyard, as the custom is with travellers intending to remain"
all night.
"When we left the coach and started to climb the steps to the great door,"
we found the landlord and his retinue waiting to receive us. Frances was
"in the lead, and when we reached the broad, flat stone in front of the"
"door, the head porter stepped before her, bowed, and asked humbly:--"
"""Is my lady maid or madam?"""
"Frances looked up in surprise, and he repeated his question."
"""What is that to you, fellow?"" asked Frances."
"""It is this, my lady,"" returned the porter. ""If my lady be a maid, she"
She made him a formal bow and was leaving the room; but his voice
stopped her.
"“Your anxiety cannot be very great, or you would wait to learn whether"
your suspicions are baseless or not.”
"She paused, in a dignified attitude, with her hand on the back of a"
"chair, while he adjusted his gold pince-nez and ran through the list."
"“You are right so far,” he said coldly. “The names are identical.”"
They parted at the door. The Canon walked back to his hotel with anger
"in his heart. In spite of cumulative evidence, the theory that his"
cousin had insinuated was prima facie preposterous. It was important
"enough, however, to need some investigation. But the feeling uppermost"
in his mind was indignation with Mrs. Winstanley. He was too shrewd a
man not to have perceived long ago her jealousy of Yvonne; but beyond
"keeping a watchful eye lest his wife should receive hurt, he had not"
"condescended to take it into serious consideration. Now, beneath her"
impressive manner he clearly divined the desire to inflict on Yvonne
"a deadly injury. To have leaped at such a conclusion, to have sought"
"subsequent proof from the Visitors’ List, argued malicious design. He"
could never forgive her.
Still the matter had to be cleared up at once. On his arrival at the
"Océan, he went forthwith to Yvonne’s room, and entered on receiving an"
acknowledgment of his knock. She was standing in the light of the window
"by the toilet table, doing her hair. The rest of the room was in the"
shadow of the gathering evening.
"“Well,” she said, without turning, “are they coming?”"
"""At the same time you are held indemnified for all killings of"
such persons as may stand in your way in the execution of the
"duty laid upon you, and by order of the King himself you hereby"
"take rank as a full Colonel in his service."""
Meanwhile Cabrera had been bending his brows over the note which had
been directed to him personally. He rose and paced the length of the
"garden-wall with the letter in his hand, while Rollo stood his ground"
with an unmoved countenance. Presently he stopped opposite the young man
and stood regarding him intently.
"""I am, I understand, to furnish you with men for this venture,"" he said;"
"""good--but I am at liberty to prove you first. That you are cool and"
"brave I know. We must find out whether you are loyal as well."""
"""I am as loyal as any Spaniard who ever drew breath,"" retorted Rollo,"
"hotly, ""and in this matter I will answer for my companions as well."""
"""And pray in what way, Sir Spitfire?"" said Cabrera, smiling."
"""Why, as a man should,"" said Rollo, ""with his sword or his pistol,"
or--as is our island custom--with his fists--it is all the same to me;
"yes, even with your abominable Spanish knife, which is no true"
"gentleman's weapon!"""
"""I am no unfriend to plainness, sir, either in speech or action,"" said"
"Cabrera; ""I see you are indeed a brave fellow, and will not lessen the"
king's chances of coming to his own by letting you loose on the men
under my command. Still for one day you will not object to ride with
"us!"""
"aware--the garlic--the onions--we of this country love them?"""
"""But so do I,"" cried Rollo, ""and I will not have distinctions made on"
this expedition. We are all to risk our lives equally and we shall all
"fare equally, and if we are caught our dose of lead or halter-hemp will"
"be just the same."""
Here El Sarria interrupted.
"""With respect,"" he said, ""it is true that this gentleman hath some"
private matters to communicate to me which have nothing to do with the
object of our mission. I crave your permission that for to-day I may
"dine apart with him!"""
After this there was no more to be said. El Sarria helped the sergeant
"to serve the meal, which was at once the proof of his foraging ability"
"and his consummate genius as a cook. For though the day was Friday, the"
soup was very far from _maigre_. The stew contained both lamb and fresh
pork cut into generous cubes with a sufficiency of savoury fat included.
A sausage had been sliced small for seasoning and the whole had been so
"smothered in _garbanzos_, haricot beans, rice, mixed with strips of"
"toothsome salt fish, that John Mortimer bent and said a well-deserved"
blessing over the viands.
"""I don't usually in this country,"" he explained, ""but really this is"
what my good old father would call a manifest providence. That fellow of
"ours will prove a treasure."""
"""It seems so,"" said Rollo, a little grimly, ""that is, if he can scout"
"and fight as well as he can cater and cook."""
"For himself the young Scot cared little what he ate, and would have"
before the men left behind saw him again.

TRAPPING AN ABORIGINE
In houses and clothing the Darien Indians are decidedly primitive]

Death came fast to those in the jungle. The agonies they suffered from
"starvation, exposure and insect pests baffle description. “Truxton in"
"casting his eyes on the ground saw a toad”, wrote the historian."
"“Instantly snatching it up, he bit off the head and, spitting it away,"
"devoured the body. Maury looked at him a moment, and then picked up the"
"rejected head, saying, ‘Well, Truxton, you are getting quite particular."
"Something of an epicure, eh’? With these words he quietly devoured the"
head himself.”
Nine of the twenty-seven men who entered the Darien with Strain died.
"When the leader returned with the relief party they were found, like"
"Greely at Camp Starvation, unable to move and slowly dying. Those who"
retained life never fully regained strength. Every condition which
brought such frightful disaster upon the Strain party exists in the
"Darien today. The Indians are as hostile, the trails as faintly"
"outlined, the jungle as dense, the insects as savage. Only along the"
"banks of the rivers has civilization made some little headway, but the"
richest gold field twenty miles back in the interior is as safe from
civilized workings as though it were walled in with steel and guarded by
dragons. Every speculative man you meet in Panama will assure you that
the gold is there but all agree that conditions must be radically
changed before it can be gotten out unless a regiment and a subsistence
"They were bound hand and foot. At a piping cry from the leader,"
several of the gangling figures picked them up in reedy arms and began
"to walk across the square, away from the ship. Brand noticed that his"
bearers' arms trembled with his weight: and sensed the flabbiness of
the substance that took the place in them of good solid muscle.
Physically these things were soft and ineffectual indeed. They had
only the ominous tubes with which to fight.
"The eery procession, with the bound Earthmen carried in the lead,"
wound toward a great building fringing the square. In through the high
"arched entrance of this building they went, and up a sloping incline"
"to its tower-top. Here, in a huge bare room, the two were"
unceremoniously dumped to the floor.
"While three of the things stood guard with the mysterious tubes,"
"another unbound them. A whole shower of high pitched, piping syllables"
"was hurled at them, speech which sounded threatening and contemptuous"
"but was otherwise, of course, entirely unintelligible, and then the"
"creatures withdrew. The heavy metal door was slammed shut, and they"
were alone.
"Brand drew a long breath, and began to feel himself all over for"
broken bones. He found none; he was still nerve-wracked from that last
"terrific shock, but otherwise whole and well."
"""Are you hurt, Dex?"" he asked solicitously."
"""I guess not,"" replied Dex, getting uncertainly to his feet. ""And I'm"
wondering why. It seems to me the brutes were uncommonly considerate
"of us--and I'm betting the reason is one we won't like!"""
"Brand shrugged. ""I guess we'll find out their intentions soon enough."
"for their boots were soaked through and their heavy buffalo overcoats,"
"caps and ear-muffs were covered with snow, which all, save Rance,"
proceeded to remove by shaking their shoulders and stamping their feet.
"The latter, however, calmly took off his gloves, pulled out a"
"beautifully-creased handkerchief from his pocket, and began slowly to"
flick off the snow from his elegant mink overcoat before hanging it
carefully upon a peg on the wall. After that he went over to the table
"and warmed his hands over the lighted candle there. Meanwhile, Sonora,"
"his nose, as well as his hands which with difficulty he removed from his"
"heavy fur mittens, showing red and swollen from the effects of the"
"biting cold, had gone over to the fire, where he ejaculated:"
"""Ouf, I'm cold! Glad you're safe, Girl!"""
"""Yes, Girl, The Polka's had a narrow squeak,"" observed Nick, stamping"
"his feet which, as well as his legs, were wrapped with pieces of"
blankets for added warmth.
"Unconsciously, at his words, the Girl's eyes travelled to the bed; then,"
"drawing her robe snugly about her, and seating herself, she asked with"
suppressed excitement:
"""Why, Nick, what's the matter? What's--"""
Rance took it upon himself to do the answering. Sauntering over to the
"Girl, he drawled out:"
"""It takes you a long time to get up, seems to me. You haven't so much"
"on, either,"" he went on, piercing her with his eyes."
"Smilingly and not in the least disconcerted by the Sheriff's remark, the"
Girl picked up a rug from the floor and wound it about her knees.

condition. They constitute a very common type of dream not quite easy to
"explain. Dr. Savage mentions, for instance, that in his own case scarcely"
"a week passes without such a dream, though in real life he scarcely ever"
loses a train and never worries about it. Wundt considers that the dreams
in which we seek something we cannot find or have left something behind
are due to indefinite coenaesthesic disturbances involving feelings of
"the same emotional tone, such as an uncomfortable position or a slight"
irregularity of respiration. I have myself independently observed the same
"connection, though it is not invariably traceable.]"

"of the stapedius muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might"

caught the sound of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an

frontier. These posts were already in difficulties owing to the
Raiders' interference with their commissariat.
"As can be imagined there was a great deal of noise, the native"
drivers gesticulating and talking in a way which proved that
something was afoot. I got out of the car and asked who was in charge
"of the caravan. A huge native contractor was pointed out to me, and,"
summoning him to my side I asked him what all the hubbub was about.
He was in a state of great agitation and told me that he had received
information from several reliable sources that the whole of the
"countryside ahead of them was in the hands of the Raiders, and that,"
"therefore, it was useless to go a step further."
"I expostulated with the man, pointing out that, by the terms of his"
"contract, he must go on, and that if he did not the soldiers for whom"
he was bringing supplies would die of starvation.
But he was dogged. He knew too well the methods of the Raiders with
the men they captured.
"""It's no use, Sahib,"" he said, respectfully but firmly. ""My men will"
"not go on as they are unarmed, and a single armed Raider is enough to"
"hold up the whole caravan."""
"I knew the man was right, but persisted in my efforts to persuade him"
"to chance it, pointing out that he might be lucky enough to elude the"
Raiders and to win through.
"""If the Government will give me a military escort I will go, but not"
"without,"" was his final word."

the bowel in the neighbourhood was thickened. All three
openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There
was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little
escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the
"bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and"
lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily
"closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,"
and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled
water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the
mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis
"materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a"
"half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours"
later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was
present which had already closed at the time of operation.

4 Hamilton    . . . . . . shales and sandstones

2 Oriskany    . . . . . . sandstones

The Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists
to the Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch
when waves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The
limestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea
which extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals
"throve luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and"
"other lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone."
"The bordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now"
have been monotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the
finest waste to the sea.
In the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became
clouded with mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and
"sandy shales of the Chemung, which are found off what was at the"
"time the west coast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient"
continent.
The Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to
"northeastern Ohio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an"
area of not less than a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern
New York it attains three thousand feet in thickness; in
Pennsylvania it reaches the enormous thickness of two miles; but
it rapidly thins to the west. Everywhere the Chemung is made of
"thin beds of rapidly alternating coarse and fine sands and clays,"
"with an occasional pebble layer, and hence is a shallow-water"
deposit. The fine material has not been thoroughly winnowed from
"are characterized, the one by the dominance of fishes, and the"
other by the appearance of amphibians and reptiles.
"Each of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may"
be recognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The
names first given them in Great Britain have therefore come into
"general use, while their subdivisions, which often cannot be"
"correlated in different countries and different regions, are"
usually given local names.
The first three systems were named from the fact that their strata
are well displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name
"of Wales, and the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of"
ancient Britons which inhabited the same country. The Devonian is
"named from the English county Devon, where its rocks were early"
studied. The Carboniferous was so called from the large amount of
coal which it was found to contain in Great Britain and
continental Europe.
THE CAMBRIAN
DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts
about the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake
"Superior region, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips"
of Cambrian formations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of
New England and the maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt
borders on the west the crystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and
on the opposite side of the continent the Cambrian reappears in
the mountains of the Great Basin and the Canadian Rockies. In the
Mississippi valley it is exposed in small districts where uplift
has permitted the stripping off of younger rocks. Although the
"areas of outcrop are small, we may infer that Cambrian rocks were"
"command console, which was preset for each flight and then monitored"
from the cockpit.
Now where's the damned on-board AI module?
He scanned the bay. The AI system was the key to his plan. He had to
make certain the computer's artificial intelligence functions could be
"completely shut down, disengaged, when the crucial moment came. He"
couldn't afford for the on-board system-override to abort his planned
revision in the hypersonic flight plan. His job tonight was to make
"sure all the surprises were his, not somebody else's. There wouldn't be"
any margin for screw-ups. Everything had to go like clockwork.
"He edged his way on through the freezing bay, searching the banks of"
"equipment for a clue, and then he saw what he was looking for. There,"
"along the portside bulkhead. It was a white, rectangular console, and"
everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted.
"He studied it a second, trying to decide where to begin."
At that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly how he'd
ever gotten into this crazy situation. Maybe he should have quit the
Air Force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had
"wanted. Right now, he had to admit, a little electrical engineering"
would definitely come in handy.
He took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing the AI
"console's faceplate, a bronzed rectangle. Eight screws later, he lifted"
it off and settled it on the floor.
The penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat sections of
plastic-coated wires. Somewhere in this electronic ganglia there had to
"first flowers seen after winter snows!--welcome, more welcome than"
"swift rescue to one in dire peril!--welcome, my Angel, into the"
"darkness of mortal things, which haply so sweet a Presence shall make"
bright! O sacred innocence that I am not worthy to shield! ... O
sinless beauty that I am all unfitted to claim or possess! Welcome to
"my life, my heart, my soul! Welcome, sweet Trust, sweet Hope, sweet"
"Love, that as Christ lives, I will never wrong, betray, or resign again"
"through all the glory spaces of far Eternity!"""
"As he spoke, his arms closed more surely about her,--his lips met"
"hers,--and in the mingled human and divine rapture of that moment,"
"there came a rushing noise, as of thousands of wings beating the air,"
followed by a mighty wave of music that rolled approachingly and then
"departingly through and through the Cathedral arches--and a Voice,"
"clear and resonant as a silver clarion, proclaimed aloud:"
"""Those whom GOD hath joined together, let no MAN put asunder!"""
"Then, with a surging, jubilant sound, like the sea in a storm, the"
"music seemed to tread past in a measured march of stately harmony,--and"
"presently there was silence once more,--the silence and sunshine of the"
morning pouring through the rose windows of the church and sparkling on
"the Cross above the Altar,--the silence of a love made perfect,--of"
twin souls made ONE!
And then Edris drew herself gently from her lover's embrace and raised
"her head,--putting her hand confidingly in his, a lovely smile played"
on her sweetly parted lips:
"""Take me, Theos,"" she said softly, ""Lead me,--into the World!"""

former showing his delight in a rare display of white teeth and a flow
"of unintelligible English. Even the sledge-dogs, now fat from idleness,"
"greeted their mistress with a fierce clamor that dismayed Alton Clyde,"
to whom all was utterly new and strange.
"""Glory be!"" he exclaimed. ""They're nothing but wolves. Won't they bite?"
"And the house--ain't it a hit! Why, it looks like a stage setting! Oh,"
"say, I'm for this! I'm getting rough and primitive and brutal already!"""
"When they passed from the store, with its shelves sadly naked now, to"
"the cozy living quarters behind, his enthusiasm knew no bounds. Leaving"
"Chakawana and her mistress to chatter and clack in their patois, he"
"inspected the premises inside and out, peering into all sorts of"
"corners, collecting souvenirs, and making friends with the saturnine"
breed.
"Cherry would not return to the ship, but Emerson and Clyde re-embarked"
"and were rowed down to the cannery site, abreast of which lay _The"
"Bedford Castle_, where they lingered until the creeping twilight forced"
them to the boat again. When they reached the ship the cool Arctic
"night had descended, but its quiet was broken by the halting nimble of"
"steam-winches, the creak of tackle, the cries of men, and the sounds of"
a great activity. Baring his head to the breezes Boyd filled his lungs
"full of the bracing air, sweet with the flavor of spring, vowing"
secretly that no music that he had ever heard was the equal of this. He
"turned his face to the southward and smiled, while his thoughts sped a"
message of love and hope into the darkness.
LONG DELAYED SUCCESS
"And when the night was at its darkest, light gradually appeared, and"
after innumerable difficulties had been overcome his Resonant Recorder
"was perfected, which enabled the plant to tell its own story. And in"
the meantime something still more wonderful came to pass. Hitherto all
gates had been barred and he had to produce his passports everywhere. He
now found friends who never asked him for credentials. His time had come
at last. The Royal Society found his new methods most convincing and
honoured him by publication of his researches in the Philosophical
"transactions. And his discoveries, which had so long remained in"
"obscurity, found enthusiastic acceptance."
Though his theories had thus received acceptance from the leading
"scientific men of the Royal Society, there was yet no general conviction"
of the identity of life reactions in plant and animal. No amount of
controversy can remove the tendency of the human mind to follow
precedents. The only thing left was to make the plant itself bear
"witness before the scientific bodies in the West, by means of"
"self-records. At the recommendation of the Minister of Education, and of"
"the Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State sanctioned his"
scientific deputation to Europe and America.
JOURNEY OF INDIAN PLANT ROUND THE WORLD
The special difficulty which he had to contend against lay in the fact
"that the only time during which the plant flourished at all in the West,"
"was in the months of July and August, when the Universities and"
scientific societies were in vacation. The only thing left was to take
the bold step of carrying growing plants from India and trust to human
"without undue hostility to strangers, they discourage their incursions."

A GIRL OF THE CHOCO TRIBE]
“Their means of persuasion are adjusted to the importance of the
intruder. They do not hesitate to shoot at any negro of the nearby
settlements poaching on their cocoanuts or other products; the trader or
any occasional visitor is very seldom allowed to stay ashore at night;
the adventurers who try to go prospecting into Indian territory are
invariably caught and shipped back to the next Panamanian port”.
Among the men of the San Blas tribe the land held by their people is
"regarded as a sacred trust, bequeathed to them by their ancestors and to"
be handed down by them to the remotest posterity. During the early days
of the Canal project it was desired to dig sand from a beach in the San
Blas country. A small United States man-of-war was sent thither to
"broach the subject to the Indians, and the Captain held parley with the"
chief. After hearing the plea and all the arguments and promises with
which it was strengthened the old Indian courteously refused the
privilege:
"“He who made this land”, said he, “made it for Cuna-Cuna who live no"
"longer, for those who are here today and also for the ones to come. So"
it is not ours only and we could not sell it”.
"To this decision the tribe adhered, and the wishes of the aborigines"
have been respected. It has been the policy of the United States to
avoid any possibility of giving offense to the native population of the
fail to appreciate the courtesy and consideration which he consistently
"showed her now. His patience with Captain Dove, a trying companion at"
"the best of times and doubly troublesome idle, more than once made her"
wonder whether he could be the same Jasper Slyne she had known on the
_Olive Branch_. Prosperity seemed to have improved him almost beyond
recognition.
He had a cabin at her disposal on the Calais-Dover steamer but she
"stayed on deck throughout the brief passage, glad to breathe the salt"
"sea-air again, while he entertained her with descriptions of London and"
she watched the twinkling lights that were guiding her home.
"And then came London itself, at last, somewhat grey, and cold, and"
disconsolate-looking on a wet winter morning.
"But after breakfast in a cosy suite at the Savoy, a blink of sunshine"
along the Embankment helped to better that first hasty impression. And
then Slyne took Captain Dove and her in a taxicab along the thronged and
bustling Strand to Mr. Jobling's office in Chancery Lane.
They got out in front of a dingy building not very far from Cursitor
"Street. It was raining again, and Sallie, looking up and down the"
"narrow, turbid thoroughfare, felt glad that she did not need to live"
there.
"Indoors, the atmosphere was scarcely less depressing. A dismal passage"
"led toward a dark stairway, up which they had to climb flight after"
"flight to reach at last a dusty, ill-smelling, gas-lighted room,"
"inhabited only by a shabby, shock-headed hobbledehoy of uncertain age"
"and unprepossessing appearance, perched on a preposterously high stool"
"at a still higher desk, behind a cage-like partition."
"By a window at the end of the passage, one could see, far away, the"
"Alban Hills, looking like a blue mountain-range, half hidden in white"
"haze, and nearby one could see the trees in the Protestant cemetery and"
the pyramid of Caïus Cestius close to them.
"Cæsar felt a sort of deep repugnance for the people shut up here,"
remote from life and protected from it by a lot of things.
“The man who is playing the harmonium in this church with its opaque
"light, is a coward,” he said to himself. “One must live and struggle in"
"the open air, among men, in the midst of their passions and hatreds,"
even though one’s miserable nerves quiver and tremble.”
"After showing them the monastery, the abbot Hildebrand took them to his"
"study, where he worked at revising ancient translations of the Bible. He"
had photographic copies of all the Latin texts and he was collating them
with the original.
"They talked of the progress of the Church, and the abbot commented with"
"some contempt on the worldly success of the Jesuit churches, with their"
saints who serve as well to get husbands and rich wives as to bring
winning numbers in the lottery.
"Before going out, they went to a window, at the other end of the"
corridor from where they had looked out before. Below them they could
"see the Tiber as far as the Ripa harbour; opposite, the heights of the"
"Janiculum, and further, Saint Peter’s."
"When they went out, Kennedy said to Cæsar:"
"“What devilish effect has the abbey produced in you, that you are so"
much gayer than when we went in?”
They were now in the midst of the great wilderness. On all sides
"myriads of trees, interminably pillared; through their tops the wind"
sighed and pined like the soft breath of a sleeping world. Away on
"every hand stretched oblivious vistas, black under multitudinous green"
spires.
"The interminable trees seemed to vex the duke's spirit, as their"
trunks crowded the winding track and seemed to shut in the twain as
"with a never ending barrier. And behind them, with the muffled tread"
"of a phantom army, came the duke's armed array striding through the"
night.
"""Have you too suffered a wrong at the hands of the Frangipani?"""
"Francesco at last broke the silence, turning to his companion."
The latter jerked the bridle of his charger so viciously that the
terrified animal reared on its haunches and neighed in protest.
"""Man, know you whereof you speak?"" the duke snarled, as he came closer"
"to Francesco. ""He has made the one woman the Duke of Spoleto ever"
"loved--a wanton!""--"
They pushed uphill through the solemn shadows of the forest. A sound
like the raging of a wind through a wood came down to them faintly
"from afar. It was a sullen sound, deep and mysterious as the hoarse"
"babel of the sea, smitten through with the shrill scream of trumpets,"
like the cry of gulls above a storm. Yet in the aisles of the pine
forest it was still as death.
"Then, like a spark struck from flint and steel falling upon tinder, a"
red glare blazed out against the background of the night. A horn
"blared across the moorlands; the castle bell began to ring, jerkily,"
Propped against the circular walls were the first lieutenant and two
seamen. All the occupants of the conning-tower had been overcome by
the noxious fumes from the highly-charged projectile.
Gasping for fresh air Terence flung himself upon the steam-steering
gear and put the helm hard over. A glimpse through one of the slits
revealed the fact that the cruiser was answering to her helm. Yet so
"narrowly had a collision been averted that the ""Sunderland's"""
"starboard side was within twenty feet of the ""Bradford's"" port"
quarter as the two vessels swung apart.
"The guns were now silent, for with the destruction of the foremast"
the fire-control platform and its occupants had been swept out of
existence. The cruiser was temporarily out of action.
"Terence was beginning to feel dizzy and faint. Why, he knew not."
Perhaps it was the pungent fumes. Leaning over the mouthpiece of the
speaking tube he ordered a couple of quartermasters to be sent to the
conning-tower. He could hardly recognize the sound of his own voice.
It seemed miles away.
Again he looked ahead. The cruiser was still drawing further and
further out of range. Having satisfied himself on that score and that
there was no fresh danger of colliding with any of the rest of the
"fleet, he staggered into the open air and leaned heavily against the"
"outer wall of the conning-tower, He was barely conscious that the"
metal was still hot.
"Up came the quartermasters. At their heels was a sub-lieutenant, his"
face grimed with smoke and his uniform torn.
"""Take over, Garboard,"" ordered the lieutenant brokenly. ""Report to"
Thus far what we call civilization has dealt less harshly with the
Indians of the Isthmus than with our own. They have at least survived it
and kept a great part of their territory for their own. The “squaw-man”
who figures so largely in our own southwestern Indian country is unknown
there. Unquestionably during the feverish days of the Spaniards’ hunt
"for gold the tribes were frightfully thinned out, and even today"
sections of the country which writers of Balboa’s time describe as
thickly populated are desert and untenanted. Yet much land is still held
"by its aboriginal owners, and unless the operation of the Canal shall"
turn American settlement that way will continue so to be held. The
Panamanian has not the energy to dislodge the Indians nor to till their
lands if he should possess them.
"Many studies of the Panama Indians as a body, or of isolated tribes,"
"have been made by explorers or scientists, and mainly by French or"
Spanish students. The Smithsonian Institution catalogues forty-seven
publications dealing with the subject. But there is an immense mine of
anthropological information yet to be worked in the Isthmus. It is not
"to be acquired readily or without heavy expenditure of energy, patience"
and money. A thoroughly scientific exploring expedition to unravel the
"riddle of the Darien, to count and describe the Indian tribes of the"
"Isthmus, and to record and authenticate traditions dating back to the"
"Spanish days, would be well worth the while of a geographical society, a"
university or some patron of exploring enterprises.

SOCIAL LIFE ON THE CANAL ZONE
persons at all hazards.
Verily the whole situation was remarkably complex.
The briefest look around convinced Rollo that it would be impossible for
so small a party to hold the long range of iron palisades which
"surrounded the palace. These were complete, indeed, but their extent was"
far too great to afford any hope of keeping out the gipsies without
"finding themselves taken in the rear. They must hold La Granja itself,"
"that was clear. There remained, therefore, only the problem of finding"
entrance.
Between the porter's lodge and the great gates near the _Colegiata_ they
discovered a ladder left somewhat carelessly against a wall where
"whitewashing had been going on during the day, some ardent royal"
"tradesman having ventured back, preferring the chance of the plague to"
the abandonment of his contract.
"This they at once appropriated, and Rollo and the Sergeant, being the"
"two most agile of the company, prepared to mount."
"If the time had been less critical, and a disinterested observer had"
"been available, it would at this moment have been interesting to observe"
the demeanour of Concha. Feeling that in a manner she was present on
"sufferance, she could not of course make any objection to the plan of"
"escalade, nor could she offer to accompany Rollo and the Sergeant, but"
"with clasped hands and tightly compressed lips she stood beneath,"
repeating under her breath quick-succeeding prayers for the safety of
one (or both) of the adventurers.
So patent and eager was her anxiety even in the gloom of the night that
"La Giralda, to whom her agitation was manifest, laid her hand on the"
individual caprice be allowed to find expression as well as yours?
Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite
"other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,"
"and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no"
necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a
flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am
always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country.
"Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to"
"find for ourselves, as best we may, the _décor_ which is the town"
equivalent of the great natural _décor_ of fields and hills. Here it is
that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the
"effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet"
"most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own"
way.
"That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and"
the other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I
"listen in amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an"
"estimable personal prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and"
"uttered in the name of art. For in art there can be no prejudices, only"
"results. If we arc to save people’s souls by the writing of verses,"
"well and good. But if not, there is no choice but to admit an absolute"
"freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why not Patchouli?"

"London, _February,_1896."
advantage of the fact that the attention of the British seaplanes and
"destroyers was centred on the fugitive Taubes, these giant airships,"
"by reason of their altitude, were able to manoeuvre immediately above"
the flotilla.
"It was an opportunity too good to be missed, for although the"
objective of the Zeppelins was a raid on London--they having decided
upon a circuitous course over Kent and Sussex borders in order to
avoid the air-stations at the Isle of Grain--the chance of raining a
shower of bombs upon the British cruiser and her attendant destroyers
was too tempting.
"For once, at least, the German Admiralty had not been kept well"
"posted as to the details of armament of the cruisers of the ""Town"
"Class,"" for the ""Sunderland"" and her consorts had recently been"
equipped with a couple of 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns. These
weapons fired a shell of unique character. Somewhat resembling a
"shrapnel, the missile was packed with short lengths of chain and"
charged with a high explosive.
Almost as soon as the Zeppelins were discovered both guns barked
venomously. From the point of view of the observers on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge the shells appeared to burst close to the frail"
"targets. Both airships were observed to pitch violently, while one,"
"with her nose tilted downwards, began to descend."
"""She's done for!"" exclaimed Terence."
A round of cheering burst from the throats of the crew. It seemed as
if nothing could arrest the seaward plunge of one of the Kaiser's
gas-bags. Not only had her bow compartments been holed but the
nacelle containing the propelling machinery was completely wrecked.
now churned to milky foam by the ever-growing throng of prisoners; and
"all the time the big plants gulped the sea harvest, faster and faster,"
"clanking and gnashing their metal jaws, while the mounds of salmon lay"
hip-deep to the crews that fed the butchering machines.
The time had come for man to take his toll.
Now dawned a period of feverish activity wherein no one might rest
"short of actual exhaustion. Haste became the cry, and comfort fled."
"At Emerson's cannery there fell a sudden panic, for fifty fishermen"
"quit. Returning from the banks on the night before the run started,"
they stacked their gear and notified Boyd Emerson of their
"determination. Then, despite his utmost efforts to dissuade them, they"
took their packs upon their shoulders and marched up the beach to
"Willis Marsh's plant. Larsen, the day-foreman, acted as their"
So the real size and bounds of the Republic must be set down as somewhat
indeterminate.
The circumstances under which Panama became an independent nation have
been set forth in an earlier chapter. It is safe to say that with the
"heavy investment made by the United States in the Canal Zone, on the"
"strength of a treaty with the infant republic, the sovereignty of Panama"
will be forever maintained against all comers--except the United States

state may yet be the southern boundary of the Great Republic of the
North. For the present however Uncle Sam is quite content with the Canal
Zone and a certain amount of diplomatic influence over the government of
Panama.

Part VI.--OFFENCES.
"without me. With bad luck and bad weather, I might have had to wait"
"a few weeks, if not months in Nabwageta. I could perhaps have sailed"
"in a native canoe, but this could only be done without bedding, tent,"
"or even writing outfit and photographic apparatus, and so my travelling"
would have been quite useless. It was a piece of great good luck that
"a day or two afterwards, a motor launch, whose owner had heard about"
"my staying in the Amphletts, anchored in front of Nabwageta village,"
"and within an hour I was speeding towards the Trobriands again,"
following the tracks of the Kula fleet.
II
"On the next morning, as we slowly made our way along the channels"
"in the opalescent, green lagoon, and as I watched a fleet of small,"
"local canoes fishing in their muddy waters, and could recognise on"
"the surrounding flat shores a dozen well-known villages, my spirits"
"rose, and I felt well pleased to have left the picturesque, but"
"ethnographically barren Amphletts for the Trobriands, with their"
scores of excellent informants.
"Moreover, the Amphletts, in the persons of their male inhabitants"
"were soon to join me here. I went ashore in Sinaketa, where everybody"
was full of the great moment which was soon to arrive. For the Dobuan
"fleet was known to be coming, though on that morning, so far, no news"
"had reached them of its whereabouts. As a matter of fact, the Dobuans,"
"who had left Nabwageta forty-eight hours ahead of me, had made a slow"
"journey with light winds, and sailing a course to the East of mine,"
had arrived that morning only in Vakuta.
"Again, in Eugene Field's “Hushaby Lady,” the language of which is most"
"simple, the child is carried away by the beauty of the sound."
I remember hearing some poetry repeated by the children in one of
the elementary schools in Sheffield which made me feel that they had
realised romantic possibilities which would prevent their lives from
"ever becoming quite prosaic again, and I wish that this practice"
were more usual. There is little difficulty with the children. I can
"remember, in my own experience as a teacher in London, making the"
experiment of reading or repeating passages from Milton and Shakespeare
"to children from nine to eleven years of age, and the enthusiastic"
"way they responded by learning those passages by heart. I have taken,"
"with several sets of children, such passages from Milton as “Echo"
"Song,” “Sabrina,” “By the rushy fringed Bank,” “Back, shepherds, back,”"
"from _Comus_, “May Morning,” “Ode to Shakespeare,” “Samson on his"
"blindness,” etc. I even ventured on several passages from _Paradise"
"Lost_, and found “Now came still evening on” a particular favourite"
with the children.
"It seemed even easier to interest them in Shakespeare, and they learned"
"quite readily and easily many passages from “As You Like It,” “Merchant"
"of Venice,” “Julius Cæsar”; from “Richard II,” “Henry IV,” and “Henry"
V.”
The method I should recommend in the introduction of both poets
occasionally into the Story-hour would be threefold.
"First, to choose passages which appeal for beauty of sound or beauty"
"of mental vision called up by those sounds: such as, “Tell me where is"
"Fancy bred,” Titania's Lullaby, “How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon"
this bank.”
await this hour; there might one find the treasures of the Forty
"Thieves. And so I quarried on slowly, with bated breath, savouring"
"the interest. Believe me, I had little palate left for the jelly; and"
"though I preferred the taste when I took cream with it, I used often to"
go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures.”
"In his work on Imagination, Ribot says: “The free initiative of"
children is always superior to the imitations we pretend to make for
them.”
The passage from Robert Stevenson becomes more clear from a scientific
point of view when taken in connection with one from Karl Groos' book
on the “Psychology of Animal Play”:
"“The Child is wholly absorbed in his play, and yet under the ebb and"
"flow of thought and feeling like still water under wind-swept waves, he"
has the knowledge that it is pretence after all. Behind the sham ‘I’
"that takes part in the game, stands the unchanged ‘I’ which regards the"
sham ‘I’ with quiet superiority.”
Queyrat speaks of play as one of the distinct phases of a child's
"imagination; it is “essentially a metamorphosis of reality, a"
transformation of places and things.”
"Now to return to the point which Mrs. Ewing makes, namely, that we"
should develop in normal children the power of distinguishing between
Truth and Falsehood.
I should suggest including two or three stories which would test that
"power in children, and if they fail to realise the difference between"
romancing and telling lies then it is evident that they need special
attention and help along this line. I give the titles of two stories of
"Mr. Justin Carthew, on the other hand, is related to the family in a"
"very different and distant degree, and there are, as y'r ludship has"
"been good enough to agree, no other survivors."
"""I beg leave now to request that y'r ludship will rescind the authority"
"granted to Mr. Justin Carthew, and admit my client's petition _ad"
"referendum_."""
"""Produce your proofs,"" ordered his lordship, and Mr. Spettigrew"
extracted from a capacious black bag a pile of papers at which Mr.
Justice Gaunt looked with no little disgust.
"""What are they, in chief?"" asked Mr. Justice Gaunt, turning over page"
"after page of closely written law-script, as gingerly as if he believed"
that one might perhaps explode and blow him to pieces. And Mr.
"Spettigrew launched forth again into a long list of certificates,"
"records, researches, findings, orders of court, sworn statements and"
"affidavits, by Captain Dove--""Then trading in his own ship, m'lud, now"
"retired and devoting his time to mission-work among deep-sea sailors;"""
"by Mr. Jasper Slyne, gentleman; by Mr. Jobling, whom he did not pause"
"to describe; by a couple of dozen other people, living or dead, at home"
or abroad; all in due legal form and not to be controverted.
"""I think you'll find them in perfect order, and absolutely conclusive,"
"m'lud,"" counsel came to a finish triumphantly, and sat down, greatly to"
the relief of all present.
"""H'm!"" said his lordship, still gravely regarding Sallie: whose eyes had"
"nothing to conceal from him. ""And so this is the long-lost Lady"
"Josceline!"""
"His searching glance travelled slowly to Captain Dove's face, and then"
"fall into the Gulf of Perdition, unless God interposes.”"
"Now, apart from the folly of this story, we must condemn it on moral"
grounds. Could we imagine a lower standard of a Deity than that
presented here to the child?
To-day the teacher would commend Jane for a laudable interest in
"botany, but might add a word of caution about choosing inclined planes"
"as a hunting-ground for specimens and a popular, lucid explanation of"
the inexorable law of gravity.
Here we have an instance of applying a moral when we have finished our
"story, but there are many stories where nothing is left to chance in"
"this matter, and where there is no means for the child to use ingenuity"
or imagination in making out the meaning for himself.
Henry Morley has condemned the use of this method as applied to Fairy
Stories. He says: “Moralising in a Fairy Story is like the snoring of
Bottom in Titania's lap.”
"But I think this applies to all stories, and most especially to those"
by which we do wish to teach something.
"John Burroughs says in his article,[22] “Thou shalt not preach”:"
“Didactic fiction can never rank high. Thou shalt not preach or teach;
"though shalt pourtray and create, and have ends as universal as"
nature.... What Art demands is that the Artist's personal convictions
"and notions, his likes and dislikes, do not obtrude themselves at all;"
"that good and evil stand judged in his work by the logic of events,"
"as they do in nature, and not by any special pleading on his part. He"
does not hold a brief for either side; he exemplifies the working of
on his bent neck and promptly slithered inside his collar and down
his back.
Unfortunately the commander was a man of a most ticklish temperament.
The contact of the metal disc with his back caused him to writhe like
a lost soul in torment. He had recently unflinchingly faced death in
"a hotly-contested engagement in the North Sea, but this rear attack"
completely unnerved him. His grotesque efforts to capture the elusive
coin was too much for the rest of the officers and men. They were
unable to conceal their amusement. Finally the commander dived down
below and divested himself of his uniform.
"Just then the ship's steward appeared with the tin of condensed milk,"
and handed the unopened can to a seaman. Away aloft the man made his
"way till he gained the cross-trees. Owing to the ""Sunderland"""
"altering her course she was swinging considerably to starboard, and"
"the motion made the man advance cautiously, his feet sliding along"
the foot-ropes while he held on grimly with his free hand to the
spar.
Mephisto eyed the approaching delicacy with marked approval. Letting
"the remaining coins drop, some of which tinkled on deck although most"
"of them fell overboard, he whisked along the yard-arm, and before the"
"seaman realized the brute's intention, snatched the can from his"
grasp.
A snarl warned the bluejacket that if he advanced it would be at his
"peril, and unwilling to risk an encounter with an agile monkey on the"
"swaying yard, he followed the precept of discretion being the better"
"part of valour, and regained the deck, leaving the spoils in the"
hands of the elated ape.
true. It is for man not to quarrel with circumstances but bravely accept
them; and we belong to that race and dynasty who had accomplished great
things with simple means.
FAILURE AND SUCCESS
"This day twenty-three years ago, I resolved that as far as the"
"whole-hearted devotion and faith of one man counted, that would not be"
wanting and within six months it came about that some of the most
difficult problems connected with Electric Waves found their solution in
"my Laboratory and received high appreciation from Lord Kelvin, Lord"
Rayleigh and other leading physicists. The Royal Society honoured me by
"publishing my discoveries and offering, of their own accord, an"
appropriation from the special Parliamentary Grant for the advancement
of knowledge. That day the closed gates suddenly opened and I hoped that
"the torch that was then lighted would continue to burn brighter, and"
brighter. But man's faith and hope require repeated testing. For five
"years after this, the progress was interrupted; yet when the most"
generous and wide appreciation of my work had reached almost the highest
point there came a sudden and unexpected change.
LIVING AND NON-LIVING
In the pursuit of my investigations I was unconsciously led into the
border region of physics and physiology and was amazed to find boundary
lines vanishing and points of contact emerge between the realms of the
Living and Non-living. Inorganic matter was found anything but inert; it
also was a thrill under the action of multitudinous forces that played
"on it. A universal reaction seemed to bring together metal, plant and"
animal under a common law. They all exhibited essentially the same
"The eminent statesman, Baron Suyematsu, kindly dictated in English to"
one of our editors answers relating to certain questions with regard to
"the relation between Japan and Europe, especially France and Germany."
"With the disclosure of the alleged Kodama report in view, how far"
may one give credit to the alleged Japanese plan of invasion of
Indo-China?
I know all that has been written in France on the subject. All those
"rumours appear to me to have come originally from Russia, and to have"
been put into circulation in order to excite French opinion against
"Japan, in other words, it is nothing else than a mere repetition of the"
Yellow Peril cry.
Japan does not covet Indo-China. I have shown elsewhere that the French
colonies in the Far East have no perceptible influence upon the
"situation of Japan, either from a political or an economical point of"
"view. Japan has sufficient to do at home, she does not want to plunge"
"into external adventures, such as meddling with Indo-China or picking a"
quarrel with a country like France. You may be sure that it would be
more politic for France to cultivate amicable relations with Japan than
irritate her by such accusations. Even if those accusations honestly
"represent the true sentiment of the French, the Japanese would only take"
"them for malicious manœuvres directed to aid Russia, and they could"
not produce any good impression on the minds of the Japanese.
Is there any reason to believe that the so-called Kodama report was
forged in Russia rather than in France?
I have demonstrated elsewhere that the document which was recently made
bleeding spot.
_Empyema._--I may here add the little that I have to say on this
subject. During the whole campaign the single case of primary empyema
"that I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special mention as"
illustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under
the conditions which necessarily accompanied this operation the
"ensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the additional wound no doubt"
proved the source of infection.
"(152) _Entry_, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid"
"muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the"
"surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line"
"of the right side. There was never any hæmoptysis, but the"
patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three
"days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet"
"was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to"
"the Base, a journey of about 600 miles."
"On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and"
"when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was"
"101°, the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole"
"side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of"
boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day
"the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus"
"evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A"
fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to
"improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery."
The following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of
"hæmothorax, and empyema following aspiration:--"
"rocks more than a mile in total thickness, which accumulated"
during the long ages of those periods in a gradually subsiding
trough between the Adirondacks and a pre-Cambrian range lying west
of the Connecticut River. But since their deposition these ancient
"sediments have been crumpled and crushed, broken with great"
"faults, and extensively metamorphosed. The limestones have"
"recrystallized into marbles, among them the famous marbles of"
"Vermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites, and the"
Hudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan
Island and northward.
"In part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for"
in several places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the
upturned Ordovician strata; but recent investigations have made it
"probable that the crustal movements recurred at later times, and"
it was perhaps in the Devonian and at the close of the
Carboniferous that the greater part of the deformation and
"metamorphism was accomplished. As a result of these movements,--"
"perhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain range was"
"upridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but whose"
roots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New
England.
"THE CINCINNATI ANTICLINE. Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and"
"Kentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through"
"Cincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,"
called the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata
thin out as they approach this area and seem never to have
"deposited upon it. We may regard it, therefore, as an island"
upwarped from the sea at the close of the Ordovician or shortly
after.
"home needs, and the industry is as yet largely prosecuted in an"
unsystematic and haphazard manner. It is claimed that sample shipments
"of coffee brought high prices in New York, but as yet not enough is"
"grown to permit exportation. Cacao, which thrives, is grown chiefly by"
"English and German planters, but as yet in a small way only. Cotton,"
tobacco and fiber plants also grow readily in this region but are little
cultivated.

"A curious industry of the Chiriqui country, now nearly abandoned, was"
the collection of gold ornaments which the Guaymi Indians formerly
"buried with their dead. These images sometimes in human form, more often"
"in that of a fish, sometimes like frogs and alligators, jointed and"
"flexible, were at one time found in great quantities and formed a"
conspicuous feature of the Panama curiosity shops. In seeking these the
hunters walked back and forth over the grounds known to be Indian burial
"places, tapping the ground with rods. When the earth gave forth a hollow"
"sound the spade was resorted to, and usually a grave was uncovered. Jars"
"which had contained wine and food were usually found in the graves,"
which were in fact subterranean tombs carefully built with flat stones.
The diggers tell of finding skulls perfectly preserved apparently but
which crumbled to pieces at a touch. Evidently the burial places which
"can be identified through local tradition have been nearly exhausted,"
for the ancient trinkets cannot longer be readily found in the Panama
shops.

of periods when they became more numerous.
ECHINODERMS. This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar
"forms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The"
structure of echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened
with plates or particles of carbonate of lime.
"Of the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin,"
"the former has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but"
neither have so far been discovered in the strata of this period
in North America. The stemmed and lower division of the
"echinoderms was represented by a primitive type, the CYSTOID, so"
"called from its saclike form, A small globular or ovate ""calyx"" of"
"calcareous plates, with an aperture at the top for the mouth,"
"inclosed the body of the animal, and was attached to the sea"
bottom by a short flexible stalk consisting of disks of carbonate
of lime held together by a central ligament.
"ARTHOPODS. These segmented animals with ""jointed feet,"" as their"
"name suggests, may be divided in a general way into water"
breathers and air breathers. The first-named and lower division
"comprises the class of the CRUSTACEA,--arthropods protected by a"
"hard exterior skeleton, or ""crust,""--of which crabs, crayfish, and"
"lobsters are familiar examples. The higher division, that of the"
"air breathers, includes the following classes: spiders, scorpions,"
"centipedes, and insects."
"THE TRILOBITE. The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated"
before the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found
"in the Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in"
"numbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading"
"crustacean type is the TRILOBITE, which takes its name from the"
of English history from the earliest times down to the Revolution of
"1688. This last event inspired him with special interest, because the"

had violated the original contract between prince and people.
Everywhere in his notes Napoleon emphasizes the incidents which led to
"conflicts between dynasties or between rival principles. In fact,"
through all these voracious studies there appear signs of his
"determination to write a history of Corsica; and, while inspiriting"
"his kinsmen by recalling the glorious past, he sought to weaken the"
"French monarchy by inditing a ""Dissertation sur l'Autorité Royale."""
His first sketch of this work runs as follows:
"""23 October, 1788. Auxonne."
"""This work will begin with general ideas as to the origin and the"
enhanced prestige of the name of king. Military rule is favourable
to it: this work will afterwards enter into the details of the
usurped authority enjoyed by the Kings of the twelve Kingdoms of
Europe.
"""There are very few Kings who have not deserved dethronement[12]."""
This curt pronouncement is all that remains of the projected work. It
"sufficiently indicates, however, the aim of Napoleon's studies. One"
and all they were designed to equip him for the great task of
re-awakening the spirit of the Corsicans and of sapping the base of
the French monarchy.
But these reams of manuscript notes and crude literary efforts have an
even wider source of interest. They show how narrow was his outlook on
life. It all turned on the regeneration of Corsica by methods which he
"himself prescribed. We are therefore able to understand why, when his"
"beget children for the State and for Christ, says the lover, children"
"endowed by their upright parents with a good disposition, children who"
see the good example at home which is to guide them. Again and again he
reverts to the mother's duty to suckle the child herself. He indicates
"how the house should be arranged, in a simple and cleanly manner; he"
occupies himself with the problem of useful children's dress. Who stood
"up at that time, as he did, for the fallen girl, and for the prostitute"
compelled by necessity? Who saw so clearly the social danger of
"marriages of persons infected with the new scourge of Europe, so"
violently abhorred by Erasmus? He would wish that such a marriage should
at once be declared null and void by the Pope. Erasmus does not hold
"with the easy social theory, still quite current in the literature of"
"his time, which casts upon women all the blame of adultery and lewdness."
"With the savages who live in a state of nature, he says, the adultery of"
"men is punished, but that of women is forgiven."
"Here it appears, at the same time, that Erasmus knew, be it half in"
"jest, the conception of natural virtue and happiness of naked islanders"
in a savage state. It soon crops up again in Montaigne and the following
centuries develop it into a literary dogma.
CHAPTER XIII
ERASMUS'S MIND-CONTINUED
Erasmus's mind: Intellectual tendencies--The world encumbered by
beliefs and forms--Truth must be simple--Back to the pure
sources--Holy Scripture in the original languages--Biblical
humanism--Critical work on the texts of Scripture--Practice
"and, according to instructions, looked the accountant officer"
"squarely in the face and gave his name and rating. Then, receiving"
"his money in the crown of his cap, the recipient saluted and moved"
away to make room for the next man.
All was proceeding smoothly and with the regularity of clockwork when
suddenly a diversion occurred.
The ship's company had a mascot in the shape of a young African
"monkey, that had been presented to the ""Sunderland"" by a French"
cruiser during a visit to an Algerian port. Although usually
"good-tempered ""Mephisto"" could and did exhibit fits of sulkiness and"
outbursts of insubordination that would have earned a lower deck man
"ninety days' ""confined to detention quarters."" But the monkey being a"
"sort of chartered libertine, was idolized by the ship's company and"
mildly tolerated by the officers.
Mephisto was lazily sunning himself under the lee of the quarter-deck
6-in gun shield when his eye caught sight of the chief writer's
"silver watch, which that petty officer had occasion to consult."
Probably the monkey imagined that it was one of the tins of condensed
milk for which he had great partiality.
"Getting on his four feet Mephisto ambled across the quarter-deck,"
past the line of men drawn up at attention. Before he could cross the
"chalk line, a symbol for which he had no respect, the chief writer"
had replaced his timepiece.
Foiled in that direction the monkey made a grab at a pile of brand
"new copper coins, and before any of the officers and men could"
"prevent, had made a rush for the weather-shrouds."
"If it is a double foetus with five feet, serious hostility in the"
"country, the house of the man will perish, his stall[45] will be"
destroyed.
"If it is a double foetus with six feet, the population will be"
"diminished, confusion in the land."
"If it is a foetus within a foetus, the king will weaken his enemy,"
his possessions will be brought into the palace[46].
*       *       *       *       *
"If a foetus gives birth to a second foetus[47], the king will assert"
himself against his opponent.
It will be observed that in quite a number of cases two alternative
"interpretations are given, one of an official character referring to the"
"public welfare, or to occurrences in the royal household[48], the other of"
an unofficial character bearing on the welfare of the individual to whom
the mother lamb that had produced the monstrosity belonged. One foetus
"issuing from the other, or one within the other, appears to have been a"
"favorable or an unfavorable sign, according to the position of the second."
"If the one lay above the other, the association of ideas pointed to a"
"control of the ruler over his enemy. In some cases, the association of"
ideas leading to the interpretation is not clear; and we must perhaps
assume in such instances an entry of an event that =actually= occurred
after the birth of the monstrosity in question. A certain measure of
arbitrariness in the interpretations also constitutes a factor to be taken
into consideration; and the last thing that we need to expect in any
system of divination is a =consistent= application of any principle
whatsoever.
"his nose, completed Mephisto's brief spell of unalloyed liberty."
Temporarily stunned by the terrific concussion the monkey relaxed his
grip and fell.
"Just at that moment the staff-paymaster, who was scurrying below with"
"one of the pay-trays, happened to be passing in the direct line of"
Mephisto's descent. The next instant the portly officer was rolling
on the deck in a puddle of condensed milk with the monkey's paws
"clutching at his scanty crop of hair, while to complete the"
staff-paymaster's discomfiture most of the money he was carrying
rolled overboard.
Regaining his feet Staff-paymaster Staggles contrived to reach the
"companion, and with Mephisto still firmly attached to him,"
disappeared below.
But the men's attention was now directed towards more serious
matters. An ever-diverging line that rippled the placid water denoted
the approach of a deadly torpedo. Now it was heading as if about to
"hit the bows of the ""Sunderland,"" a second later and the arrow-like"
"ripples seemed to be approaching directly abeam; then, as the cruiser"
swung almost on her heel the wake of the formidable missile was
merged into the churning froth astern. It had missed by a bare yard.
From the fire-control platform telephone bells were clanging and men
shouting through the voice-tubes. From their elevated position the
"watchers could discern a long, dark shadow that marked the position"
of the submarine.
"Completely circling the ""Sunderland"" was steadied on her helm and"
steered straight for the spot. In vain the submerged craft attempted
to dive to a depth greater than that of her enemy's draught.
"the story of the great Hermits who, having listened to the discussion"
of the Monday sitting at the Académie des Sciences (Institut de France)
as to the best way to teach the young how to shoot in the direction
"of mathematical genius, said: “_Cultivez l'imagination, messieurs."
"Tout est là. Si vous voulez des mathématiciens, donnez à vos enfants à"
lire--des Contes de Fées._”
Another important effect of the story is to develop at an early
age sympathy for children of other countries where conditions are
different from our own. There is a book used in American schools
"called “Little Citizens of other Lands,” dealing with the clothes,"
the games and occupations of those little citizens. Stories of this
kind are particularly necessary to prevent the development of insular
"notions, and are a check on that robust form of Philistinism, only"
"too prevalent, alas! among grown-ups, which looks askance at new"
suggestions and makes the withering remark: “How un-English! How
"queer!”--the second comment being, it would seem, a natural corollary"
to the first.[40]
I have so constantly to deal with the question of confusion between
Truth and Fiction in the mind of children that it might be useful
to offer here an example of the way they make the distinction for
themselves.
Mrs. Ewing says on this subject:
“If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of
"distinguishing between Fancy and Falsehood, it is most desirable to"
"develop in them the power to do so, but, as a rule, in childhood,"
we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which as elders our
care-clogged memories fail to recall.”
the religious orders. To these were joined the northern parts of Navarra
"and the Basque countries whose privileges had been threatened, together"
with large districts of the ever-turbulent provinces of Aragon and
Catalunia.
Round the Queen-Regent and her little daughter collected all the liberal
"opinion of the peninsula, most of the foreign sympathy, the influence of"
"the great towns and sea-ports, of the capital and the government"
"officials, the regular army and police with their officers--indeed all"
the organised and stated machinery of government.
But up to the time of our history these advantages had been to some
extent neutralised by the ill-success of the governmental generalship
and by the brilliant successes of two great Carlist leaders--Tomas
Zumalacarregui and Ramon Cabrera.
These men perfectly understood the conditions of warfare among their
"native mountains, and had inflicted defeat upon defeat on every Cristino"
general sent against them.
But a cloud had of late overspread the fair prospects of the party.
"Their great general, Tomas Zumalacarregui, had been killed by a cannon"
"ball at the siege of Bilbao, and Cabrera, though unsurpassed as a"
"guerrilla leader, had not the swift Napoleonic judgment and breadth of"
"view of his predecessor. Add to this that a new premier, Mendizábal, and"
"a new general, Espartero, were directing operations from Madrid. The"
"former, already half English, had begun to carry out his great scheme of"
filling the pockets of the civil and military authorities by conveying
to the government all the property belonging to the religious orders
"throughout Spain, who, like our friend the Abbot of Montblanch, had"
resolutely and universally espoused the cause of Don Carlos.
stimulates the heart and increases the functional activity of all
"organs, especially the kidneys and skin."
"Large or too long continued doses derange the appetite and digestion,"
congest or inflame the stomach and liver. Eight ounces of alcohol killed
a horse. Alcohol is poisonous and should be used with caution.
"USES.--Are numerous, used principally as a stimulant, either in one"
"large dose, 2 to 3 ounces of alcohol, or better, in small repeated"
"doses, 1 ounce every 1, 2 or 3 hours, can be conjoined with other"
"stimulants such as sulphuric ether, aromatic spirits of ammonia,"
"digitalis, etc."
"It is used in anesthetic mixtures, such as alcohol, ether and"
"chloroform, combined in different proportions; in snake bites it is"
administered in very large doses.
"In blood poisoning alcohol is a most potent drug, sustaining the heart,"
lowering the temperature and acting as a germicide. Alcohol makes an
"excellent dressing for wounds; applied locally to threatened bed-sores,"
frequently prevents their formation. It is useful in colds at their
"outset, or in a chill to restore the balance of the circulation and"
prevent or overcome internal congestion by relaxing the blood vessels of
the periphery.
"All alcoholic liquors are useful in debilitating diseases, such as"
"influenza, in two or three ounce doses repeated every three or four"
"hours. One-half to one drachm of quinine to one ounce of alcohol, for"
"influenza or febrile diseases in general, excepting brain and spinal"
disease; useful in convalescence. In colic alcohol can be used with a
great degree of success; it will act as a carminative antispasmodic and
"stimulant, used in collapse and weak heart; in septicaemia and pyaemia"
intestine area without inflicting any injury.
"The sum of my experience, in fact, was to encourage the belief that,"
unless the intestine was struck in such a direction as to render lateral
"displacement an impossibility, the gut often escaped perforation."
"As a rule, the wounds of the abdomen which from their position proved"
the most dangerous to the intestine were--
"1. Wounds passing from one flank to the other were very dangerous, as"
"crossing complicated coils of the small intestine, and two fixed"
portions of the colon. This danger was most marked when the wounds were
situated between the eighth rib in the mid axillary line and the crest
"of the ilium; above this level the liver, or possibly liver and stomach,"
"were sometimes alone implicated, and the cases did well. Again, when the"
wounds crossed the false pelvis the patients sometimes escaped all
injury to viscera.
2. Antero-posterior wounds in the small intestine area were very fatal
if the course was direct; in such the small intestine seldom escaped
injury.
3. Wounds with a certain degree of obliquity from anterior wall to
"flank, or from flank to loin, were on the other hand comparatively"
"favourable, as the small intestine often escaped, and if any gut was"
"wounded, it was often the colon."
"4. Vertical wounds implicating the chest and abdomen, or the abdomen and"
"pelvis, were on the whole not very unfavourable. For instance, when the"
"bullet entered by the buttock and emerged below the umbilicus, a number"
of patients escaped fatal injury; this depended on the comparatively
good prognosis in wounds of the rectum and bladder. A good many
reaction of these various weak solutions upon one another and upon
the walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of vein stuffs and
ores.
As an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the
"case of a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines, Nevada, to"
"carry the hot water of the mine from one level to another, which"
in ten years was lined with calcium carbonate more than half an
inch thick.
"The Steamboat Springs, Nevada, furnish examples of mineral veins"
in process of formation. The steaming water rises through fissures
in volcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone
"of quartz, with metallic ores of iron, mercury, lead, and other"
metals.
RECONCENTRATION. Near the base of the zone of solution veins are
often stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits.
This local enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of
its metalliferous ores. As the surface of the land is slowly
"lowered by weathering and running water, the zone of solution is"
lowered at an equal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of
cementation. The minerals of veins are therefore constantly being
dissolved along their upper portions and carried down the fissures
"by ground water to lower levels, where they are redeposited."
Many of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive
concentrations: the ores were leached originally from the rocks to
a large extent by laterally seeping waters; they were concentrated
in the ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents;
they have been reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just
mentioned.
"single-line title was the only title which existed, but as time went"
"on the demand of the public, on the one hand, for a decorated page at"
"the beginning of the book, together with the printer's desire, on the"
"other hand, to advertise himself, developed the bastard-title into the"
"dimensions of the title-page which we now know, containing the name"
"of the book, the name of the author, the publisher's device, and the"
publisher's name and address. At the present time the bastard-title is
used more to add elegance to the appearance of the volume than for any
"practical purpose, it being pleasanter for the eye to rest first upon"
"this page rather than at once upon the title-page, which extends over"
the full dimensions of the type area.
ADVERTISING CARD
"If an advertising card or limit notice is required, this page of"
display should be set up with careful consideration of the page it is
"to face, and of the typography of the book of which it is to be a part."
"Too frequently advertising cards are looked upon as separate jobs, and"
are set in types which do not harmonize with the typography of the rest
of the book.
TITLE-PAGE
The title-page offers the printer and the publisher a tempting
"opportunity for display and for artistic typography, and too few"
"realize the value of restraint. Cobden-Sanderson once remarked, as"
"explaining the high prices which he secures for his work, that he"
always charges more for what he leaves out than for what he puts in.
"The earliest volumes lacked the title-page, because vellum and"
"the Admiralty to authorise, and the Admiralty may thereupon by warrant"
"authorise, either a Vice-Admiralty court or a Colonial Court of"
"Admiralty, within the meaning of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act,"
"1890, to act as a prize court in a British possession, or may in like"
manner establish a Vice-Admiralty court for the purpose of so acting;
"and any court so authorised shall, subject to the terms of the warrant"
"from the Admiralty, have all such jurisdiction as is by this Act"
conferred on the High Court as a prize court.
"Commissions. [57 & 58 Vict. c. 39, s. 2 (1), (2).]"
"4.--(1) Any commission, warrant, or instructions from His Majesty the"
King or the Admiralty for the purpose of commissioning a prize court at
"any place in a British possession may, notwithstanding the existence of"
"peace, be issued at any time, with a direction that the court shall act"
only upon such proclamation as herein-after mentioned being made in the
possession.
"(2) Where any such commission, warrant, or instructions have been"
"issued, then, subject to instructions from His Majesty the Vice-Admiral"
"of such possession may, when satisfied by information from a Secretary"
of State or otherwise that war has broken out between His Majesty and
"any foreign State, proclaim that war has so broken out, and thereupon"
"the said commission, warrant, and instructions shall take effect as if"
the same had been issued after the breaking out of such war and such
foreign State were named therein.
"(3) Any such commission, warrant, or instructions may be revoked or"
altered from time to time.

to the chamber of bright-haired Persephone which none may escape.’
"There is naturally here a note of lament, as befits any epitaph, and"
more especially that of one who dies young and unmarried; but none
"the less there is an anticipation--justified, we may think, if we"
"will, by some ceremony of bridal ablution performed for the dead man"
by his friends--that his death is a wedding with the goddess of the
"under-world; and indeed the phrase Φερσεφόνης θάλαμος, ‘the bridal"
"chamber of Persephone,’ recurs with some frequency in this class of"
epitaphs[1502].
"Considered collectively, such epitaphs would suggest a distinctly"
"offensive conception of Persephone; but in each taken separately, as"
"it was composed, it will be allowed, I think, that if there is supreme"
"audacity, there is equal sublimity. It is just these qualities which"
"give pungency to a blasphemous parody of such epitaphs, in which the"
wit of Ausonius exposes the worst possible aspect of a religious
conception which to the pure-minded was wholly pure. My apology for
quoting lines which I will not translate must be the fact that a
caricature is often no less instructive than a true portrait. The mock
epitaph concludes as follows:
Sed neque functorum socius miscebere vulgo
Nec metues Stygios flebilis umbra lacus:
"Verum aut Persephonae Cinyreius ibis Adonis,"
Aut Jovis Elysii tu catamitus eris[1503].
Ausonius in jest bears an unpleasant resemblance to Clement in earnest;
both perverted to their uttermost a doctrine which commanded nothing
but reverence from faithful participants in the mysteries.
Akin to these epitaphs are certain tablets which recently have been
"fully discussed by Miss Jane Harrison[1504], and have been shown to"
"Erasmus's mind: Ethical and aesthetic tendencies, aversion to"
"all that is unreasonable, silly and cumbrous--His vision of"
antiquity pervaded by Christian faith--Renascence of good
learning--The ideal life of serene harmony and happy
wisdom--Love of the decorous and smooth--His mind neither
"philosophic nor historical, but strongly philological and"
"moralistic--Freedom, clearness, purity, simplicity--Faith in"
nature--Educational and social ideas
What made Erasmus the man from whom his contemporaries expected their
"salvation, on whose lips they hung to catch the word of deliverance? He"
"seemed to them the bearer of a new liberty of the mind, a new clearness,"
"purity and simplicity of knowledge, a new harmony of healthy and right"
"living. He was to them as the possessor of newly discovered, untold"
wealth which he had only to distribute.
What was there in the mind of the great Rotterdamer which promised so
much to the world?
The negative aspect of Erasmus's mind may be defined as a heartfelt
"aversion to everything unreasonable, insipid, purely formal, with which"
the undisturbed growth of medieval culture had overburdened and
overcrowded the world of thought. As often as he thinks of the
"ridiculous text-books out of which Latin was taught in his youth,"
"disgust rises in his mind, and he execrates them--Mammetrectus,"
"Brachylogus, Ebrardus and all the rest--as a heap of rubbish which ought"
"to be cleared away. But this aversion to the superannuated, which had"
"become useless and soulless, extended much farther. He found society,"
"and especially religious life, full of practices, ceremonies, traditions"
"and conceptions, from which the spirit seemed to have departed. He does"
"They irritate the nose when inhaled, but reflexly they stimulate the"
"circulation and respiration, they are good stimulants as they do not"
affect the brain. The aromatic spirits of ammonia is also a carminative.
"Externally they are rubefacients, and when confined are vesicants."
USES.--Its antacid and stimulant properties recommend ammonia in
"indigestion, tympanites, and spasmodic colic, especially in cattle and"
"sheep. Stimulating the spinals and respiratory systems, it is valuable"
"in the treatment of influenza, pneumonia, pleurisy and similar"
complaints. The fumes of ammonia are occasionally used to arouse animals
"from shocks, collapse, or chloroform intoxication, but must be used"
"cautiously, lest excessive irritation of the respiratory mucous membrane"
"be produced. It is a promptly acting antidote in poisoning by opium,"
"aconite, digitalis, and ether narcotic and sedative drugs. It may be"
"administered much diluted in the usual way, injected subcutaneously and"
"intravenously, and also applied externally, in the treatment of"
"snake-bites. On account of its producing bronchial secretion, and"
"assisting in its expulsion, ammonia is serviceable as a stimulating"
expectorant. To develop its more general effects its alcoholic
proportions should be prescribed as spirit of ammonia or the aromatic
"spirit of ammonia. Externally used in the form of liniment of ammonia,"
"with oils, camphor, etc., proves useful as a stimulant in rheumatism,"
"stiff-joints, muscular strains, sore throat, pleurisy, pneumonia and"
"influenza, and for preventing the rapid chilling of fomented surfaces."
"It relieves the irritation caused by nettles, and by bites and stings of"
insects.

"You see, because last year when I came from Blitzen, Washington to Los Angeles, it cost $26.40."
"Now it doesn't seem fair to go from Los Angeles to Blitzen, Washington for $31.10, so I think something's wrong."
"Plus the fact, this is all the money I have."
I saved it up.
Rates went up last February.
"Please, I'm in a hurry."
"I'm sorry, lady, but..."
(GRUNTS)
Look.
Chicago.
"One ticket for me and one half-fare, please."
The boy under 12?
"Oh, yes."
I'm 11 years old.
Ooh!
"I was born February 22nd, 1943."
(GASPING)
He's a little big for 11.
"Sure, I'm a sailor."
"YOU KNOW, UM, DO A ""DAY IN THE LIFE"" KIND OF THING."
"WELL, OUR MEETINGS ARE USUALLY CONFIDENTIAL,"
BUT I'M SURE WE CAN ARRANGE SOMETHING.
"LOOK, I GOT TO GET JAMES TO SCHOOL."
YOU GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
YES.
WHEN ARE YOU RUNNING?
MAMA'S GONNA PICK YOU UP.
YOUR FATHER SEEMS TO THINK HE'LL GO FAR
IF HE CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME.
"OH, HE'S JUST SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS MOTHER, THAT'S ALL."
"MM, WELL, I THINK HE'S INTIMIDATED"
BY THE SIZE OF MY REPUTATION.
HMM?
HOW ARE YOU TWO DOING?
GREAT.
"THINGS ARE A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT WE'RE GREAT."
"WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT."
THERE'S A PIECE ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE
"OH, YEAH?"
I NEED TO WATCH THAT.
THEY MENTION ME?
"NO, THEY WEREN'T SINGLING ANYBODY OUT."
YOU WANT ME TO RECORD IT?
SAM?
"UH, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT."
THANKS.
IS THERE A HISTORY OF CANCER IN YOUR FAMILY?
"UH, MY MOTHER DIED FROM LIVER CANCER."
"BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A HEAVY SMOKER AND BIG DRINKER."
AND YOU GUYS -- WORST ROBOTS I'VE EVER SEEN.
WE FAILED AT OUR MISSION.
OUR COVER IS BLOWN.
"IF THIS HUMAN KNOWS, HE'LL TELL THE OTHERS."
ARE YOU KIDDING?
AND WASTE THE CHANCE TO KNOW SOMETHING THEY DON'T?
SOMETHING THIS HUGE?
"I'M THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO YOUR MISSION,"
'CAUSE I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EARTH.
CAN YOU TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE MY HUMAN STOP YELLING?
DANI?
I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN DO THAT.
"I'M CODY, BY THE WAY."
I'M BLADES.
BOULDER.
CLASSIFIED.
THAT'S CHASE.
AND I'M HEATWAVE.
"SO, CODY, NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE,"
NAME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE THIS PLANET RIGHT NOW.
THERE'S TUNNELS LIKE THIS ONE ALL OVER THE ISLAND.
AND THEY ALL END IN THE BUNKER.
GREAT FOR SNEAKING OUT OF THE FIRE HOUSE.
Boulder:
WHOA.
IT'S LIKE A MILLION OPTICS SET IN CARBON.
SO BEAUTIFUL.
I GUESS IT KIND OF IS.
"SO, WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO LEAVE?"
THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE WILL EXPECT YOU TO ACT LIKE.
"Yeah, ha-ha, that's me."
"-Good boy, Meathead."
"-Ah, if I could do it, you must be worth a million."
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?
Have a little more champagne.
That's a boy.
You worked pretty hard waiting on tables all day.
I'm taking care of you here.
How do you like him?
He still remembers me when I was a busboy.
"Yeah... he-he-he's way up there now, Bilk."
"Oh, really, made waiter, huh?"
Good boy.
"Lean back, take it easy."
"I'm gonna take good care of you, pappy."
"That's all he does all day-- sit back, counting the receipts of his 200 restaurants."
"-Yeah, yeah."
-200 restaurants?
"Yeah, G  G Sandwich Shops."
-That's right.
-G  G?
-Yeah.
-That's his?
-(laughing):
Yeah.
I eat there all the time.
"That is, when I'm not too busy eating at Toots Shor's or Stork Club."
(all laughing)
"Hey, listen, you poor souls, no use renting a room."
"You three guys can stay with me here, all right?"
"Well, thanks, Bilko."
I didn't mean to hurt you.
"Sara, I would never do anything to hurt you."
I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
- You wanna go ?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where l live.
This is my dad's music room.
- He plays the trumpet.
- No shit.
[ Laughs ] He's actually pretty good if you like jazz.
No.
He's got some nice stereo equipment.
It's off the hook.
Huh.
And this is our living room.
- lt's not anything special.
- lt's all right.
My dad's gonna flix that.
It's kind of messy in there.
- Do you wanna see my room ?
"- Uh, yeah."
- This is it. I sleep on the couch.
- [ Laughs ]
"There's a bed underneath, but it gets stuck, and my dad says he's gonna flix it, but I don't know."
"He's, um, at work right now."
He'll... be gone all night.
"Yeah, um--"
[Siren Wailing ln Distance] I'd sleep in a dresser too if I had six brothers to sleep with.
Why don't you take it?
I don't know.
It was Bennet's.
- I'd feel weird.
- Carrie...
"It's not your fault, what happened to him."
It's Bennet's.
You did a good job.
You should own that.

"-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola."
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?
"Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?"
"-Who's that, honey?"
"-Listen good, Fredo."
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal.
"-Oh, God."
-Will he come alone?
I don't know.
You've got me in deep enough already.
Everything will be all right.
Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal.
"All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys."
You lied to me.
I don't want you to call me anymore.
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
"-Frankie, I've got nobody here."
"-Wait in the car, Cicc'."
-Frankie.
"-That's okay, Cicc'."
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie.
Give us a taste.
"We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie."
-You won't regret it.
"Like with some people, you know what I mean?"
-That's what love is built on.
-Si.
So why did you come back?
You said you'd take me to CompUSA so I could get a new Magic Stick.
And I will.
I got stuff to do.
I told you.
I'd better get going.
Thank you very much for the vinegar.
Where's Branca?
She jump ship already?
She's in hospital for a while.
Cyst.
Where's the old fart?
I gotta talk to him.
It's his afternoon nap.
You want me to wake him?
Give him a while.
Want some wine?
From Furio's uncle in Italy?
He says they had a lot of sun in this year.
Salute.
It needs ice.
I'm going to watch the Bloomberg.
-What's all that?
-I'm making a website for my business.
You know how to do that?
I'm going to pay somebody... $35 an hour?
"I stuck, I call Bill."
You got married yet?
Maybe when he gets back from Port St. Lucie.
"Gibbs, Lance Corporal Finn's fiancée's upstairs."
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"How, Doctor?"
"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?
Red hair.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
What do you want me to do?
"If you kill them,"
Boss will reward you handsomely.
"Before I do so,"
I want to get my hands on So Seo-No that wrectch.
"As you wish, Commander,"
I just want to get rid of them.
"Then I'll leave this to you, Commander."
Have a safe trip.
-Let's go.
-Yes.
Are we really going to kill them?
"If what he said is true, if he really is a Prince of BuYeo"
We'll get into deep trouble.
Capturing So Seo-No is our first priority.
"Han-Dang that rascal, I'm going to kill him."
Really?
Is that true?
"Yes, it is."
"Besides Ju-Mong, we have Oh-Yi, Ma-Ri, and Hyeop-Bo too."
We might even have a chance of nabbing So Seo-No.
I'm...
I'm...going to be rich!
"Eh wait, why am I still sitting here?"
I'm off to tell Prince Young-Po the good news.
-Han-Dang...
-Yes.
I got it.
Your Highness...
Yeo Mi-Eul!
Yeo Mi-Eul!
What are you standing around for?
She's got a Firebird and two horses!
We could've raced 'em!
All right.
That's it.
I'm gonna go askJake Bradley.
I know.
"We've all been thinking it, but no one's had the guts to ask him... 'cause he's the quarterback, and we're a bunch of jelly heads."
But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.
And that star is Jake Bradley!
Jake Bradley!
"All right, Fez."
There's Nina.
"Now remember, you're a new man."
You don't need her or anything else.
- Got it.
"I am cooler, suaver, aloofer."
- There you go.
"- Oh, hi, Fez."
"- Oh, you wish, baby."
"Why don't you take your ""Hi, Fez"" act and try it on someone else?"
'Cause I don't need it.
"- Nice work, Fez."
- Shut up.
I don't need your accolades.
"How can you give away your stuffing recipe, Kitty?"
It's the one thing that we have that's better than everyone else's.
Our house?
Crappier.
Our son?
Crappier.
Our stuffing?
Horace.
"-Good night, ma belle."
-Good night.
"-Good night, Horace."
-Good night.
You make an awfully handsome couple.
Naturally.
I'm married to the second prettiest girl in New York.
-Good night.
-Good night.
"Everything is all right with them now, isn't it, Horace?"
"I think so, Nora."
It's worked itself out.
"-Fun, wasn't it?"
-I love our Thursday nights.
"You're such a lamb, flirting with mother, asking just the right questions."
But I do wish you could come home with me.
So do I.
"I don't think I'll be very late, darling."
It's just a question of reminding Frank that he's a reasonably honest man.
-Shall I wait up for you?
"-Yes, do."
We'll have a nightcap together.
We might even hold hands.
"-Your car is here, Mr. Belney."
"-Oh, thank you."
-Can I drop you?
-It's early.
I think I'll stop in at the Del Rio for a drink.
Join me?
"No, but I'll take you there."
But I'd much rather you went home and worried about me.
HOLD THAT THERE.
"WHEN I SAY,""NOW,"" YOU'RE GONNA OPEN THAT DOOR."
NOW!
"SHOOT A PROPANE TANK,"
AND YOU'LL JUST GET A BIG POT OF COLD GAS.
YOU NEED AN OPEN FLAME AND REAL GOOD AIM.
GET DOWN!
"YEAH,SAM, I HAD TO DRIVE AROUND,"
MAKE SURE WE WEREN'T FOLLOWED.
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE NOW.
GOT TO GO.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE'LL GET TO THAT.
I NEED TO KNOW WHY SOMEONE WANTS YOU DEAD.
IT'S A LONG STORY.
"WELL,IT'S A LONG STORY"
"THAT STARTS WITH GREENWAY CARGO,RIGHT?"
GIVE ME THE SHORT VERSION FOR NOW.
I WAS THE CONTROLLER --
"MOSTLY WROTE CHECKS, DID INVOICES."
IT WAS A JOB.
I'VE BEEN A CPA FOR 15 YEARS.
NEED TO GET TO THE MARKED-FOR-DEATH PART.
"AFTER A WHILE,"
I REALIZED I WAS PAYING VENDORS I HAD NEVER HEARD OF
FOR CARGO THAT WAS NEVER DELIVERED.
FRONT COMPANIES?
THEY WERE INTO ALL KINDS OF STUFF --
"WEAPONS,IVORY,HUMAN CARGO."
THAT'S WHAT THE FBI SAID.
"ANYWAY, THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE,"
"SAID THEY WERE INVESTIGATING THE COMPANY,INVESTIGATING ME."
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Are you expecting somebody?
No.
Can I talk to my sister for a minute?
It's okay.
I had this whole speech planned. so-- wait wait.
Just-- what I'm trying to say is that l-- but it wasn't for lack of trying.
Dad split... and Mom passed away.
And we got stuck with Rod.
And... you know?
I'm not your responsibility anymore.
I know that.
That's what I came here to say.
I know you're not a little girl anymore.
And... you-- you grew up to be this really beautiful woman.
And you deserve better.
And I'm gonna have to learn to let you go. but I'm gonna try.

He's not such a bad guy.
I know.
He's not.

"No,I did."

"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."

"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
What are you doing?
I'm leavin'.
I have to get out of here.
"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"
You!
Help!
Quiet or I'll kill you right here.
"Driving back, he saw you driving in front of him with Byron in the car."
Where had you and Byron been at 4:00 a.m.?
We've been here all night.

He's old.
He don't see so well.

You sure?
-You didn't see a pretty lady?
-No.
You sure?

-Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
And you really should spend a night in jail.
So you can tell your sister.
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
What's going to happen to our baby with me in jail?
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
I'll give her money for him.
Have something sweet.
"Thank you so much, aunt Anka."
"I'll be off, then."
"Wait, I've got something else."
- What is it?
- Take a look.
Thank you so much.
You really piled up a heap.
"I didn't peel this off, I was afraid to tear the stamp."
- You'll do a better job.
- Thank you so much.
"I asked the neighbours, too."
I know that you collect these things.

I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now.
I'm clean.
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"After what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help.
I really do.
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
$3.200.
That's what he gave me.
$3.200 for a lifetime.
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
- We got to get out.
- I don't want to run.
I don't want to.
Am I supposed to just pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.

"Yes, I would."
Hi.
"Hi, Andy."
"Hi, boss."
Hi.
Did you hear that?
That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
-You're going to die?
-Transform.
Don't go.
I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
"I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl."
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice.
I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
"He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him."
I'm his daughter.
I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
"Alice, at last."
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
"You called it ""Wonderland,"" as I recall."
Wonderland.
(WATCH TICKING)
-What do you call yourself?
-Alice.
The Alice?
"Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it."
McTWISP:
She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
"Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please."
Have some tea.
"You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem, stupid girl."
Look at this.

I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.

That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
"WELL, WHEN WILL YOU KNOW?"
"I don't know, but, um, I-I can make a note to call you."
"UH, OKAY."
Is there another girl you'd be interested in?
Did you look at Donna on our Website?
She's available.
"DONNA, YEAH."

"She was born without a tongue, clark."

I know the feeling.

Now you`re talking.
I`m going steady.
And I French kiss.

"Yeah, but Daddy says I`m the best."

It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home.
It was Roth all along.
"He acts like I'm his son, his successor."
But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out.
-How can I help?
"-Just go along, as if you know nothing."
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
"You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow."
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English.
"-Gracias, señor."
-Buenas noches.
"-Honey, go to the casino."
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay.
"Nice to see you, Mr. Paul."
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money.
Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to...
Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
"I know, but who gave the go-ahead?"
I know I didn't.
We'd better go back to the Doctor.
-Where did you get that?
-It's too small for me.
-What is it?
-It's a present.
-I've been trying to get it off.
-Who from?
-I hope you haven't broken it.
-Nyssa.
"Adric, Nyssa, come on."
Doctor!
I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently.
"You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is."
-That's the man who brought me from Traken.
-Yes.
He said he was a friend of yours.
-But he's the man on the bridge.
-Yes.
-You said to be prepared for the worst.
"-Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst."
"Why are you prepared for the worst, Doctor?"
Because he's here.
Please remain where you are.
I have it in my power to bring Logopolis to a complete halt.
There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
"Yes, that's how they built a replica of the Pharos Project."
"Yes, yes, but why?"
Hmm?
Why build a replica of the Pharos Project?
Central Register.
Listen.
-I don't...
Mama!
Calm down.
This was a bad idea.
Hop out.
"Good for you, Jay."
It has to be when he is ready.
- Nope.
He's driving.
- What?
- What?
I-I can't.
- You're doing it now.
"Jesús, take the wheel."
He's terrified to be in the back.
Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?
!
Can you not make this fear worse?
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.
"Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time..."
Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.
"Manny, you don't want to do this right?"
"No, I really don't."
"Okay, papi, you know what?"
Let's switch.
I'm going to drive.
"I've got a bombshell, mom."
"Ay, papi, thank you, but this is a very weird thing to say when we're in this position."
"No, I've decided I'm never driving."
Uh... unh-unh-unh-unh!
No way.
You there.
You there.
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.
I put it in here to keep it fresh.
Can we leave this open to get some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It was in September.
I missed it.
I left him with Mama before he was two years old.
That means I've missed four birthdays so we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about....
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?
You should have some of our baby's cake--
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
"Damn it, I told you I didn't want any."
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.
"Cut it out, goddamn it!"
Why did you ever fuck with me?
I'm about halfway through.

"We wanted to say ""thank you,"" so we cooked for you."
[Laughs]
And at what ungodly temperature did we cook these eggs?
"Um, the temperature you cook eggs at... high."

So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
I'm here for a few days.
- My cell number's on there.
- Of course.
"Were you and your aunt, uh, close?"
For most of my life she was a birthday card with a $5 bill in it.
But she never missed a birthday.
I understand.
How about you?
How well did you know my aunt?
My great-aunt.
Oh.
She came in once a year.
- Like Santa Claus.
- Heh.
She was very sweet.
"When I called, they told me that you had spoken to her just before she died."
I'd like to know what you thought of her.
- I don't know what I could tell you.
- We could talk about it over drinks.
Uh...
I don't know.
Heh.
Consider it.
You've got the number.
I will get these to the Revenue office.
Thank you.
I didn't know my dad was coming.
He wanted to know how somebody could beat me.

I didn't.
You know I didn't.
I told him we tied but you got the slot.

Two million dollars on the seat next to me.

What's going on?
I'm totally in the dark.
The family is making an investment in Havana.
This is a gift for the President.
That's great!
Havana's great.
It's my kind of town.
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know.
"Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?"
No.
I've never met them.
"Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of..."
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?
I thought maybe we'd go out together.
I know a place where we can spend some time together.
Sometimes I think I should have married a woman like you did.

Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.

"Hey, I'm Blake."
"I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it."
"And I'm married, butt pirate."
Hey.

"We're all friends, here."
No need for the name calling.

"Why is Brock frightened, Sarah Beth;"
Doesn't he know Mac can get him off;
"Yes, Papa, he knows that, but he knows he can't get you off."
"The man Brock shot, he called Brock names."
"Not pretty names, either."
They'd sound awful at a trial.
Especially when they're true.
Brock thought-- He wanted to spare you something.
He can't spare me anything.
It seems none of us can spare the others anything.
"You go to bed, Sarah Beth."
I've got to find him.
I've got to get to him before he does something.
I've got to get to him before some sheriff gets him.
"He's a good boy, Sarah Beth."
"Yes, I'm glad we know how good."
"You find him, Papa."
I'll find him.

"Frankie, she's got crazy eyes."
Crazy eyes?
It's like she's having a panic attack in her eyes.

"You understand, right?"
No.
"No, I don't understand."
"My daughter is a person with hopes and feelings, and... (Lowered voice) I was told everybody gets in."
It's true.
All the kids get in.
"However, all the kids don't necessarily stay in."
"Well, you could have put that in the flyer."
(Sighs) Please.
You don't get it.
She never makes anything.
You can't tell her this.
She'll be crushed.
"Oh, wow."
You're right.
That's why you should be the one to tell her.

- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.

"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"

Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!

"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"

One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
I'm ashamed now.
"But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie."
You're all I got.
"And I really, really need your help. I really do."
Take this.
And now I've got to turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
"$3,200 for a lifetime."
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
"I don't want to do that, Henry."
Is that what you want?
"Karen, lf we stay around here we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
-You know what kind of questions they been asking him?
-l don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.

"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."

I'll make him talk.
He's not gonna talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
"How are you this morning, Byron?"
Just fine.
Pretty sleepy?
"Yeah, I guess so."
Did you go stay someplace with your uncle Ronnie last night?
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
"You didn't see a lady, a pretty lady?"
No.
You sure?
Yeah.
Did your uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
Yeah.
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
Okay.
"And I think you really ought to spend a night or two in jail, so you don't tell your sister."
Dale...
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.

At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.

"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.

"- Jerry's a good guy, so don't..."
"No, I'm not."
"It's just that,"
"I mean, man, it's gotta hurt."
"One time I kissed this girl who I was,"
- I had such a crush on...
- I don't need to hear this.
- I had to watch you kissing Jerry.
- Yeah but that's not...
"Anyway, I did the Hail Mary thing, and it was great, I thought, and after the kiss, I was like, here we go, this is gonna happen."
- OK.
"- Yeah, OK, that's what I thought. ""OK."""
"Except she said, oh, kissing me was like kissing wait for it... her brother."
- Oh that's so gross.
- Right?
That's not what it's like kissing Jerry.
What?
He's a good kisser.
I'm just being honest.
But not as good as kissing me.
I forget.
Mm...
Still not sure...
You win.
I'm going to Dallas because I love you.
Do you love me?
"I can't believe I have to ask, but..."
"Yeah, I do."
I love you.
That was your first lie.

Then the blood will be on your hands.
"It was nice meeting you, Elena."
"Hey, Anna."
"Uh, where are you?"
What's up?
Uh...
Give me a call when you get this.
How is Anna?
I like that girl.
She has fire.
"Uh, I don't know."
- She won't return my calls.
- Girl trouble?
"No, no trouble."
"Anna just owes me a call, that's it."
Is that the girl that I saw you with at the Founder's Pageant?
"So you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?"
When was the last time you saw her?
- Why?
- To New Yorkers.
They don't live here.
"I'm all f or love, son."
"Come on, hero."
And that's an order.
Washington hasn't released a story.
What gives?
Drake's the story. I'm not.
You see Johnny here-
- Johnny?
Sergeant Drake!
Johnny!
I didn't like that salute.
There was something final about it.
I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.
"John Joseph Preston, eh?"
The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.
"Hello, Yale?"
Give me your top man there.
What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."
How would I know?
I just own taxis.
"Yeah, one of my men f ound a pin with a name on it, class of 1940."
I want his address so I can return it to him.
"Thanks, lovely."
"General, if you won't authorize me to go after him I'm af raid i'll have to go anyway."
"Yo, how long you two been married?"
Come on.
Play ball.
"Okay, all right, time-out."
Time-out.
My time.
"You, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"No, I've played once or twice."
Yeah?
"Yeah, I mean, I can see that."
"It looked like I was watching Lebron, and maybe he's just this much better."
You know what?
"Football was my sport, okay?"
Yeah?
Now you tell me that?
"Hey, you ready to quit?"
- No.
- Yes.
- Which one is it?
"Can you just give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him, all right?"
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away from him and put it in the hoop, huh?"
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
"All right, I can do that."
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge, here it is."
A couple weeks ago we're in rec watching some tube.
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.

3.

"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."

Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.

Me neither.
Wait.

Who?
Migs and Bela.
I'm not used to seeing them like that.
"Sis, be strong."
Fight for Migs.
"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.

-It's Ara.

WAITRESS:
"That's three scrambled and a cold Bud, whole wheat, sausages."
You boys are in for a treat now.
"Say, Fern, can you bring us some extra biscuits, too?"
"Sure thing, Hurricane."
"Some more coffee, too, please."
She call you Hurricane?
Folks call me that.
I never have figured out why.
I figure we can wait up in the woods.
"When the bad folks show up, we'll put the stopper in the bottle like that."
They'll be sorry they ever heard of Star City.
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...

Was wondering if you knew anything about Ken Mersey going missing.
"Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?"
"The considerable kind, I guess."
Ooh.
"Really taking yourself seriously in that uniform, ain't you?"
Don't mind going after an old drinking buddy like that?
"As far as I can see, he's under arrest."
If he's still alive.
How do you take your coffee?
I don't.
Well...
No sales being had.
No maintenance or repairs being had.
It's just a whole lot of nothing.
I haven't had a real need for Ken in the garage.
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.
He took them with.
He didn't say anything.
He just... went.
That don't sound like him.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
- It's Josh Peters!
You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and..."
Man!
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready!
Kali ma!
Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine.
Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so..."
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great."
I was in France.
"I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that, that wine was good."
I know that.
You're being discursive.
- What is discursive?
Discursive?
"- Robin, how could you?"
"No, she's right."
Maggie deserves some time to herself.
"Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, but that's when we discover who we really are and what we really want."

Hey.
"Maggie, sorry."
Class ran a little...

And it's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.
"God, we haven't seen each other since..."
- (LAUGHS) A long time.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
OLDER TED:
And then Maggie Wilks told us the second-greatest love story I've ever heard.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.
(MAGGIE LAUGHS)
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, of course."
OLDER TED:
"So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door to the guy next door."
"Well, see you next time."
"Look, what do you want?"
"Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you."
What the hell do you want?
"Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh?"
"That-that caputo guy, huh?"
Carmine caputo?
You're not gonna get away with it.
"Do me a favor, huh?"
Listen...
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years."
[Chuckling]
"Hey, hey punk, that's easy."
"Twenty, thirty thousand dollars..."
I'll give you anything you want.
"Just get me the hell down, ya hear?"
"Hey, hold it, hold it."
"Hold it, please."
Now where's your house?
"It's over in englewood, new Jersey... 26 ocean road."
How do I get in?
That's easy.
"I'll give ya key, huh?"
This one here is the front door.
The alarm system...
Be my guest.
Where's the safe?
"It's the first room, right behind the kitchen."
You can't miss it.
It's to the right.
What's the combination?
"No, wait a minute, okay."

- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.
"So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom right now."
What do I do?
"Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?"
But I'd take my time in there.
I'd let him sweat.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."

"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
"I was 20 bucks up, but with only enough time for one more pick-up before the bars closed,"
I needed to make sure I chose a wealthy client.
[ Cellphone rings ]
"""Honda Civic."""
I'll forward that to Rut.
"I wanted a bigger tip, so I held out for another car."
And I'm glad I did.
"Oh, my gosh!"
I don't even want to know that.
Woman #2:
It's crazy.
[ All talking at once ]
No!
"No, no, no."
I can't even begin to guess what they're talking about.
Yeah.
It's a package.
I'm just saying.
"Look, I don't wear toe socks around town."
I am out of my element.
He was weird because I went to his...
"While Rut was off driving a cheap Civic, my last pick-up took me to the Castro district, and I was looking for a big tipper."
Hi.

Tell me where you pawned Candace's ring please?
Oh the ring.
News flash.

"- Oh, my God, it's perfect!"
All right.
You're gonna give that diamond back
OK.
"As Matthew McConaughey would never say, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong."
Trent says no.
Trent smells so good.
"OK, OK."
I got this.
I got this.
Come on.
You heard the lady.
- The diamond belongs to Candace.
- What are you gonna do about it guv'ner?
"Well, I think that speaks for itself."
"Sorry, guys."
You're never getting this back.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go show my capitalism."
Capitalism's what I call my dong now.
"Hey, Trent."
You're on the main stage in five minutes.
Watch out.

"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
And... and you're right.
You're right.
It's not... it's... it's not just about you and me anymore.
And being a good mother means doing what's best for your child.
"And you may not understand this, and you may never... forgive me for it, but I..."
I walked out that door tonight to do what's best for Lucas.
This is what's best for Lucas.
You're what's best for Lucas.
This is me being a good mom.

"Boy, this usually only happens when I'm... when I'm around dogs."
(sneezes)
- You got a dog?
"-Uh, yes, I have, Ed."
- Maybe you'd better go.
-Huh?
"Oh, no, no, no."
I'm all right.
"It's just, uh, the..."
Whose dog is it?
It's mine.
I got it at the pound.
But please don't say anything to Ralph about it before I do.
He doesn't think we should have a dog in the apartment.
"Oh, no, no, no, I won't."
I won't.
I won't.
"I'd like to look at the dog, if you don't mind."
"Well, do you think you should, Ed?"
"Oh, I'm-I'm all right."
It's just... (begins to sneeze) ...just after the initial attack is over then I'm all right.
I want to look at the pooch.
Where is he?
"Hi, there, little poochy boy!"
"Oh, what a beautiful dog this is."
Hey!
Hey!
"Hey, Allie, my girl."
"Oh, how are you, sweetie?"
"Daddy, this is Luke."
"- Hi, Luke."
"- So nice to meet you, sir."
- I've heard a lot about you.
- You too.
And this is my sister.
I'm Lucy.
Hi.
Is anybody hungry?
Is anybody hungry?
"Luke, something wrong with your dinner?"
"No, no, no."
"No, everything's great."
I will guard the bathroom.
Just eat.
So the doors are off because...?
"Long story short, a few years ago, I locked Allie in her room and tried to strangle her with a nightgown."
I totally get it.
"Uh, my brothers and I used to fight all the time."
- It's not like your brothers.
- You don't know my brothers.
"Ha, ha."
"So your sister tried to kill you, why?"
The smoke detectors told me to.
Why they didn't just tell you to bake muffins is anybody's guess.
Did the smoke detectors talk to you?
"Yeah, mostly, back then."
Ahem.
"Luke, did Allie even tell you that she had a sister?"
"Yeah, yeah, but just that you were in law school."
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
"I was little, but I was so angry."
That doesn't sound like you.
I've got to cram for my lit exam.
PDA in the hallway.
It's adorable.
"Don't you have, like, everything to sign up for?"
First day.
You got a lot to do.
It is my first day.
I don't know where anything is.
- Okay?
"The cafeteria, the office..."
- I'll...
I'll show him around.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- He's a pain in the ass.
- I'm standing right here.
Just dump him at the office.
They'll take care of him.
"So, it must be weird starting at a new school in the middle of the year."
Used to it.
We move around a lot.
Living in one place your whole life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.
"So, yesterday, in the hall..."
Yeah.
Right.
I was wondering when you'd bring that up.
- You knew who I was?
- ‭Yeah.
And you chose to screw with me because...?
"It was more fun than ""Hey, I'm Eli."" ""Hey, I'm Emma."""
"- Rightthis way, ladies and gentlemen."
- [Audience Applauding]
"It's foryou, it's forme."
It's Studebakerfor 1963.
Amen.
Bless you for being here.
- There's a man that loves Studebakers.
- Can I getyour autograph?
- The ex-vice president...
"- Mr. Nixon, please run again!"
"Ofthe United States, Richard M. Nixon!"
"- [Audience Applauding, Cheering] - [Laughs]"
"You throw a hell of a party, Jack."
The party ain'teven started yet.
I've asked these gals outto the ranch for a little private thing.
"We're gonna have some fun, I guarantee ya."
And there's some fellas I'd really like you to meet.
Trini and I gotan early plane.
We're hoping to be back in New York for...
These guys are real interesting.
And quiettoo.
The girls are too.
It's notoften us Texans getan opportunity... to entertain the future president ofthe United States.
"Like you said, Jack, I'm justa New York lawyer."
- We'll see about that.
"- Mr. Nixon, are you gonna run again?"
- I don't know aboutthat.
- He will!
I guarantee it!
"- [CocktailJazz] - [Chattering, Laughing]"
Whoo-hoo!
[Giggling]
"Well, I could ask you the same question."
"Yeah, well, I'm here with the make-a-wish clowns."
We're visiting the children's ward.
Who are you with?
I'm freelancing.
"Can I speak to you outside for a moment, please?"
Sure.
"All right, man, can we stop this?"
We have hit rock bottom.
I'll admit it.
I have felt better about myself.
"Now, let's just put this competition aside."
"Come on, we're friends."
We can't do this to each other.
Aah!
The poodle you ordered.
"♪ She's lump, she's lump, she's lump ♪"
♪ she's in my head. ♪
"♪ She's lump, she's lump, she's... ♪"
- Dr. Lonsdale.
"- Hey, Sara, what's up?"
"Oh, not much."
Just prepping for my laparoscopic fetal kidney surgery.
"Hey, have you spoken to Riley recently?"
I have.
"This morning, actually."
She broke up with me.
What?
"Oh, God, that's awful!"
- I'm so sorry.
"- No, it's okay."
"I mean, the timing was obviously bad, with her moving to Egypt for two years."
-l'm sorry. I apologize.
-What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
"You don't buy anything, you hear me?"
You don't buy anything!
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
The fat fuck.
He oughtta wear a sign.
I can't believe this...
"Are you stupid, or what?"
Excuse me.
-Take it off.
-Why?
Take it off!
Take it off!
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big or attract attention?
"One guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $20,000 mink."
I'll return it.
Bring it back where you got it.
Get it out of here.
Understand?
Get it out of here!
"This drink here is better than sex, babe."
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody.
You look straight ahead or I'll fuckin' kill you.
"He's so jealous. lf l even look at anyone else, he'll kill me."
That's great.
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?
I've been looking all over for you.
"Listen, I need the money."
Um... do you live here?
My dad has me on the weekends.
He's been online dating and he brings his dates here.
"But, on the bright side, I get to hang out with ol' Beanbag here."
"Up top, Beanbag."
Boom!
Yep.
We see a lot of Rudy.
Okay... rules:
"One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose for the duration of the trip."
"Two, don't bother me."
"And three, uh..."
always believe in yourself.
Thanks.
We can't leave the Juice Caboose?
Are you kidding me?
!
"Get comfy, 'cause this room is your life for the next four hours."
But there's nothing to do!
Open this door!
I can't hear you!
"The train's too loud... honk, honk."
"Honk, honk?"
!
Trains don't make that noise!
"All right, this is gonna be great."
We have a babysitter and a lot of alcohol.
"Wait, don't do..."
"No, don't do it!"
It's a tasting.
"You're supposed to swirl it around and shake the glass to open it up, or something."
"Hey, open up, wine!"
"Dirk, stop right there."
[FIRE ROARS]
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
And I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"If Dad had let us stay just a little longer maybe I could have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It's tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth, I'm glad we got out of that town."
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
"Heh, how can you say that after what happened to you?"
[STUDENTS YELLING]
DEAN:
That kid's dead.
-Dean--
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!
-It's not a big deal.
-Not a big deal?
Look at yourself.
-If Dad was here--
-He's not.
I am.
And as soon as I'm finished with that dick--
"Just shut up, okay?"
-I don't need your help.
Maureen!
Maureen!
Them fish look like mama after she takes her arm vitamins.
"Maureen, get off the goddamn ice!"
You're gonna fall through!
You forgot your pussy!
No!
"Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
"It's okay, buddy, it's okay."
"Only your butt got wet, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"He almost drowned as a baby, you heartless whore!"
I did?
"Daddy, Billy kicked me in the eye a little."
Jesus Christ!
"- Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
- Frank?
"Sue, start the car, we're going to the hospital!"
You're grounded!
Out of my way!
My daughter's bleeding to death!
"Wait for me, Mommy!"
"All right, my daughter needs a doctor right away!"
"Listen, take a seat, fill this out and we'll get to you as soon as we can."
"Oh, no."
"No, no, no, no!"
I don't fill things out.
You fill things out.
She needs a doctor.
"Yeah, how about she waits like the rest of us?"
How about I take the brake off that thing and send you right out into the snow?
is there somebody else I can talk to ?
"[Continues, indistinct]"
Wench. I gotta stand over her... to make sure she puts your name on the damn list.
Triflin' bitch.
Okay.
Ooo-kay.
Yeah.
Da da da da da da da da.
- l'll get that.
- [ Baby Gurgling ]
Da da !
I know. I know.
I know. I know.
"So, your dad's trippin' about the flight."
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
"No, I explained about Nikki."
"So, you put it all on her."
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
"Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said."
Wait a minute.
You agree with her ?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
"Well, we like each other."
What is the big damn deal ?
"It's me and him, not us and other people."
"Black people, Sara."
Black women.
Derek's about something.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
Oh.
"Hi, Dad."
"Don't you 'hi, Dad' me, you little prick."
What did I say?
What's the one thing I told you to do?
Floss?
Keep your nut down!
I did!
"So why, for Sphinx's sakes, is there not one, but two protests going on outside that door?"
"The Professor did that, not me."
"Well, hang on..."
And why are you chucking apples at some geezer strapped to a column?
Aurelius.
"Great to meet you, sir."
Love the beard.
It's jugball.
It's...
"He invented it, it was all him."
"Finally, he admits it!"
I couldn't give a pharaoh's fat one.
I've only come here cos I've been contacted by the bloody Emporium.
"You've spent 15,420 dinaris, and mostly on caviar."
"That wasn't me, I promise."
Right.
"Tutankhamen, give me the bleeding card back."
I don't know where it is.
I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
"Oh, brilliant."
"Have you got my card, boy?"
"Mm, yeah."
"Give it back, then, fuck face."
"Every time I come here, Every time, you two."
Don't you work?
"Henry, nice to see you."
"Hi, how are you?"
"Anthony, right in the front."
"Anything you need Henry, just let me know."
"Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it."
You gave them $20 each.
"Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there."
-Where?
-Over there.
"Thanks a lot, Tony."
Salut!
-What do you do?
-What?
-What do you do?
-l'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen the Copacabana is proud to present the king of the one-liners Henny Youngman."
How are you all?
I'm glad to be here.
"Take my wife, please."
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
"I said, ""Where do you wanna go for your anniversary?"""
"She said, ""I wanna go somewhere I've never been before. """
"I said, ""Try the kitchen. """
Dr. Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him another six months.
I love this crowd.
Watch out!
Look out!
Mater?
Mater!
Mater!
"Hey, take it easy, Mater!"
Oof!
Yee-hee!
He's nuts.
No need to watch where I'm goin'.
Just need to know where I've been.
"Whoa, that was incredible!"
How'd you do that?
Rearview mirrors.
"We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want."
"Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race."
"What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?"
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.
"And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters."
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.
What's wrong with rusty old cars?
"Well, I don't mean you, Mater."
I mean other old cars.
You know?
- Not like you.
I like you.
"- It's OK, buddy."
"Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?"
- No idea.
Pass.
- Mark Twain.
What Irish river forms the border of Connacht with Leins?
- The Shannon.
"- That's pretty scary stuff, Suri."
- How's Daisy doing?
- She's good.
She's going to get out soon.
- Great.
I have something to show you.
- Where is this?
"- The Falconer's Arms, opposite..."
- The Green Dragon.
- The night Lau died.
- I'm guessing 5 minutes before he died.
- What?
- Keep watching.
Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau.
Come on - you have nothing here.
So I had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening - so what?
This is accessory to murder.
No.
"Harry, I need something here, Harry."
Old friend.
You've been lying all along about this.
I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau.
Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge.
Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau.
"A nice, neat love triangle - case closed."
"But that's not what's really happening here, is it, Kalim?"
So tell me who's pulling your strings?
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
Do you know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
He lives in the old boarding house.
By Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Oh.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
"Ha, ha."
It was a gift.
"And that is a cab, so..."
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
You're being ridiculous.
"And insecure and stupid, but that doesn't change the fact that Matt's in love with you and I'm the backup."
- You're not the backup.
"- Yes, I am."
"You heard what I said, keep playing."
"I told you I never wanted to see you in these parts again, Black Bart."
I'll have to blow you away.
[fires cap gun]
"I got you, fall down."
"Okay, you want to play?"
I'll play with you.
Come on out.
"Let's see if your gun's as loud as your mouth,"
Sheriff.
I'll pick where to make my stand.
[fires and giggles]
Hold it.
"Smile, cowboy."
"I got it, Harry."
[laughs]
"[Billy] Bang, bang, bang!"
Whoo-hoo.
"mom, you should of seen it."
This outlaw chased me all over and then he tried to shoot me.
But he shot the head right off this fake Indian.
- Were you scared?
- No.
"Hey, I told you you'd like it."
"Thanks for bringing me, Mom, it's excellent."
"Well, here you go, you guys."
"Uh, I'm gonna go upstairs for a while, I think."
"You have a good time, okay?"
"Uh, say, uh,"
I think we ought to talk.
"See, uh..."
I know this is real hard on you.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
Just list them for me.
That's all.
Let me get back to you.
We're missing the best part.
You know it by heart.
I saw you lip-synching.
"Well, lucky l do."
I couldn't hear all the words.
I don't know if it's my old ears or the subway underneath.
-Did you like the Billy Bigelow?
-He's good.
Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury-- l heard about that."
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't wanna hear about another one like this morning.
Your boy embarrassed me.
You'll have to live with it.
-Why?
-Because he's my boy.
There's oil...
"... underthatvacantlot ,Frank."
Jobs.
You don't need to politick me.
I run Kings County.
Jobs for people of this city.
"Not leases for Lenny, Murray and all your greedy pals."
Just because this kid thinks he can elect you President...
But please don't be sad.
It isn't your fault.
"Hey everyone at my funeral, you don't have to be sad."
Death is natural.
Just...feel a little bad.
I won't get to see Je's baby's face.
Kai
I won't get to play badminton with you anymore.
It was really fun that night.
Shit!
"In the end, I forgot to retouch the photo for mom."
Doc
I didn't get to tell you about the beach.
"Actually, I wanted to say sorry about the other day."
And...
"I wanted to talk to you again, even as just a friend."
Shit!
Actually I'm missing out on a lot.
So the doctor told you not to die.
Body.
I am sorry.
I surrender.
"But you won't forgive me, right?"
Goodbye everyone.
Is this the last thing I see in this life?
It isn't even beautiful.
Hello Peng.
Hey you.
Don't call me a douchebag.
But your job isn't finished.
Just a little more.
I asked Lisa to send one day late.
!
- Nope.
"There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though."
"Sir, we're in a big hurry."
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?
Man:
"Gentlemen, put your hands together for..."
Val the Dictorian!
"(electronica version of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" plays)"
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.
(sighs)
Credit where credit is due.
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?
Miss?
Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.
Here's the thing.
"The gown, everything..."
He actually left them here last night.
Manny:
I was having a tête-à-tête with Chyna.
She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
"See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends."
I'm in the middle of my act.
"Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction..."
I'm such a screw-up.
"Huh. ""Integrity."""
"It should say ""Perverted Schnapps Maniac."""
Last night was terrible.
You look good.
That's impossible at my age.
Even more now... that I'm dying.
Don't say that.
I'm dying!
"Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong!"
I don't want to!
I'm dying...
It's all because of your son.
It's a girl.
Don't you remember?
Why do you blame her?
He's a selfish person.
"When he was small, he was so quiet."
Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later.
He was really cute.
And very obedient.
You know already what happened when he grew up.
He turned out to be so ugly!
Now that we're married I can tell you...
He took away my house.
You said the house was for me.
But he came back and took it away.
So I told him I was leaving to die in other place.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I know what I'm saying!
Who's that?
She's a nun.
She takes care of you.
You're younger.
I'm a retired investor on a pension.
"I went to Israel to live there as a Jew, in the twilight of my life."
"Hey, Frankie!"
"Come on out, let's play some Hearts."
Frankie!
Is it true you're worth over 300 million dollars?
"I'm a retired investor, living on a pension."
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot.

Hey!
"Everybody, pay attention."
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.
"This is my stepbrother Tom, and that's his girl Theresa."
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.
Say hello to Carlo.
"He's good-looking, isn't he?"
Yes.
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.
Sit down.
Talk to each other.
"Hey, Mr. Einstein..."
-The cake.
"-Sally, get in here!"
-I was scared.
"As long as she's breathing, we've got fate up against the ropes."
There he is.
"All right, so the bike was stolen in Emeryville."
Head back towards the Bay Bridge.
Okay.
There's your man.
Go to the toll plaza.
- There!
- Yes!
"Okay, the wrist."
Can you max that image?
Can I max that image...
"What can you tell from a tattoo, or whatever that is?"
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.
Can you make that any clearer?
Not with the tools at hand.
"All right, send me a screen cap."
I'll send it to Jenny.
She'll work on it.
Go back to where he stole the bike...
Hollis and 38th.
He had to have put on the helmet somewhere.
"All right, so, here he is at 60th... 57th..."
That's weird.
Okay.
It's okay.
I'll get him at 48th.
Is the camera broken?
"No, they're different cameras."
Go back to 60th.
What?
Somebody's erasing this... right now.
I thought you just said you were here to see Livi.
- I did.
"- Oh, well in that case, go right through."
"Gee, thanks."
"Yeah, exsqueeze me."
"Livi is the biggest star on the planet, she doesn't just talk to anyone."
But I have something really important to give her.
I'll only be a minute.
You'll need to speak to Megan.
"Uh, uh..."
"Livi, how's my superstar?"
You look fabulous.
"Megan, you can't see me."
I...
"I don't need to, darling, you always look fabulous."
"Well, I don't right now, how's the new song coming along?"
"Oh, it's fantastic, a guaranteed hit."
"Great, I'll be at the studio in 10 minutes."
Can't wait to hear it.
"Um, yeah, me too."
Ciao.
"Wow, this new song sounds special."
It better be.
"Otherwise, we're in for it."
What'?
"Hello, I'm Megan, the studio manager."
Hi.
I'm Mia.
"I brought this demo for Livi to listen to, and I hope that..."
A demo?
"Don't worry, I'll deal with this."
Err...
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
"- Yeah, why do you care?"
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be... fun and sexy and...
ask really good questions.
Ask him why he first decided he wanted to save lives.
"Ooh, ask him what his best surgery ever was."
I know how to go on a date.
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?
It's a show lunch for the mommy.
She's freaking out.
That ponytail?
It's gonna blow.
"Derek tells me you--you, uh, grew up right here in Seattle."
Are your parents...
"Mm, dead."
Mer's mother died last year.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
And your father?
Oh.
"You know, I should go check on the patient who's the serial killer."
Who's here.
"Not killing people, so that's good."
- I should go.
- Yeah.
"Family isn't her favorite topic, okay?"
She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking...
It must be awful for you.
Treating a murderer.
Dad died a long time ago.
He didn't.
It was my idea.
I knew she needed a transplant.
"You can arrest me now, detective."
I'm ready to go.
"Detective Munch brought you here tonight, didn't he?"
He is in a lot of trouble.
He did it for me.
I would never say that in court.
Read my lips carefully.
John Munch never came to your apartment tonight.
He never brought you here.
"In fact, you don't even know where this place is."
You got it?
Yes.
Detective Stabler.
What are you doing here?
- Have you arrested Mr. McGovern?
- Yes.
What's gonna happen to him?
Have to hand him over to the FBI.
He'll probably go to prison.
For trying to save his son's life?
Because he bought that kidney.
He had no choice.
His son will die without it.
I know why he did it.
But...
There's nothing I can do.
"I gave you Dr. Swan's name, because I was afraid to die."
"If Kyle McGovern dies,"
I'll live with that the rest of my life.
I sleep just fine.
Ok.
And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So... get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"$10,000 even."
Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30,"
"44, 45 each."
3 pounds should be 48 each.
- Who's short?
- Ok.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
"I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you.
Jack off.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
- Eventually.
"But for now, we keep a low profile."
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
"So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?"
"Uh, it's not that bad."
Wait staff tips out pretty good.
They can't keep a bartender to save their lives but...
I actually put my mom up for the job.
"How's that been, having Kelly back?"
"You know, same old Kelly."
"She's trying, sort of."
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
"No, we've known each other our whole lives."
Whoo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.
"- Oh, my God."
I know.
- It's big Jen now.
Let's have another one.
How many is that?
Ha-ha-ha.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town.
Kick up our heels.
Really?
I don't know.
I think the truth kind of gets you in trouble.
You know what you should do?
Find your dad one of those nice women that we saw in town.
Nice women don't understand him.
I don't even understand him.
"He spends all of his time wading around in mud, cataloging plants."
Good night.
Use the can if you need anything.
Can?
Looks like a boob.
"Hello, V?"
V.
"V, this is Frank."
From the can.
This is V.
My dad thinks you look like Grace Kelly.
Good night.
"Good night, Frank."
"I'm telling you, she slept in the tree house last night."
You're so full of shit.
"Oh, my God-- a ""C."""
My dad is going to kill me.
"What's wrong with a ""C""?"
Her car broke down in front of my house.
She had to stay.
She's there right now.
"She's going to tell on us, I know."
She's not there.
I bet you a zillion billion dollars that you are full of shit.
You're on.
"I mean, she has to come back, right?"
I don't know.
My mom's... kind of a train wreck.
So's mine.
"Well, I mean, what about your dad?"
Can you call him?
Dad's in jail.
Armed robbery.
"Impressive, huh?"
"My dad, he's, like, a financial planner."
And I think he's in trouble.
I don't have any stock tips.
"He stopped going to the office and these guys keep showing up at the door like cops, but he won't answer."
"Look, I haven't told anybody about it."
I can keep a secret.
Hey!
"Where you at, girl?"
It's time for you to get your buzz on.
"Nolan's so faded, he can't even feel his feet."
There goes the left leg.
"I miss you, babe."
"You know, it's not a party without you."
"Oh, you're sweet."
What's the deal?
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Say hi to everyone.
Allright.
Love you.
"Love you, too."
Bye.
So how long you been with him?
"I don't know about you, but I'm starved."
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
[woman laughs]
Come on.
"Hey, what's the joke here?"
Are you hungry enough to eat a horse?
"Uh, you bet."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
"Well, we'll work on it."
"I'll tell you, Billy, the red chili's the best thing they have here."
When you eat it you feel like you're out on the range eating' off a chuck wagon.
"I want a hamburger, fries, and a Coke."
"Howdy, folks."
Hi.
- Having a good trip?
- Yep.
"I'm Hal, I'll be your waiter."
Yeah.
"And, uh, have you decided what you'd like?"
"Uh, not quite."
"Well, take your time."
We got nothing but time in the off-season.
Billy?
"Billy, bet I know what you'd like."
[coughs]
"You'd like a burger, French fries, and a Coke."
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
That's right.
- And I guess we'll have the chili?
- Yep.
He didn't say one way or the other.
Doc....
What about Jim;
"Where I'm concerned, I mean;"
Tell me.
"Honey, it's pretty hard to say."
He just never mentions your name one way or the other.
Thank you.
"All right, Mrs. Smith."
"Doc, they don't know me."
They're very young.
"It's been two years, Lutie."
You can't expect it.
"No, I don't expect it."
I only hoped.
"Do you remember, I said I'd bring a double present for both of you;"
"-Do you remember, Sarah Beth;"
-No.
"But you'd like to have a present, wouldn't you;"
-Yes.
-Then you wait.
You look at what I have in my bag.
Now you look in the bag.
-Saw her getting off the train.
-Went right over to Doc Reid's.
[CROWD laughing]
[singing bird playing ON TOY piano]
"You must leave at once, Brice."
Do you realize I've never even touched him before never been close enough to look into his eyes;
-He's a fine boy.
-You shouldn't have come here.
Brock.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
"You keep away from my husband, you hear me?"
Open the door!
Answer me!
"I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!"
Is this the superintendent?
"Yes, I want you to know sir, that you have a whore living in 2R!"
"Rossi, Janice Rossi."
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
"Wake up, Henry."
What are you doing?
"Karen, what are you, crazy?"
"Yeah, I""m crazy."
And I'm crazy enough to kill the both of you.
"Karen, take it easy."
Do you love her?
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
"No, you don't."
"Be careful, baby."
Don't.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him.
$12.000 is a pretty good price.
But I cannot be bought.
"I might be influenced, but never bought."
"Mr. O'Hara, please."
"Mr. O'Hara, this is Mrs. Ryan."
What is the latest quote on the Wentworth Drug?
I see.
Would you please transfer four thousand shares from Mr. Sabourin's account to mine?
He's right here.
He'll confirm it.
"O'Hara, it's alright to transfer the stock to Mrs. Ryan's account."
I'll be in the office later and consign all the papers then.
"Alright, goodbye."
Here.
Thank you.
Now we have a deal.
Right.
The stock is now up to ten.
What?
Now I've made roughly $20.000 since your offer.
"I outsmarted you, Mr. Sabourin."
"Well, I always admire anyone who can outsmart me."
Goodbye.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Dodds."
"Oh, Mr. Sabourin."
I have that transfer ready for you to sign.
Alright.
What's the latest quote on Wentworth Drug?
Fifteen.
As of now you have made a profit of $200.000.
That's not a bad day's work.
Where did you get that tip?
Now I plan to mary and settle down.
Good idea.
Have you seen any girl?
"- No, I haven't yet."
But I will.
I see.
You hide from me?
"Tell me, who is she?"
"Hey, there's nobody."
"Don't wory about me, big daddy."
Find a good girl for yourself and settle down.
I did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.
"Come on, you are good at it."
But I am no good.
I get a bit nervous.
- So what?
I'll speak for you.
"- First, speak for yourself."
"Sheetal, these flowers are rosy in colour like you."
But you are looking more red in your anger now.
"Yes, I'm Vijay here."
I was waiting for your call.
Really?
"So, you were sure I'd call you, were you?"
Of course. I have seen a lot of cases like this.
Tell me...
How are you?
May I ask you why you sent me these flowers?
Just to get a call from you.
And just why did you expect a call from me?
Just because I want to meet you.
I'M THE ONE WHO GETS YOU THERE.
- I WIN THESE THINGS.
"SO, WHY DON'T WE POOL OUR RESOURCES?"
"I'LL BRING IN MY BOYS, AND YOU AND JEANNIE BRING IN YOURS,"
AND WE'LL WORK TOGETHER AND GET
"THE RIGHT TEAM AROUND YOU, AND"
THERE'S JUST NO TELLING WHERE THIS STOPS.
YOU WITH ME?
ABSOLUTELY.
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY KEEP TALKING.
IT WAS VERY NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
"YOU SHOULD SEE MY FRIEND, CLIO."
"CARE FOR A NIGHTCAP, CONGRESSMAN?"
"WHAT, ARE YOU DRUNK?"
YOU'RE NOT DRUNK ENOUGH.
WOULD YOU COME TO BED?
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
WE WOULD BE SCRUTINIZED UNDER A MICROSCOPE.
"YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?"
WE HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE?
OF COURSE NOT.
BUT YOU KNOW THESE CAMPAIGNS GET PERSONAL.
"CERTAIN LEVEL OF BRUTALITY, EXPOSURE."
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT MOMENT
WHILE JAMES IS SO YOUNG.
"WELL, JAMES ISN'T LIKE HIS FRIENDS."
HE OBSESSES ABOUT PRESIDENTS
THE SAME WAY OTHER BOYS OBSESS ABOUT DINOSAURS.
"I MEAN, ISN'T THIS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED?"
WHAT?
I JUST NOTICED HOW ADORABLE YOU ARE IN MY SHIRT.
"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.
"If you want water, I will get you water."
"No problem, no problem."
I thought you were dead.
You must have switched baskets.
Are you hurt?
No.
"You have to get me out of here, quick."
They're gonna be back at any minute.
Cut me loose.
Quick.
They keep asking about you.
What you know.
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
The Ark's here?
"I'm coming with you, Jones."
Get me out of here!
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!
"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
!
"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
I'll be back to get you.
"Jones, what's the matter?"
That's it.
Who knows?
That's why I wanted to retire.
Sorry.
"No, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, Blair."
"Look, I shouldn't a..."
I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs.
I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house.
I should have put you first.
Hello friends!
Are we having fun yet?
"Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right."
"They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here."
I'm not leaving you.
"No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then."
We have to stay together.
Please.
Please.
"You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay?"
Swear to me.
"It's the only way, Blair."
"Blair, come on, you know it's the only way."
Okay.
Okay.
"I love you, okay."
Get ready to run and hide.
Oh Jesus!
Get back.
"Oh my God, Connor."
Ow.
Sorry.
"Come on, hurry."
"Go downstairs, go downstairs."
Who is it?
It's Mickey Mouse.
What does he want?
He's come to say good-bye.
What are you waiting for?
I'm a cop.
I don't shoot people in the back.
Another way we're the same.
"No, we're not the same!"
"I uphold the law, and you break it!"
Chang died because ofyou.
I swore I'd get you this time.
"I'm sorry, but I won't let you lock me up."
"Ifyou must take revenge foryour friend, shoot me now."
Don't force me to kill you!
- You'd really kill me?
- I won't let you go this time.
Go ahead.
You can't win all the time.
"Jeffrey, where are you?"
Where is he?
Right in front ofyou.
- Don't take him away.
-Jenny!
Jeffrey's promised me he'll never kill again.
Put that gun down.
"Jenny, put that gun down."
Not unless he leaves us alone.
"I beg you, please, let us go."
I'll never let you arrest him!
Did I kill him?
ls he dead?
You'll be fine.
"I'm not actually talking, am I?"
This is bad.
I'm just going to go call for a...
Just try not to move.
This is really bad.
If there's a Smokey or a mobile EMT unit with your ears on...
I got a seriously injured fellow here on Route 7.
"I got you, good buddy."
He's on the shoulder and...
Good.
Block him from oncoming traffic... with your truck.
Don't run him down.
I don't think the company would be too crazy about...
Just do it.
I'll call the Sheriff's Department...
"This is Deputy Frank Downes, Oxford County Sheriff's Department."
I have my ears on and am en route.
Copy.
"All right, so are we, Deputy Downes."
"Kingdom, this is Castleview 19."
Do you read?
"Five-by-five, 19."
We're going mobile.
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Sir, can you move your arms and legs?"
How's he looking?
The right pupil is fixed and dilated.
The left pupil...
I don't know.
"Say again, Ollie?"
"It is Ollie, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
Michelle.
She's awesome.
She's out in New York right now doing a play.
You two would totally hit it off.
She loves hot gay dudes.
Always trying to convert them.
"Hey, uh, you into the Lakers?"
What?
The basketball team?
My agent got me floor seats for tonight's game.
We could go if you want.
"- You know, grab a couple beers after."
"- Yeah, sure."
Cool.
Come on.
Let's go.
Lola!
"Lola, come on!"
She's a good girl.
What a waste.
You're going to one of the biggest games
- and I'm stuck at home.
- Stuck at home?
Every time I turn around you're racing to get out of here.
"Yeah, but I'm exhausted."
"You know, Julia woke me up at 5 AM."
Not in the mood for an erotic wake-up call?
Not at 5 AM.
The guy is messing with my head.
"In the gay column I have flirting, giving me shoes, Lola the pug."
"And in the straight column I have girlfriend, Lakers and use of the words ""dude"" and ""bro."""
Lookit.
Holy mackerel.
"It's gold, Claire."
More gold than I've ever seen in my whole life.
Oh!
"Oh, be careful!"
"Hey, if we panned this much in an afternoon... think what we'll get in a month."
"Gee, I wish I could stick around here a couple of days longer."
"You know, I been dreamin' of this moment all my life."
"I'm sorry, Shorty, but you got to file a claim."
"As long as the trails are open, some prospector is apt to discover this creek."
First to register gets discovery rights.
"You're the boss, boss."
"- When I get to Dawson, first thing I'm gonna do-"
- Don't.
- Don't what?
- Get drunk.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna catch up on my meals.
"I like coffee, and my stomach's been getting weaker every day."
"Well, so long, kid."
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- So long.
"Well, good-bye, Mrs. Blake."
"Good-bye, Shorty."
"Come on, dogs."
- Hey.!
"Hey, Shorty.!"
- What?
You forgot your meal ticket.
Oh!
"Oh, yeah."
You're the most beautiful person I've ever met.
Even with ridiculous red hair.
"- Candace, will you marry me?"
- Yes.
_
So you know how my mom calls us Jay-Z and and Beyoncé because
I've got the great moves and now that I'm engaged I can do this.
- You do the all the sick rap rhymes.
- All the time.
I love rhyme.
Is that a crime?
Every time I climb a
Mountain you make me cry.
But it doesn't matter because I pull off some lines and make you cry because I love you so much.
M'mm.
You're mine.
"Baby, sell the bar."
Let's take it on the road.
"Anyway, so now that we're engaged, she's calling us Jay-Z and Fiancé."
"- Not really that funny, is it?"
- No

Why do you have a child on your head?
"Good, he's still there."
"This is Will, Charlotte's kid."
Oh.
"Hey, big guy."
Yeah.
He doesn't really talk that much.
It's made bonding awesome.
"Ugh, poor Colleen."
"Yeah, we got to do something."
"- Hey, what if we had a girls' night?"
- (gasps)
"You know, like, to let her know we're still friends."
"Oh, yes, I have such a great idea for that."
"Wait, me, too."
Wouldn't it be cool if we had the same idea?
- Yeah.
"- Okay, let's say 'em at the same time."
- Ready?
- Okay.
"- Three, two, one."
Get wasted.
- YouTube dance tutorials.
We could do both of those things.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Or we could just do mine.
"All right, here, to girls' night."
HEATHER:
Girls' night.
- I need this so bad.
- Yeah.
I've been a wreck.

We are gonna dance the sad right out of you.

She's suffering from amnesia.
- Amnesia.
- Yes.
She didn't recognise me.
She doesn't remember anything.
I've got to go to California to see her.
She'll recognise me.
"- Oh, she won't know you."
"- I'm her mother, she will."
"No, listen to me."
"It was one of the worst moments of my life, one of the most painful."
"When I stood in front of her after all this time, she had no idea who I was."
Oh.
"Oh, God, she's-"
"She's ill, she's in trouble."
"She needs me, Blake."
"No, damn it, no."
We've got to follow doctor's orders on this.
She is in very fragile condition.
"Now, she's not to be pushed, not under any circumstances, is that clear?"
Not any.
All right.
I won't go.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
But we have another daughter who needs help.
"Now, Amanda's been going through a terrible time."
And I haven't been much good in helping her solve her problems.
"She needs your help, Alexis."
She needs you.
Mm.
"Everything is fine, Franz."
The bar clown next door wants you to sing for him  for his ridiculous event.
Toni wants me to sing?
You can sing?
Can she sing?
I just want to let you know that I've cancelled it.
But why?
I could just sing for him once.
I would gladly do it.
I don't want her to sing for Toni.
Toni is a slave driver.
"You said it yourself, Franz."
They work all night long.
She's not working for Toni.
"If you have to, you can sing for him once."
Sing him the Internationale.
He'd enjoy that.
What?
The international workers anthem!
There were workers here once.
Screw it.
"I'm sorry, Franz."
I'm singing.
I'm singing!
I don't want to go to Toni's.
I won't go in there.
I've never been in there and I never will.
Once again....
You've sold the doors and the door frames?
Why?
I mean what could you get for a door plus the frame.
"Excuse me, but I have no idea."
Like Kay.

Have a family.

"It's not easy to be a son, Fredo."
It's not easy.

Waiter!

Later in the evening we're all invited to the Presidential Palace to bring in the New Year.
"After it's over they'll take me home in a military car, alone."
For my protection.
"Before I reach my hotel, I'll be assassinated."
-Who?
-Roth.
"Tom, it's time."
"I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom."
"Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head so hard against those bars."
"That's all right, Tom."
This is Father J. P. Rank.
- How do you do?
"- Fine, Tom."
You?
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.
Got her about bucked out yet?
I think so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
"- I understand you're getting married, son."
"- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn."
"You take good care of her, now."
"Right there, Tom."
"Keep your nerve, Sam, because I'm going to keep mine."
All right.
"Tom, step back on the trap."
There.
"Sam, I've never seen... such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs in my life."
"- You wouldn't ever forget me, would you, Bobby?"
"- Diane, I love you."
"I want you to find a woman, a woman who disappeared 40 years ago."
She worked in a club on Hotel Street.

Don't you know?
I just woke up in my garage.
That's a great place to wake up.
Mr. Martinelli is a fine....
Remind me to put him to sleep sometime.
My head's splitting.

See if you've got your money.
Just a minute.
- Murder.
- What'd you say?
I said murder. I just sat up.
"- The money's all here, Rip."
- lt is?
Then I can't understand why he slugged us both.
"- What's your phone number, Dusty?"
- Surf 3181.
I'll call you back.
I've got company.
It was Louis.
His neck was broken.
My brain began to unscramble.
"Louis, Johnny's letter."
That was the joker.
Then Martinelli was tied to Johnny's death.
Mrs Andrews?
Hi.
Probably don't remember me.
I live next door to Bob.
My name's Gil Raymond.
"Just thought I'd pop by, see how you were."
Gil?
"Oh, Gil."
You picked up my spoon.
Excuse me?
In the garden.
You picked up my spoon.
Erm....
"Oh, so I did."
"Oh, God, listen, what a day that was."
She never wanted me there in that house in the first place.
"Oh, I'm sure that's not true."
You don't know her.
She's a nasty piece of work.
The way she used to treat me sometimes.
And the things she used to say.
And he was no better.
Wouldn't lift a finger for me unless he had to.
And then....
Then he started mucking about with prostitutes.
"He was a pervert and... she was a mean, spiteful bitch."
And I tell you now... they deserved each other.
"Oh, well, my gosh."
How about I pour you another cup of tea because....
What do you think?
This one looks like it's getting a bit...cold.
Darling.
- Hey!
- Get this lion off of me here.
- No!
No!
You stop it.
This is my fight.
Do you understand me?
I'm sick of men getting in my way.
This is my fight.
You hear me?
- You hear what I'm saying?
"- Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh?"
Okay.
"We'll see you next Friday, huh?"
"""Beauty Versus the Beast II."""
"Come on, Brianna."
Here we go.
- You're not ready for this fight.
"- Oh, I have an idea, Dad."
Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag?
I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.
"Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right?"
I'm trying to find my goddamn headband.
Is that okay?
Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there?
"Is that all right with you, Dad?"
Jesus!
Why didn't we get the orange one like I said?
This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged!
"Oh, good."
Are you happy now?
I just punched a hole in my wall!
"- All right, go ahead."
- Thank you-
- Horace... (Mary Ann gasps)
- I told you to cut your hair.
"- So, anyone have an opinion on this peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter?"
Looks like he's floating to the top of the sewer.
Could be our next president.
"- Well, anything to throw that fuckin' bum Ford out of there."
"- Okay, now, what's your problem with Ford?"
- Are you fucking kidding me?
"You know what he said, he--"
Here.
"I saved it, all right?"
"""Ford to City:"
"Drop Dead."""
Horace:
He's been saving that headline for a year now.
- Yeah.
Fuck this guy!
He can go fuck himself forever.
You know what?
I wish I had Squeaky Fromme right here and I could fucking teach her how to shoot a gun.
Jimmy:
Oh.
"- Fucking hippies, they send in a girl, you know?"
"I mean, she had a clear shot at Ford and she throws the bullet like a girl."
- Holy moly.
Pete.
"I understand you have a hate for the president, but it's pretty severe."
Jeez.
"- Oh, wait-"
- Wait a minute.
"You're a loyal citizen of Germany, and I can respect that."
Sometimes I just don't know when to stop doing my job.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
How are they?
Ollie and Billy.
Oliver was killed last year in action.
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...
William now...
He's missing in the Pacific.
I hope he will come back to you soon.
"I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him."
"But that's not the game, is it?"
"No, it isn't."
Thank you.
For your kindness.
It's the least I could do.
Maybe we can talk again.
Maybe.
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.
The Germans searched the Abbey last night.
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.
Varges?
"Yeah, we talked about it."
Might be a good place to recruit more locals for the POWs to train.
"Let's leave it to Adam, eh?"
"So, Adam, what's it to be?"
"A life of comfort and privilege, and all the pleasures that a young man could ever dream of... or hardship, desperation and hunger?"
I choose them.
"Er... you may need to be a little bit more specific, Adam."
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean you, George and Nina."
"I choose you, yeah."
- Ooh!
- Yes.
What did you say?
"Well, I don't want this."
"I mean, it's completely fucked up."
Look.
"Adam, for goodness' sake, drink the man's blood and have sex with me on the billiard table."
- You are embarrassing us.
"- Look, get off me, you munter."
- Adam!
"- And up yours, you no-neck gaylord."
Hm!
Don't you dare speak to your father like that.
Father?
He's not my father.
Right.
I've had enough of this.
Oh.
"Ah, these are not your people."
These animals!
"Yeah, tell it to someone who gives a shit."
"- OK, I think we've made our point."
"- Come on, come on."
"Oh, take him and his ingratitude."
- # I wished on them...
- #... but they were only satellites
# It's wrong to wish on space hardware
"# I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care"
# I don't want to change the world
# I'm not looking for a new England
# I'm just looking for another girl #
Thanks.
Come on.
Let's get home.
"No, Tommy."
- You smell gorgeous.
- I said no.
You know you love it.
A bit of the old Tommy magic.
"It doesn't work anymore, Tom."
Shit.
"Ooh, shit!"
Wait...
Why me?
- 'Cause you're different.
- OK.
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?"
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Oh, Father!"
I pray to thee!
"# I got a man, so blind I can't see"
# I'm his favourite toy Like a beach ball
# Bang it up and down Or throw it against the wall
"# ""Oh, Tallulah,"" he said ""You're so dramatic!"""
"# ""What's all that shakin' goin' on in your attic?""... #..."
So you and Finn don't have to keep living in sin.
Whatever.
"- You hear that, Finn?"
- What?
You're off the hook.
"Oh, he's just daydreaming about two paintings a day instead of one."
"Well, I don't know."
Just give a guy a second here.
I need to think.
"(WHIRRING, CLICKING)"
"Ah, I never get tired of that sound."
"(BULB POPS, WHIRRS)"
Finn.
"All right, come on, guys."
It's not like I want to do this.
"Okay, then let's not do it!"
"Uh, do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement?"
"We got to do what's in the photo, right, bro?"
How the hell did this happen?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fucking dare.
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.
"Say something, Finn."
We should destroy that machine.
What?
We can't do that.
I know.
It's too late.
It doesn't matter why we do this.
"Maybe if I was like that movie kid, Haley Joel Osment I could pay her that much."
"But if that meant being good at drama, forget it."
I was crap at drama.
'Cause I hated standing up in front of people.
"So, basically, I had to go to school."
"The sad fact is that, like any island dweller from time to time I had to visit the mainland."
This is Imogene.
You can hold her if you like.
That's...
"Well, okay."
Yeah.
Got her.
Lovely.
"Yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?"
I know.
Isn't she?
"To tell the truth, I'm being crap with her."
You better take her back.
She could've been yours if you got your act together.
"Just think of that, yeah."
"So, the place is looking really nice."
"Barney, Barney, Barney."
"Say hello to Will, Barney."
Here we go.
It's the Antichrist.
"Hello, Barney."
How are you?
-He's lovely.
-Yeah.
"And what about you, Will?"
Any desire for a family of your own yet?
I'd rather eat Barney's nappies.
I just had to.
"Now, I know all about everything."
"You know if you're found, you'll be in a terrible jam."
- I don't care.
"- Oh, sweet...."
- What are you doing away from the school?
- I'm out.
Thompson fired me.
- He what?
- That's nothing.
That's part of it.
You should know all he's done.
- Tell me.
- We had a terrible row over the food.
That's why he fired me.
The boys can't eat it.
It's worse now than ever.
They won't stand for anything more.
All they need is a spark and they're capable of anything.
"Defendant, you're charged with the murder of Johnny Stone."
He knew Johnny was sick and he put him in the cooler.
"And you knew it too, didn't you?"
"You dirty, squealing rat."
Yeah.
"And you, Thompson, you killed Skinny."
"No, no."
"No, I didn't, boys."
I didn't.
I didn't know he was so sick.
I never would have done it.
- I ain't gonna let you throw yourself--
- Mind your business.
"Lisa""s body fits perfectly next to my body when we sleep."
You hold her?
All night long.
"You never hold me like that, David."
Never.
"Right now, you""re old news."
"You""re the same face Pete""s woken up next to for 12 years."
"What""s wrong with my face?"
- Nothing.
"- Crow""s feet."
I had my eyes done when Jim went through his phase.
A little liposuction.
A little breast enlargement.
"You don""t want to pay less than $5,000, believe me, or you""ll look like it."
So I should mutilate my body to make my husband happy?
- No.
- Yes.
Women are stronger than men.
"You suck it up, Joan."
Do what you have to.
"You""re in a life-and-death fight for your family."
"You don""t have the luxury of pride."
This may come in handy.
Good luck.
"It""s the baton twirler."
"I can""t prove it yet, but your husband""s shacking up with the baton twirler."
"- It can""t be."
"She""s my friend."
"- I know, sweetie."
We met her and her husband.
- What is it?
- Danny and I... we met Shannon in Lamaze class.
I love the smell of progress in the morning.
"Come by and see me tonight, I'll have more good news for you."
This splotch of grime will soon be a gleaming suburb with strip malls on every corner.
We'll call it Frazierville or Bernietown.
"Sounds lovely, ma'am."
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Let's go.
"Come on, get up there."
"Get on your homework, okay."
"All right, group A, you guys are on dinner, group B, you're on..."
- My man.
- Out of here.
Bumpy ride on the short bus?
"What's up, buddy?"
You're on bathrooms.
Get out of here.
- Let's go!
"- Hey, what's up, man?"
You're on garbage.
Group B you're on dishes.
- Last one in the house does my laundry.
"- All right, let's go!"
- Halt!
"Tweaker, get back here!"
- Man.
"All right, empty your pockets and keep your hands where I can see them."
Empty your pockets.
"Sneak in more candy, you do dishes all month."
Clear?
Get out of here.
"Hup, two, three, four!"
"Hup, two, three, four!"
Freddie's got a brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.
- The Empire?
- Yes.
"Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy and the show is grand."
It's just where all the toffs go.
"- No, I don't think so, Marcia."
- Why not?
I just don't feel like it.
That's all.
"You ain't afraid to go, are you?"
Afraid?
- Why should I be afraid?
"- Oh, I don't know."
I just thought...
"Well, I ain't afraid of nobody."
"But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you?"
"- No, but..."
"- He ain't your lord and master, is he?"
I should say he ain't.
Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress?
Of course I have.
"What are you standing there for, then?"
Go and put it on.
All right.
What's that across your back?
What?
There's nothing.
Did he do that to you?
- Let me see.
You two disgust me.
Fuck me!
"Well, every cloud has a silver lining, even the cloud that is black and smokey, because it's an explosion with a dead male in the middle of it."
"Come on, O'Leary."
I know a place that's open all night long.
O'Leary's Bar.
Hey.
Teddy and Mick run it.
Come on.
"They're not related to me, are they?"
"Well, they won't admit it now!"
"Hey, look at this guy, remember him?"
Yeah.
Philip.
Phil.
"Ha-ha ha-ha, see you, Phil."
"Hey, Phil."
"Oh, we're not allowed to use this car now because you've been sacked."
We'll have to walk.
Come on.

Clara is right.
Mum's used to speak badly of you.
But I always defend you.
Don't do it.
It's useless.
-But it upsets me.
"If I'd say bad things about mom, would you defend her as well?"
I've never heard you dissing her.
Well I can do it.
Mom is so selfish.
She just wants everybody saying good things to her.
Everybody like that.
"Yeah, but maybe there's someone thinking different."
Clara demands everything and she's right.
Mom says you're a looser.
To whom?
I heard.
She said that so you'd listen to it.
-No.
But I'm sure she knew I was listening.
With whom were she talking to?
Could you guess?
I met a woman once...
-Aren't you interested in what mom said anymore?
"Once, I met a woman who told me to write down 7 numbers."
-And she told you each number slowly without failing.
And all the numbers were odds.
"Well then, with whom were she talking to?"
To Juan.
Juan?
Clara is dating Juan?
You're never aware of anything.
"Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs."
"Oh, come on, lady."
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Who's that?
Kicking it down the street
Causin' a stir.
Who's that?
I know that you're wondrin'
That's her
"That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her."
Who's got the kind of charisma that
The boys prefer.
Who's hot and you know that she knows it.
That's her.
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.
And there is butterfly.
Me oh my.
Who flaunts her feminine magic.
That's her That's me!
That's Pam!
The overly-confident morbidly obese woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
"Going again, please."
Thank you.

Yeah.
I took two bucks off him.
[Chuckles]
"- Well, it was just a little bet."
"- Now, he watched it, just didn't listen to it on the radio?"
"No, he watched it on TV all night."
"As a matter of fact, Jones made a great catch."
We had an argument about whether it was over the fence or not.
"Yeah, he saw it."
No doubt about that.

You're gonna have to be very patient with him in the beginning.

I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show."
And I don't know how you feel about that--
Lemme ask you a question.
Everybody at this table.
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
"Lemon, let's go."
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies?
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop."
No.

"No, he-"

"Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Goodness gracious!
You hooligans better watch out.

And God knows I've tried.
not really if you're not going to talk to me.
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.
You don't wanna talk about that.
Or the booze you're drinking.
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
The ones that aren't healing.
And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.

That was my favorite mug.

"Oh, my God."

"Oh, my God."

Oh.
Maudie.
"-Oh, Maudie, light of my life."
-You skunk.
"You're a beautiful woman, Maudie."
And even more beautiful when there's fire in your eyes.
"You put those cuff links in my bag, didn't you?"
Admit it.
-Say the word and I'll set you free.
-Never.
When as in silks my Maudie goes
-Don't try to sweet-talk me.
-Then methinks how sweetly flows
You tell these people I didn't take your cuff links and get me out of here.
-Then when I cast my eyes and see
"-Quit it, I hate that poem."
-That brave vibration each way free
"-Ezra, make him leave."
"Oh, no, this is beautiful."
"God, I can't bear it."
"Maudie, I've substituted your lovely name for Julia's."
I don't think Robert Herrick would have minded.
And... guess what?

I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."

I'll sit down here and have a long talk to myself.
I have to get to know Jim again.
Are you having fun yet?
"so the fuck are we but he's not through,"
We're gonna take 100 firecrackers and light him on...
FIRE!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
YES!
"Look, Marsh."
The missing space helmet.
Judy.
"What's going on here, anyway?"
"Well, that, Marsh, is a bit of a story."
"At any rate, this is Dr. Alison and Captain Stedman of the American consulate."
Sergeant McEvoy.
How do you do?
They've been out looking for Sally.
"Well, I certainly hope Judy hasn't caused you any trouble."
"Oh, no."
No trouble at all.
She merely convinced us that she was Sally the astro-chimp.
With this helmet on I can understand how you could've made that mistake.
"Yes, now we're right back where we started from."
Unless we can get Judy to help us to find Sally.
(CHATTERING)
"Gentlemen, I think I have a pretty good idea where Sally is."
You have nothing to worry about.
She's safe and in good hands.
Chin up.
That's a girl.
Fine.
And again.
And once more.
That's fine.
"Well, Sally is in splendid shape."
"Thank you, Miss Tracy."
Let me see the results of the tests.
Sure.
(PAULA):
All I did was follow Dad's instructions.
-lt is a question oftime.
-What are you talking about?
-And you?
-About this sniper.
-Have you swallowed some gas as well?
"- This was a gas canister, after all."
-Where is it?
- Overthere. lt has a hole in it.
I long for a drink right now!
Did the canister remain in place afterthe shot?
I'm not so stupid as to carry it here afterthe shot. I was underthe fire.
I ask you again.
Did it remain in place?
"Yes, itjustjumped up a little bit."
-Where is that place?
- On the road to the farm of Marek.
-Do you want me to showthe place to you?
"- No, I'll find it myself."
"-Listen, and why did you take me?"
- l did what?
-Why did you take me as a mate?
- l like your looks.
Do you?
"Listen, I can marryyou."
I need a woman like you who is serious and beautiful.
Eh?
Let's go.
We have no more business here fortoday.
You smell medicine.
It resembles some perfume.
Asya and I helped to bandage the wounded.
"You know, there are so manywounded people."
What's wrong?
Nothing uncle.
People live their lives...
I'm teaching my life to live that's all.
Long ago I gave you an advice.
Forgo rangefinder your enemy with a smile.
I think you didn't learn.
I did.
I learned.
I also learnt that if you want to move ahead... pull down your opponent's pants.
He'll bend over and I'll hop over him.
And I'll win.
That's it.
Come on let's talk work.
There's a contract.
Let's sit and talk.
- Yes.
- You won't learn.
Let's talk business.
The job is from Home Minister Pradhan... and he's an old customer.
And the contract's ACP Thakur.
This boy recently arrived in Delhi.
And he tried to disgrace Ayushman's sister.
They need outside help so I had to come to you.
Uncle.
Is your information right.
Why?
What's wrong?
The boy looks decent.
I can't believe.
Sometimes innocent looking people... are the most dangerous ones.
And the Big Boss has accepted the contract... and that's it.
Because I told you to.
You get up so early.
I have to stop that.
I really shouldn't walk around here like this.
I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.
- The one time I need tape.
- l put it in the wash.
There is tape.
It's in the drawer like always.
- l wanted to wear it.
"- We'll put it in the dryer, sweetie."
"- Oh, my God."
- [Lily] What?
They're pink.
Those were in the washer?
- Yeah. I put them in last night.
"- Oh, my God."
I don't think you're supposed to mix colors and khaki stuff.
Are you?
How do I make them not pink?
I don't think you can.
- Sorry.
"- l think they're cool, actually."
- You don't have to wear them.
- Why did you put them in?
I think Atlantor would appreciate seeing a different side of Rick.
The pinker side.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.
I hope not in those pants.
- Fade-away jump!
- Jess.
"- Yea, I mind."
Actually...
Do what you like.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take it out to the stairs.
"Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces."
Put them back on the fellas.
"Sounds good, Daze."
Come on sit down!
I wanna show you something.
You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often.
No uh!
Here.
Now what were you going to tell me?
"Yea, the secret."
You were going to tell me.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Why is she so mad at you?
"- She's your friend, you tell me."
- I'm not talking about Violet!
- She blames me for something.
- For what?
- Her mother's death.
"- Why, did you kill her?"
"No, no."
She died after she left me.
- Why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.
- Why didn't she love you?
"- I don't know, Daisy."
I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing.
"As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway."
Does it have anything to do with Detective Hallstrom?
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, OK?"
You don't like him because you...
What?
Wanted you for myself.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid of me.
You're ready for contacts... if you want them.
Or glasses.
They'll correct you to 20/50.
Do you think I saw the killer?
"Seeing isn't something that happens to you, Emma."
It's something you do.
I gave you the equipment.
It's up to you to control it.
"If you invent these visions, you can stop them."
Do you think I invented him?
Doesn't matter what I think.
What do you think?
I'll call you later.
I got to go.
"Oh, sergeant, hi."
It's Detective Hallstrom from Chicago.
I'm trying to find out if Margaret Tattersall... spent any time in a hospital recently?
A lot of time?
She got a new kidney.
"Hey, you just can't..."
That's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Where's John?
What's the problem?
What was wrong with the last one?
Nothing.
And the people who bought it quite liked it too.
Really?
Really.
"Oh, for God's sake."
"Yeah, it's down again."
I called Ike.
"You call, I come running!"
"Ooh, OK."
Up and running again.
"Let me guess, he turned it off and turned it back on again."
"(LAUGHS) No, he replaced the router."
Apparently it was shot.
He swears it wasn't an excuse to come and see you.
Uh-huh.
Although I do think it got him here a lot quicker.
Would it be alright if I use the space?
To paint?
Yeah.
Or to hide from Ike?
To paint.
Yeah.
You go for your life.
Maybe I'll put one of yours on the wall and see how you like that.
Maybe.
"You know that Ike is a really lovely guy, don't you?"
And he really has a thing for you which means he's not going away anytime soon.
That's his problem.
Yep.
"But you'll still have to deal with it, right?"
"It's great out here, eh?"
While i was on the trip you so graciously gave me
I found it again.
Only it's not in santorini anymore. it's in fiji.
At least he was last week.
You found my father?
Get in. let's go.
Why aren't you in europe?
I was in paris
But only to get your favorite macaroons
From pierre herm?
And germany?
To pick up your favorite falke stockings.
You know how i adore them.
What are you doing here then?
You were right.
I was a coward running away again.
But everywhere i went
You caught up with me.
So i had to come back.
I want to believe you...
But i can't.
You've hurt me too many times.
You can believe me this time.
That's it?
I love you too.
But can you say it twice?
No i'm serious. say it twice.
I love you.
I love you. mm.
There's three. four--i love you.
"'20 years ago, my good friend Douglas Adams spent a year tracking 'down endangered animals, together with the zoologist Mark Carwardine."
Really?
"Hey, it all worked out"
"- for the best, right?"
- Yep.
"- Good night, Mr. President."
- Good night.
¶ I just did a thing I said I won't do ¶

"What's going on, New York?"
"How y'all feel, baby?"
"Oh, man."
"Jay Pharoah taping his special in New York, bitch."
"I love New York, man."
Got everything here.
Everything!
You got foreigners.
Statue of Liberty.
Beautiful women.
Ebola.
"You might as well laugh, folks, 'cause we all gonna die in about a couple of months."
That Ebola shit is no joke.
I never thought that HIV could be the lesser.
I don't know I've got to go pick her up.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.
Can you cover for me?
With the phone sexing cyber spacing eighty year old couple?
Yes.
Please they're kind of scaring me.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah go."
Thank you.
"Three, two, one..."
"Oh, keys."
Thank you.
Hey.
What happened?
Becca what happened?
What's wrong?
What happened?
You have got to be kidding me.
I just don't understand.
I mean you got a boot six months ago how can someone get a boot on their car twice in less than a year?
Every Monday I have to get up and move my car before 9AM.
9AM...
And...
Sometimes I forget Ok?
On days like this it's really helpful to remember that Becca donates blood... rescues puppies and volunteers at the local soup kitchen.
How much?
Nine hundred and eighty dollars.
Nine hundred and eighty dollars?
Yes.
"It's Ok, you know what we'll get the money."
"Love is alive, you act like a newborn child."
Love is war
Broken and running wild.
But thank you very much.
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready.
Goodbye.
Don't thank us.
Your feet are cold.
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.
It's cold.
I'm cold.
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.
But I dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.
"I see you, Miss Marianne!"
I think I've unearthed a secret.
You are worse than my best pointer.
Is he a butcher.
Baker.
Candlestick maker?
I'll winkle it out of you.
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.
- Give us a clue.
Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.
He's a gentleman?
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"Oh, this is the man who saved you."
He's the one.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I want to talk with yuko.
Come on.
Let me show you the place.
It's been a difficult week.
Yeah.
"Campanela, taka, thank you Shelly."
And now our connect at the Mexican boarder has been killed.
Do you know who did it?
I think maybe his wife killed him.
"No, shit."
These things happen.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
"When I was in high school, I used to smuggle a little pot, you know."
Then I would cut him in on the action.
And he still works the boarder.
Sounds promising.
"And the best this is, he doesn't have a wife."
I like you Nick Davis.
I think fate brought you to me.
Well here's to fate.
And to family.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I've offended you?
"No, I was just thinking about something."
Tell me.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
"Now you're slipping, Cam."
"Cam, you owe another six bucks."
"No, no."
I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
"Oh, really?"
That's great.
"Well, we're not doing it that way."
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
"- I got it, all right?"
"- No, no."
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
"So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night, after 19 cups of coffee."
- Check it out.
- You are kidding.
- What is this?
- You're kidding!
This is good.
"Miles, this is good."
"Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here."
This is called destiny.
"You know, there is the..."
Watch out!
Statue of David coming through.
Good God.
Look at that body.
- Kevin?
- What do you got here?
"A gay guy, a woman and a black guy?"
What do you call your group?
"""Republican's nightmare?"""
Kevin.
Drug dealing Nemesis.
"I had to go and, I don't know, turn my life around."
"Oh, you ruined the thong song for me, too!"
You guys can look but unfortunately I'm the only one who's allowed to touch.
I'm joking.
There's an alley out back where anything goes.
Nobody's interested?
You guys can take the dollar bills back out.
- Where's Leslie?
- Leslie is at a strip club looking at hot naked men who are not you.
Why?
"Women are complicated, man."
"Oh, my."
There he is.
"There's my B.F.F., my big dog."
OK.
"Look, all right."
"I get it, all right?"
You're sad and you know that I'm moving out.
"But I want to you know I'm not moving out of here, all right?"
For God's sakes.
We're J-ball and D-tell.
"I'm his syndicate, 25 percent off the top."
-Does he know that?
"-No, Delman and I made a deal."
"Look, what the hairless wonder doesn't know can't hurt me."
-You wanna look at the carnage?
-Yeah.
"-No, I am not going out there again."
-You can watch it right here on TV.
What?
"Great, great."
Keep an eye on my investment without having to sit with the riffraff.
Ha. ha.
[CROWD CHEERING OVER TV]
"Been playing with the knobs, haven't you?"
Look.
"Look, there he is."
"Wow, they love him."
Crowd's going crazy.
ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]:
"Ladies and gentlemen, here we go."
"Introducing on my left, weighing in at 245 pounds from Vatican City, the Choirboy."
[CROWD BOOINGI
[H|
SS|
NGl
"Excuse me, they're booing a choirboy?"
They hate his guts.
He stabs guys with his candles.
"And his opponent in the opposite corner tonight, making his professional debut weighing in at an even 250 pounds, the Battling Bailiff."
[CROWD CHEERING]
"Boy. what a moment this is for Bull, huh?"
They love him.
But you want to know something?
- What?
- I think you're too young for me.
- That's the problem.
- I'm too young?
- You're too young for me.
- I'm not.
[Sobbing]
"[Ida] Claire, do you want to be alone?"
[Sobbing Continues]
"It's all right, Claire."
Just cry.
Perfectly all right.
"- Oh, God."
- I know.
I know.
"Claire, you know we all love you."
You know that.
And we want you to be well... and just think of all the wonderful times you had with Max.
Just think of those days.
You have known him a long time.
And now it was his time to leave.
[Ida] I'm getting fed up.
[Woman] What exactly is it that you're fed up with?
[Ida] I have to be with people.
I have to do something.
"See, I was a therapist."
And I had people on the table.
"And while I worked on them, they were telling me things."
And I learnt an awful lot from that job.
There are different peoples in the world.
That's for sure.
I've never seen either of these.
I'm so sorry.
You know I have no choice.
I have to order the release of the detainee.
"If you live, my daughter dies."
- We'll call Jenny.
- She'll stay on top of Haskell.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is your hand on my person?
"You, as a person of interest in this screwedup case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers."
Laura.
"Thank you, Jenny."
You'll follow him home?
You won't take your eyes off of him?
Cross my heart.
He's out.
"Down, girl."
Down.
I'm gonna sit by Mimi's bed in that hospital.
I'm not moving till she comes to and I.D.'s him.
Nico and a chick who should probably be committed... that's nothing new.
What's new is one who's worth the trouble.
Good luck at the hospital.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Welcome home, dirtbag."
"- Hello, officer."
- Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Is this Mimi's room?
"- She can't have visitors, ma'am."
- I'm a friend.
I'd like to be there when she wakes up.
Rose.
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
"- Rose, I'm sorry."
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this.
It's so stupid.
- I must sound so pathetic.
"- No, not at all."
"He asked if Claire was happy, and I lied."
- Isn't that awful?
- Nothing criminal.
- Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Are you feeling better now?
A little.
"- You know, Rose, it takes time."
"- Yeah, I know."
I want you to know that I really value our friendship.
It means a lot to me.
"I feel the same way, which is why tonight..."
"I better go home, I have to get dinner ready."
"I'll see you at 8:00, okay?"
Shall I bring anything for your mother?
"Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix."
Bye.
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It's one of her idiosyncrasies.
I came home late and threw this on.
God knows how I look.
- I hope you like it.
"- Oh, my God, Rose, it's art!"
It's not art.
An artist isn't only one who paints.
Are you feeling any better?
Moo.
-What have we got here?
-People v. Doris McKenzie.
Your Honor.
The Santini brothers are gonna take care of you.
They're gonna break every bone in your body.
Please. lady. would you quit hassling me?
You're gonna get plenty when the Santinis get revenge.
All right. settle down.
Is it warm in here or is it just me?
You're not alone.
Don't usually see something like that without a yoke attached to it. do you?
ICHUCKLESI
I kid. ask anybody.
What's the story.
Mr. Prosecutor?
The defendant.
Mrs. Doris McKenzie.
was arrested at Madison Square Garden when she stormed the ring and assau|ted--
The Klondike Butcher.
Klondike here was engaged in a professional wrestling match when Mrs. McKenzie hit him over the head with a chair.
-She almost killed him with that thing.
-It hurt like the dickens.
Jack Delman.
Your Honor.
Promoter.
And I think this crazy broad should be put away.
Look at how she scratched up his face.
-It hurt.
Jack.
-I know. baby.
The Jujyfruits?
"Yeah, the Jujyfruits."
"Okay, K-Man."
- Enjoy the book.
- Thank you.
"Listen, Jake where did you get those eyeglass frames?"
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know where?
"Yes, I do, but I don't want anyone else to have them."
"Well, that's peculiar."
"Oh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody."
Really?
Every day she comes in and reads.
Never talks to anybody.
"Oh, I spoke to Debby Biblow."
She said to say hi.
Really?
"Gary, I really have to say I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me."
"Well, frankly, you can't keep a secret."
"You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows."
"Well, I still think it was wrong."
I'm sorry.
All right?
I guess I was just thinking of myself.
Yes.
So I called the litterbug a pig.
Not you.
I like policemen.
I wanted to be a policeman.
"Yeah, so why didn't you?"
I'm scared of being shot.
"Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story."
Every cop in Pittsburgh thinks I'm a rat.
You're not a rat.
You told the truth.
Nick knows that.
"Yeah, we'll look where it's got me."
"It's tough, but you know what my dad used to say?"
"""Loyalty above all else, except honour."""
We're pursuing a murder suspect.
"'89 Ford, dark blue, RHX715."
We just crossed the 31st StreetBridge.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.
- So much for the policeman's ball.
Take Bigelow.
- Don't you have a date tonight?
- You're my date.
- What happened to that nurse?
- It just didn't work out.
"You've got to give these things a chance, Tommy."
That girl that works for Dutch is awful nice.
- Is there some meaning in all this?
- Grandkids.
What?
I'm not that grown up myself yet.
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.
Send an ambulance to the southbound tube.
We'll trap him at 2nd Ave.
Captain Hardy.
Get out of the car now with your hands up.
- Uncle Nick.
- Is this the policeman's ball?
I did not come empty
You want more money I'm prepared to sell everything
The contract should be complete
Fathermplease come inside.
I am a honest man
It's a sin to entetr a goon's house.
Babu ji you are in my heart
You are everywere babu ji
I'm just unlucky.
So little money
It's worth crores to your boss.
He looks like me Yes
We have to lie to big boss
Ayushman is a goon wearing the uniform.
What now boss?
Now we'll go to Delhi and make Ayushman's birthplace his place of death.
Now boss will fight because ...
"Ayushman, Ayushman, Ayushman, Ayushman."
Boss has received his money.
Yeah?
Guard Shiv.
I'll give you space.
This is the first time that my Dad's money is going to the right place.
Just let the job happen.
The neighbour's kids don't let me drink tea in peace.
Take this.
Shoot Bittu right here.
What did you do?
"It's empty, right?"
"Yes, empty... just one bullet."
"Stop, stop!"
What if somebody had gotten shot?
Don't know her.
You sure?
She worked there the same time you did.
Lots of girls worked the club.
They come.
They go.
Some stay only for couple of days.
"How come you looking for her anyways, somebody been gone that long?"
"A relative died, left her quite a bit of money."
"Here you are, Papa."
"If we want any money around here, I gotta catch the bus to go to work."
"Hey, maybe you can give my Kiki one ride."
Take the beer with you.
I'll call some of my friends from the old days.
"And you come back tonight, maybe I'll have something."
Fair enough.
Thanks.
"You get some rest, okay?"
Sure.
"Hey, stop fussing over me like I'm an old man."
"If I like, I can go swim all the way out there and back again."
"Well, you are an old man, but I love you anyway."
Aloha.
"Aloha, Papa."
[ Phone Ringing ]
Mueller.
"[ Man Speaking, Indistinct ]"
What'd you tell him?
"[ Man Continues, Indistinct ]"
Okay.
I'll tell her.
"[ Woman ] Oh, uh, don't worry about dinner."
That's what I'm counting on.
"Where do you want to go, hey?"
What do you want to see?
Rrr!
Argh!
Is that her?
The woman twice dead.
"She's rather pretty, isn't she?"
She's not possible.
"Right then, Clara Oswald."
Time to find out who you are.
This is so depressing.
I was almost married.
I was so close to being done.
"Living a life of no makeup, wearing flats, being on the bottom."
"Maybe I was wrong about marriage, it sounds awesome."
"Look, don't worry, Lil."
"I mean, it's normal to feel this way."
It's not normal to make us put on these dresses and sing Kanye West.
"But, you know what?"
Anything to help you get over Neal.
"Uh, uh, uh."
"I told you, no one is allowed to say ""the n word"""
in this apartment.
"Shouldn't no one say ""the n word,"" ever?"
Then we should probably stop singing Kanye West.
You know what?
I'm over it.
I'm not even thinking about it.
Someone pass me another Neal.
"Uh, I mean, a beer."
"I know, but I""m scared."
"L""m so scared."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You know what, baby, you might just get it all."
You just might get it all.
"I love you, Mama."
"I love you so much, Cassie."
"Let""s get you dressed."
"""And they cheered and they cheered more and more."
"""They""d never seen anything like it before."
"""""My goodness, my gracious,"" they shouted."
"""""My word!"
"Lt""s something brand-new."
"""""Lt""s an elephant bird."""
"""And it should be, it should be..."
"""it should be like that, because Horton was faithful."
"""He sat and he sat."
"""He meant what he said and he said what he meant."
"""And they sent him home happy..."""
"""One hundred percent."""
"So, the sun was shining, the earth was turning... and my daughter walked into the rest of her life with open arms."
And it finally hit me:
Maybe Cassie has it right.
Wouldn't it be something if my daughter has it right?
"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
"Bye-bye, darling."
Who are you?
Jesus.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
Those two have been my bedrock.
"Yeah, I'm sorry about Darla."
"How's she doing, uh..."
How's she doing in prison?
I think she's okay.
"You know, I learned something."
Sometimes you just have to let your kids... sit in their own mistakes.
Sometimes you can't fix 'em.
Yeah.
"Well, I should get back to the hotel."
"You know, I'm guest of the day."
"[Chuckling] Say, listen, we have a half a pitcher of sangria, it's still early."
"Come on, hang around a while."
Okay.
Let me pour you some.
- Oh.
- Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no, don't worry about it."
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
"No, I'm gonna show you something."
You're gonna love this.
- I'm such a klutz.
"- No, you're not a klutz."
"Stop it, you're not a klutz."
"That's what I've been sayin', I've been waiting to show this to somebody."
- [Spraying]
- Watch.
"This new Stain Master, it is amazing."
It is gonna revolutionize the carpet industry.
Ready?
No!
No way a bit of weed is worth two years!
Mr St. Clair--
"Please, take a seat."
And let me finish.
If you own up to what you did.
Take some responsibility for your actions...
What's that mean?
If he pleads guilty to all charges--
I'm not guilty of anything!
Sentencing will likely be 3-6 months.
And there's a possibility of a suspended sentence.
Best case scenerio.
Right-- That's great--
"Oh, shut it!"
Why do you keep doing these things?
"Mr St. Clair, think of your future."

Mrs Singh-- Just send me my kids.
"But, Marva, your kids are Canadian."
"You have no income, no home for them."
You know these conditions must be met before I can release them out of the country.
They're my kids!
"Marva, we have no choice!"
No!
- Can everybody just shut up?
!
- I hate it.
Sorry about that.
Anyway...
Hello.
Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
"What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
I need you to send a gift to mom for her birthday from the both of us.
"No, I did it last year."
"I know, and I need you to do it again."
"Look, I've got a conference call at 1:20."
"Then Luke's tutor comes to the house, 2:45 sales meeting, and I still got to get Alex to Judo."
And yet you somehow found time to bitch at me.
Wow!
You really can have it all.
Ugh.
"Honestly, just get her a stupid gift card, you big baby!"
You're back in second place with your favorite view.
Ugh.
Why does everything with him have be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.
Perfect.
"Okay, first you berate me on the phone, then you show up to my office and berate me in per..."
"Oh, w-what is this?"
I don't care for this.
"If you get up now, you will finish it in time."
You can work here.
I brought your computer.
There's WiFi too.
This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag.
But this is about finishing work and being responsible.
Just a little bit more.
Only 2 photos.
"If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want."
"And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together."
Ok?
So what did you say to him?
I told him I want to sleep.
Damn.
Was Peng angry?
He wasn't.
Just told me to fuck off and change careers.
Don't worry.
I will find you some jobs.
Will you do one thing for me?
Don't do anything stupid like this again.
I'm asking you as your best friend.
Alright.
Je.
You have to have a baby.
What?
I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face.
So you are free today?
Yeah.
I came to take care of you.
I have so much to do.
Number 116.
So you've got a bodyguard.
But it can't be you.
"Yes, it's me."
"That seems funny, doesn't it... you and the 12 temptations?"
Sure.
I laughed my head off.
"Well, here i am."
"Well, now, that's just fine."
Let me see.
You can... you can go to the photograph gallery with me.
What?
I have an appointment there at 4:00.
That... that's-that's- that's-just a minute.
One second.
Just a little more light.
"Ah, that's fine."
"Oh, the hands... just put the hands out over on that."
Just relax a little bit.
Give me a little smile.
That's right.
"Hold it just like that, and i'll take one more look."
Oh... i've got it.
"Oh, that is beautiful!"
"Oh, that's so exquisite!"
Ain't you think she looks just like a...
like a... ain't you think so?
Maybe you can see something through that thing that i can't see.
"Well, go ahead."
"Look, look!"
"Oh, so soft... hey, you can't take this."
It's upside down.
"Oh, no."
We have a vision.
Ugh...
"Hey, come on, don't go!"
"Natasha, come on."
- Officer Scott.
- Doc.
So...
Lanagan Pike had a retropharyngeal hematoma.
"Blood pooled in his neck, most likely as a result of the fall."
OK.
So we need to keep him here for a few days.
"- So to be clear, I didn't strangle him."
- No.
"Well that's good, that's real good, 'cause I was worried I got carried away."
I was out of line.
- I apologize.
- Thanks.
Means a lot.
- Mr. Pike's intentions were...
- Intentions?
I don't give a rat's ass about Lanagan Pike's intentions.
He didn't break a window.
A police officer's dead.
I'm not saying he's not responsible
- for his actions...
"- Hey, hey next time an ER doc dies in the line of duty, give me a call."
"Pretty, pretty blanca, as ordered."
"That's great man, that's really great."
"Look man, I kinda ran into a little bit of trouble tonight."
Oh yeah?
That's too bad.
- I don't have any money.
One more time.
"Okay, on this part ?"
"It's like we're battling, right ?"
It's like a challenge.
"When I step forward like this, you have to challenge me back into my space, and I challenge you back in your space, like this."
"So, it's back, front, back, front, back, front, like that, that kinda feel."
"Step, back, forth, back."
"Wait, wait."
You're making me dizzy.
"Stop, stop."
"Sit on it, sit on it."
Stick your ass out.
- Do it.
- [ Both Laugh ]
"Okay, okay."
How am I doing ?
How's my butt ?
"[ Chuckles ] lt's nice. I mean, it's good."
Thank you.
[Sara] You made that ?
It's really nice.
It's Tanisha's.
That girl's gonna pay my way through design school.
What about your mom ?
Where is she ?
She was in jail...
for drugs.
For things women do for drugs.
She got out and took off.
"Well, maybe she'll come back."
"That is what Derek used to say when we were little, when Momma Dean used to piss us off."
But he grew up.
"Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place I made as if I didn't care."
I did care.
"After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back."
"Truly, I did."
"This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again."
I give you my word.
How do you know?
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!
No.
He won't come back.
I'll see to it.
"Oh, you don't know him, sir."
"Oh, you don't know him."
"He ain't human, he ain't!"
I gave you my word.
You'll never see Hyde again.
You must believe me.
"I believe you, sir."
I believe you.
You must go now.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"For a moment, I thought..."
Goodbye.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person."
I didn't know she was hysterical.
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.
"Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss."
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.
"Legs, up to here!"
I'll think about it.
"Good, don't take so long!"
I've got to drink something.
Why are you coming here?
I walk around the whole day  and think about how I could live.
I come back here and wait...
"Mainly, I've been waiting on you, my dear."
You've really downsized quite a bit.
My father started all that.
I've told someone about you.
Could you imagine living here with us?
He'd like to take a look at the hotel.
Why?
He could do a lot more for you.
Why are you coming here?
You leave everything open.
"Very nice, without any obligations."
We have the ability to speak.
What is it that you do all day?
What do I do?
But you're still staying?
I'm still staying.
It's so silent here.
No singing.
Where is Emilia?
She's taking a walk.
What?
It's one in the morning.
I have no idea.
Perhaps she's singing outside now.
What do you do before you come here?
- It's gonna take some work.
"- I appreciate that, Lucy."
Don't say I never did anything foryou.
I neverwould.
Did she say anything before--
She wished that things had turned out differently.
Tell me about Doug and Jasper.
On theirway to a new life in an undisclosed location.
He's gonna have to come back for trial.
[ Sighs ] Wanted you to have that.
Andl have anotherpresent foryou.
It's your new identity.
- It shouldgetyou to D.C. orwherever.
- [ Sighs ]
"Thankyou, Lucy."
It's the least I could do.
What about your car?
"Whatever it costs, I want to reimburse you."
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna be in Miami that much longer.
- I'll seeyou again?
- Maybe.
- Lucy.
- Sam.
"So, is thatyour new I.D.?"
Yep.
I could get into the White House pressroom with these documents.
- I don't thinkyou're gonna need it.
- Why is that?
Just got a call from a buddy... one ofthe guys I asked to keep an eye out on this burn notice business.
- You might want to rethinkyour trip to D.C.
- Why?
You were the one that taught me that.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you really doing here?
You caused quite a stir.
"You blew into town, saw everyone except for the man who made you."
- I'm a little hurt.
- I'm so sorry.
Did you bring the device?
[CHUCKLES]
- Ow.
"- Heh, heh."
- What are you doing with John Gilbert?
- We dated when we were young.
- He was a little bit in love with me.
"- I'm sure, one of the many."
"Now, this invention, what do you want with it?"
"Oh, me personally?"
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
"You know, Damon, we're on the same side."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Which side is that?
- Katherine's.
She wants John Gilbert to have the device.
I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.
- Why are you doing her dirty work?
- Don't kill the messenger.
We both know that you can't control Katherine.
- She does what she wants.
- Pfft.
And so do I.
"- Oh, really, Damon?"
I never should have let him stay.
I should have dragged him into that bus.
It's not your fault.
All that talk about death's sweet embrace.
You know what?
It's not sweet.
It hurts.
Did Gene have any allergies?
I can ask his mother.
Absinthe and wine are the only things Lexia drinks so it's all we serve.
"I've got to say I could go for a tequila every now and then, you know?"
"And Gene Hansen, what was he drinking the night he died?"
Absinthe.
Anything else?
Not that I know of.
Drugs?
In a nightclub?
Half the kids here are using.
Did Lexia know that?
She'd have to be blind not to.
"Yeah, she sure would."
Now this is truly a surprise.
"I need your help, detective."
I don't do parking tickets.
It's not about parking tickets.
Really?
"Well, you must want to know what to get Vicki for her birthday."
You know what?
"Between you and me, she really loves kitten posters."
This was a mistake.
"Hey, hey, Fitzroy, come on."
"Hey, come on."
"- Don't answer it, Stokes!"
- May I enquire why not?
"They're wearing dinner jackets, we've got to change."
"- Come on, James."
"- Very good, sir."
Answer the door and attend to them.
We'll be right down.
"Yes, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Oh, er, good evening."
"We're a bit early, I'm afraid."
"Oh, that's all right."
Come in.
(Door closes)
I'll take your hats and coats.
Nice weather we've been having.
I was saying to my wife this morning what nice weather we've been having.
- It rained last Thursday.
"-Yes, but apart from that."
- It didn't rain very much.
- No.
Came through my roof.
Nearly had the ceiling down.
I'm sure his lordship's maid doesn't want to hear our domestic problems.
"I don't mind, I'm very sympathetic."
"This way, please, and I'll announce you."
Just look at this place.
All got through the sweat of our labours.
"Don't start, Jock."
We've only just got through the door.
- Mr Foster.
"- (Cissy) Good evening, Mr Foster."
- Mr Barnes.
To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered.
I found him.
His name is Pham Son Ti.
And I will give him to you.
When?
"One week from tonight, at the old Costeau Plantation."
Colonel Cai knows where it is.
How much do you know about this girl?
Her father and General Ti's father grew up together.
Their families were very close.
Even before he moved to Hanoi he had more than a friendly interest in Lin.
Do you trust her?
Of course.
She's my brother's wife.
"Let's see, it's 0400."
That means we'll hit the drop zone around a little after sunrise.
Everything set?
Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's.
KIRBY:
Thank you.
Let's get aboard.
MULDOON:
You heard the man.
Stick formation.
Let's go.
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.
"Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night."
You know why?
He's never jumped before.
First one's easy.
It's the second one that's hard to get them to make.
"- No, you're right, and I don't."
"That doesn't mean I feel that way now, though."
"No, now you feel guilty."
You're still scared.
You're just scared of what I'll do to you.
"Well, that's true."
- You were really terrified?
"- Jenna, I am terrified."
"So am I, you idiot."
"I'm scared I'm gonna be a bad mother, and you won't love me, and you'll ignore me, and..."
"I won't want you, and the whole thing will fall apart and I won't know what to do."
"- Baby, that's not gonna happen."
- How do you know?
Because I know.
"- You know now, you didn't know before?"
- Yes.
I know now.
Were you telling me the truth last night?
You didn't sleep with her?
I was telling you the truth.
But then I went back.
Fuck you!
Jenna.
Calm down!
Listen to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
- Get the fuck out!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
It never occurred to me to get married.
You know I've never been in love in my life?
Is something wrong with me?
There must have been something wrong with your husband.
"Oh, he was alright."
I just didn't love him.
Love is a very unsatisfactory thing anyway.
Life is a regular battle.
There.
Chuck!
Chuck!
What's the matter?
"Chuck, he stole my money."
"Wait, I'll get him."
Chuck!
"Alright, get back."
Back on the curb.
"Watch out, let me through!"
Get out of my way!
Chuck!
Chuck!
"Oh, no..."
The man suddenly darted out in front of the truck.
I couldn't miss him.
Is he dead?
"Yes, well, I'm due at the hospital in the next thirty minutes."
"Yes, I've tried the drug out."
It's nothing short of miraculous.
You know they're going to announce it at the Medical Convention in Atlantic City.
"Oh, by the way, what's the stock selling at?"
Two dollars?
I think I'll have my broker tomorrow morning buy me about three hundred shares.
Sounds like a great idea to me.
"Spencer, let's go."
I've done my part.
"As much as she hates to admit it,"
"The magazine really needs you, regina."
- oh.
"- Oh come on, spencer, please."
I am not gonna keep apologizing
- To someone who wants to keep an attitude with me.
- Okay.
- Let's go sit down.
- Thank you.
"Oh, i'm sorry."
There's nothing to sit on.
- Georgia: yes.
- Please consider it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Oh god, what a mess."
"Now what are you gonna do, gina?"
"I'm gonna think about it, mama."
That's what i'm gonna do.
She's not thinking about getting me back.
She's just trying to impress spencer.
She doesn't want me working with her.
"Oh, what do you care about whether she cares or not?"
She's offering your job back
And you haven't worked in six months.
We're in trouble here.
Where are you going?
I gotta go take a walk.
I gotta go clear my head.
Cash or charge?
- Cash.
- [Woman] Cash is $54.
- Right.
Okay.
Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice flight.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Round trip to Washington, please."
[Car Door Closes]
So?
"So everything's going great, terrific, beautiful."
I'll need a few more days though.
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while... just to make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City... without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm leveling with you."
I need a little more time.
It's just that my people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch.
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.
"Look, Charnier."
You got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem too."
It's so nice to have seen you again.
[Speaking French]
[French]
"I'm taking this, okay?"
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
"Ma, it's a sin to leave it there."
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
"I get a nice one almost every night, Ma."
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I settle down almost every night.
But then in the morning I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Why don't you settle down?
"How's your friend, Henry?"
What's the matter?
You don't talk too much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
"You don't eat much, you don't talk much."
-l'm just listening.
"-What's the matter, something wrong with you?"
"When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other."
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
That was amazing.
You think?
Yeah.
You know everyone right?
Yeah definitely lovely ladies of LA of course and Seven how are you?
Much better now that you're here how are you?
Good.
Hey...
How are you doing?
Ah I'm gonna go to the bar.
Anybody want a drink?
You guys want to join?
I'll stay.
So can you get me another Jack and Coke?
Yeah sure.
Ok.
Hey...
Hey where did Dale go?
Oh she went to the bar.
Oh well Cece this is Hallie.
- Hey.
I didn't get a chance to introduce you guys the other night.
"No you never did, nice to meet you."
Same.
Oh this is my girlfriend Dominique.
So um when are you practicing tomorrow I want to hear the new song.
Cece works in AR for our tour manager.
So everything's got the thumbs up from her.
I'm easy.
I mean not that kind of easy you know.
But with a voice like his you can't do much wrong.
"She's cute, I say go for it."
Any place that has this turf needs to be closed and searched.
"Yes, mom."
We're all over it.
Watch your step out there.
"Yeah, you too, Tanner."
Hauser was so sure of himself.
He was even more of a jerk than usual.
You gonna rub it in?
Tell me that you're still at the park.
"Oh, yeah, I am, but Petty's not."
Stay there.
He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me, do not move."
Petty.
You know me?
A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.
It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well, transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
Shh.
Drop the knife.
"Get on the ground, face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
- I don't know Daze.
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
- Do you know why we're here?
"- Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there's must be some sort of misunderstanding.
We're not here to clean your bathtub up.
Organize your closet or make you happy.
Really?
Yeah.
We're here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I have a word with my partner?
Wait a sec.
"Search him, Daze."
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
"- This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi."
"- Yeah, I know."
I just wish it more like a normal job.
Now it's weird.
I never really talked to a job before.
This might be some kind of test.
"Everything's a test, when you're a career woman."
Damn right.
And those dresses aren't gonna buy themselves.
- I got it!
- What?
- I know we could do!
- What?
Why don't we just go in there?
Blasting without thinking about it.
I could give it up for the right guy.
"Oh, that came out wrong."
What I mean is...
"I would, you know, stop hooking if you wanted me to."
"I mean, there is lots of pans with pancakes out there, right?"
I think I'd like that.
Mr. Reznik.
"I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else."
You gave me such a scare.
What are you doing in my apartment?
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.
That's impossible.
I was going to leave a note.
A note?
What kind of note?
About the leak.
What's that terrible smell?
There's no leak in this apartment.
Now if you will excuse me...
"- You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?"
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
"If you need anything, please call first."
Miller.
Miller!
"Hey, Reznik."
It's a pleasant surprise.
We need to talk.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
"Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line."
"Hey, let's not trim anything for a while."
I need to be doing something.
"The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both."
"Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale, but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99."
"The shoes were just marked down from $155, so you're looking at $1,042.68."
I'm pretty good with numbers.
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
"Yeah, so let me know when I can ring that up for you guys."
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
- Could you help me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Yeah, sure."
I'm looking for a tie.
"Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale on the ties."
"And if you want, I could probably get you an additional 10% with my employee discount."
- This one's nice.
- Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
"This one has actually been treated with our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection, you know, to repel liquids and stains."
"- Well, that's really functional."
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's pretty functional."
Face me.
Stay still.
"Despite being tempted by the Nano-Tex repellant,"
"I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben."
I came to see you.
You did?
Thank you for calling.
Lieutenant Barnhill received his posting.
He leaves in a few days.
"He was the airman who took your daughter to the movies, right?"
"Gosh, yes."
How did you know?
I figured.
The fight.
I thought there might be a connection.
"Perhaps retribution by the men of the parish, so I asked him."
Men?
Four to one.
He asked me to give you this to pass on to Emma if you felt it was...
Appropriate.
I have read it.
"I find I am camp censor, for my sins."
"It is a simple, rather sweet goodbye."
- I don't want to.
- Read it?
Read it or give it.
What if he is killed in action?
She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.
"You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her."
It would cast a shadow over her life.
I understand.
Mrs. Coyne.
You knew.
What?
What was being planned.
I didn't.
I swear.
Barney did.
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
There we go.
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
"Um, but... it's better if I show you at the lab..."
Hello?
"Oh, spasiba."
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
Amy is a really nice girl and so are you.
I told her all about you.
"If you told her all about me,"
I doubt she'd want to meet me.
"No, she does, she does, promise."
All right.
What time?
She's usually home by seven.
Are you sure about this?
I don't feel like I can hang out in the coffee shop unless Amy's comfortable with our being friends.
She's my wife.
All right.
"But if it gets boring, I'm leaving."
It's not going to be boring.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Oh?
Why didn't you say so?
See you at seven.
You want another cup of coffee?
I'll get the waitress.
"Oh, I don't know."
I kind of like those scones.
I got it!
"So, you're not dating anyone?"
Kind of.
But you know what they say about relationships.
"""Sooner or later, they're all over."""
Even your relationship with Ricky.
And yours.
"Hey, Clementine,"
"Adrian needs another cup of coffee, do you mind?"
"No, I don't mind."
"- Yes, please."
"Er, forgive me. it's been a long time since I've seen anything like that."
"Oh, I wear this to hide it."
"It's so ugly, you know."
- And may I ask which camp?
"- Jadwiga, Poland."
It was long ago.
I am sorry.
Don't be sorry for me.
"Because Saul and I, we survived."
But it never ends.
Now they got Saul again.
"Now, Lena, we'll get him."
Don't worry.
When are your people coming in?
I'm not sure.
"Tonight, tomorrow."
They don't give you a schedule.
But they will try to contact us at my house.
Rick's working on that.
Calls to your number will be switched here.
- How does he do that?
"- Illegally, I'll wager."
He has connections.
"Tommy, you still have to take me to my home."
"Lena, we have been all through that."
I don't have any clothes.
"Nothing, not even a toothbrush."
- I'll get whatever you need.
- You don't know what to get.
I'll bring a little bit of everything.
"Tommy, my personal stuff."
"Odds are, that's what got him killed."
"Look, I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl, but we don't have a client."
And impressing that ridiculous detective society isn't exactly on the top of my list.
"Well, it's on mine."
"But first, let's see if anyone knows what I was doing here a year and a half ago."
Yeah.
This is definitely the place.
Andrew:
Two for lunch?
[Shouting in Korean]
The watch.
Richard.
What's going on?
You were here 18 months ago.
"Uh, yeah."
It's my place.
So?
Do you recognize him?
"No, should I?"
"Uh, I was here about, um..."
[Speaks Korean]
I was here about a year and a half ago.
Something happened.
You yelled at me.
"Oh, you're the guy with the watch."
What watch?
You...
You couldn't pay.
And then I was gonna call the cops on you.
"And then, uh, you..."
you gave me your watch to hold onto.
"Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came."
"He doesn""t have anything to say."
"You, sir, do you have anything to say on your brother""s desire to speak to me?"
- You did it!
- No!
"See, with cheating comes lying."
And lying and lying some more.
Every single lie out of your mouth does a little more damage to you.
Lunch.
"Until one day you wake up, and you don't know who you are anymore."
"Listen, I made dinner plans tonight... with Lisa."
"It""s no big deal."
"We""re just gonna go to Perry""s."
I have to set some things right with her.
"""Make amends,"" like Pastor Paul said."
"It""s only dinner, Clara."
I promise.
"You understand, don""t you?"
Yes.
I love you.
What?
I think my husband is cheating on me.
"L""m sorry to hear that, honey."
With our receptionist.
Ex-receptionist.
Lisa.
"What was her real name, Amy?"
Rebecca Singer.
"- He""s taking her out to dinner tonight."
"- Perry""s Steakhouse."
Yeah.
"Perry""s cuts their pork chops extra thick... just the way that David likes it."
I thought that maybe you could go there and spy on him.
I'm getting on that train.
What are you going to do to him?
Shut him up for good after I get the diamond.
"Now go on home, wait for my call."
"All right, but be careful."
MAN ON PA:
"Your attention, please."
The return portion of tickets purchased in the East require validation before boarding your train.
Validation desks are located adjacent to the stationmaster's office.
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry."
"Hi, sonny."
"Oh, don't you touch me."
I'm not going to touch you.
You leave me alone!
"But, sonny."
(GROANING)
I'm not going to hurt you.
You're not?
Of course not.
"Oh, then will you buy me a ticket, please?"
"No, I think you should let your daddy buy you a ticket."
(WAILING) I want a ticket!
Buy me a ticket!
I want a ticket!
(EXCLAIMS)
What are you doin' to the kid?
"My uncle won't buy me a ticket, and I got the money."
I hate goofs who pick on kids.
Goofs?
Goofs!
"I hate goofs, too."
Then buy the kid a ticket.
Think maybe she arranged to duck out and meet him somewhere else?
She just went down to get me some more coffee.
Millie's Barbecue.
Maybe that's around on the other road.
I was beginning to think you wouldn't come.
"Edie, always I come when you need me."
"Axel, I've so much to explain to you."
"No, no."
Not now.
I-
"- I only wanted to help you, but I did everything wrong."
I should have told you in the beginning.
I don't want to hear.
"Come, get into the car."
I have money.
Come.
- What?
- And no one will catch us.
"And whatever has happened, I don't want to know."
Come.
[Mason] Axel.
So.
Who tells you where to find us?
Never mind that.
"Axel, as your attorney--"
You stay out of this.
"Well, they can't have her."
Somers he was no good.
"Take it easy, Mr. Norstaad."
It's not the lady I'm arresting for murder.
It's you.
"Now, Mr. Pedersen, we've heard testimony that on the afternoon of Somers' murder,"
Well the thing is I've been living a lie.
Just one?
"I'm living, like, 20."
What's yours?
"Well, I..."
I never actually had cancer.
I'll see you.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Flat out refused.
"Yeah, isn't that just like him?"
"You know, he has to be the only one who has them."
"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister."
"- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi."
- What?
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?
I never said hi.
When did I say hi?
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.
"No, no, Kramer."
You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.
I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship.
"If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
It's like a game of tag.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
You're going to the bookstore to see Jake.
- So what if I do?
Get the fuck out of my way!
- Ma'am!
Ma'am!
- Let's go.
Tom James!
Tom James!
Tom James!
Thank you.
"Okay, I admit, this isn't boring."
Why make the total of electoral votes an even number?
- Insanity?
"- Listen, I know this is a long night."
You're tired and you're cold and your legs ache and you need the bathroom.
"Boy, do you need the bathroom."
That fucking guy with his fucking charm and his fucking son and his fucking wheelchair with his spine all fucked up.
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.
"And before she died at the age of 89, she told me a secret that she kept for almost 50 years."
The story concerns...
"Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James."
How about it?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wow.
Do I know how to pick 'em?
Yep.
"Well, thank you so much for being here."
I know it's been a wait.
And we really do appreciate your presence.
"What a night, right?"
It's the night of nights.
"Um, you know what I want to do?"
"Their family thinks he was forced by the perpetrator, who is considered dangerous."
"Take this, Beto."
Do you want to go to the hospital?
"- No, I just want to go home."
"Look at my eyes, Beto."
Bye.
May I offer you a drink?
A friend of mine was driving a Tsuru thinking that nobody knew him.
"He was kidnapped, I don't know how much he paid."
Now he drives an armoured Hummer with bodyguards.
"The dinner is ready, everybody to the table!"
"Mom, what's going to happen to Beto?"
Do you know where I can find a job?
Merry Christmas!
"Kids, before you open them, give the gifts to Beto and the maids."
"Here, Beto."
- Thank you.
"That's nice, what do we have here?"
A shirt and a watch.
- Terrific.
Are they from you or from your mom?
From Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus!
They're very nice.
Thank you for giving them to me and to Santa because he sent them.
What did he say?
"Here, give this gift to Beto?"
Yes.
"- Well, thank you."
For Celi...
"Thanks, madam."
Elvira...
Sounds good.
Wait.
That's it?
What do you want me to say?
I get it.
Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
"Yeah, but..."
"I am about to go to war with New Bern, Kansas, the home of the nearest Costco."
Today is already just about as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
"Mom, Dad, there's a chance we may have to leave here today,"
"and we might not be able to make it back, so I just wanted to..."
We just wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch from the IRS?
The one that wanted to take everything you've ever worked for?
"Mom, Dad, this is Mimi."
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
"And,of course, Bonnie is... she's just wonderful."
And I've really enjoyed living with them and...
"Oh, great."
What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly...
I...
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-What-What...
What are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's gotta be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No!
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night stand material, Ted."
"Oh, oh, here's your mom."
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother's not one-night stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
"It wasn't night, and we weren't standing."
Hey-oh.
- That didn't happen.
- You're right.
It didn't.
- You just winked.
"- No, I didn't."
- You just did it again!
"- Look, bottom line."
I need you to proxy-bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow."
That'd be good on a hat.
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
- You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
It just seems surreal.
Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
That's exactly why we're gonna do it.
"We're gonna go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious."
"Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you it was so that I could do things like this."
"I could bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date try to be normal."
Have you ever even been on a double date before?
"Oh, absolutely."
"Uh, '72."
Hef and the twins.
- What?
- Yeah.
Playmates.
I got Miss June.
- Are you serious?
- Mm.
Miss Sommers?
Yes.
"Hi, Pearl."
Hi.
This is my daughter Annabelle.
"Of course, Jeremy's friend."
"- Nice to see you, Miss Sommers."
- Oh.
Jenna.
This property was in my brother-in-law's family for generations.
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.
Used to be one of those old-fashioned drugstore thingies.
- An apothecary?
- Yeah.
You don't say.
Sorry if it's musty.
- My mum.
"She can't keep a single secret, the pissed, old cow."
She's in SPAT with Suzie and all.
"To begin with, I feel terrible about it now, but I was like:"
"""Why shouldn't she kill herself if she wants to?"""
- She's got me.
"- But I didn't know that then, did I?"
- I know.
I made a complete ass of myself.
"- Yes, you did."
I enjoyed it.
"You know, I sort of tried to draw fire."
"Obviously, I thought the worse I looked, the better Marcus would look."
"In that case, Marcus looked fantastic."
Okay.
Can I come in?
Maybe.
- I'm a bit busy.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Doing what?
"Watching ""Countdown""."
Let me ask you something.
What would you rather do?
"Watch ""Countdown"" or have sex with me?"
Stuart's track record here.
Very good performance last week.
"He came in with a 44 and came out on Friday with a 72, which is the second..."
Every man is an island.
I stand by that.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
Is-is Harriet.
"Look, I'm sorry."
- I lost my head out there.
- Look.
There.
"- No, no."
- I was just... but you can't go...
"I mean, we need you."
Harriet would never stand for it.
"Please, won't you reconsider?"
"You know, it's not about what happened outside tonight."
It really isn't.
But Golly...
"I just... no, I think it's time."
I really do.
"Harriet can take care of herself now, so she should."
But Harriet's just...
She's just a little girl.
"You know, it's the right thing."
"It's the right thing for all of us... for me, for you and for Harriet."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, I am."
"""'The time has come,"" the Walrus said,"""
"""To talk of many things..."
"""Of shoes and ships and sealing wax..."""
"""Of cabbages and kings..."
"""And why the sea is boiling hot..."
"And whether pigs have wings."""
Where you going to go?
"Well, I don't really know."
I'm thinking I may travel.
Are you going to go be some other kid's nanny now?
"Now, I'm asking you for the last time."
Who were they?
"Now, you're not going to eat until you talk, so you may as well talk now."
"Now listen, Johnny, here."
Listen to me.
"Now, you tell me who those other fellows were and I'll let you go, see?"
"Come on, who were they, huh?"
Who were they?
- Lock him up.
- Mighty cold for this kid in there.
"Well, maybe it'll freeze him into talking."
Okay.
Come on.
I'm gonna find out who those other kids were if it's the last thing I do.
"All right, kid."
Come on.
Get out of there.
You got enough.
Go get your chart and report to work detail.
- I'll try and get you some grub later on.
- Thank you.
Wrap this around you.
I know you don't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
"Here you are, kid."
I can still race!
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go!
Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
The rookie fired his crew chief.
The third this season!
- Says he likes working alone.
"- Go, go!"
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
"Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up."
"Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!"
"Come on, come on, come on!"
We need tires now!
"Come on, let's go!"
"- No, no, no, no!"
"No tires, just gas!"
- What?
"You need tires, you idiot!"
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Right.
No tires again.
"That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him."
He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
"This is it, Darrell."
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
Okay.
KEN:
So enjoy the crab.
"And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas."
Bethie.
Your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
I know.
And somehow even he's married.
[KEN CHUCKLES]
"Oh, honey, look."
Back when everyone was just going to camp at the Y you borrowed my New York Times found some arts camp in the Berkshires wrote away for information and got accepted on your own.
You never did things like everyone else.
Why not?
Because that's you.
That's why you're my favorite daughter.
You're not supposed to say that.
I don't give a shit.
"I'm retired, I'll say what I want to."
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
Come here.
Stop.
KEN:
"It's true, though."
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.
Come on.
Sorry I'm late.
"No, it's okay."
I like a little time before a blind date.
"Prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars..."
This is a dream come true for me.
- Yes.
- Blue balls.
They also cut out the cucumbers in there.
I was thinking that.
There was the biggest cucumber you've ever seen.
They cut that out?
"- I mean, you guys cut that out?"
"- Oh, yeah."
You know how you popped out of that tree and said a dozen different things?
- We have all those on the DVD.
"- Oh, there you go."
- My favorite...
- And they're terrific.
- he came to rescue me.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.
You look like you have the little Charlie Brown tree on your head.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Cutest.
"I love when you say, ""This tree is drunk."""
I'll text you.
Okay?
Poor Gary.
"He eats shit all night, he doesn't get anywhere with Tris."
He's a sympathetic character.
But it's incredible because he hangs in.
That's Sunshine Theater.
- He's the new Nick.
- He is the new...
Exactly.
"In a few weeks, he'll be going through what Nick's going through."
That...
"A moment, please."
I'd like to bring your attention... to the next item on our menu.
Fish cooked in mayonaisse.
We owe Coronel Eliot our gratitude for this repast... and the good Colonel tells us that this dish is called...
Siren.
"- Do you know it, Captain?"
"- Yes, I know it very well."
"Siren, the mermaid of Naples."
Extremely rare.
But I've seen it several times...
- Where?
- At the aquarium.
"You can't be referring to Siren, the seductress in Homer's Odyssey."
Wretches.
It's just an ordinary fish.
Mermaids don't exist.
"My god, it's a baby!"
A cooked baby!
We have to bury it!
Cover her up!
Cover her up!
"I swear, it's an edible fish, General."
"It's a fish, Mr. General..."
"It's a fish, I swear."
A fish!
It don't care what they say.
My god!
"- Well, in Philadelphia..."
"- Gentlemen, sit, please."
Please Mrs. Wyatt.
"Now, the good lord knows what Mark Cork thinks... of fish cooked in mayonaisse."
"I don't like war either, but someone has to lead."
- Lucy Coleson.
- I can't believe that you...
Me either.
"Look at our son over there, eh?"
- He's perfect.
"- Yeah, and then you come along"
- and you expose him to all this...
- Me?
I'm just...
"I mean, what gives him the right to‐‐to touch you like that?"
‐ Like what?
"‐ You know what I mean, like he owns you."
"‐ Hey, hey, I'm here with you, and this is where I want to be, okay?"
Please come back to bed.
‐ It is not okay.
‐ It is not okay.
It's never gonna be okay.
Ah.
"I got it, okay."
I just‐‐
I got it.
It's...
‐ For you.
‐ Last night... ‐ We all made mistakes.
Myself included.
"I got us into this financial mess, and when I had an opportunity to help get us out,"
"I, uh..."
I‐I handled it poorly.
I‐I handled it poorly.
But I've been thinking and making alternate plans.
There are people we can reach out to to call on before we let the counsel know.
"‐ I could turn you in, for Silas."
And we needed to find us some shelter!
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
Shh!
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!
But we are equals.
"Oh, man."
Of course we are...
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this...
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
Wh... wh... wha... wha...
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
And Puss was never seen again.
Ha ha.
The End.
No!
That's not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel.
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you!
Ohh.
You're killing me.
It was Prince Charming!
"He was packing heat, and he wanted revenge!"
"Honestly, I think only about me and my work."
"Do you like stars, up in the sky?"
Stars?
I've never really thought about them.
What makes your life difficult?
My mom.
She makes things the hardest.
There's no end to it.
She's ruined everything for me.
And I hate her the most.
"I really hate her, but she's still my mother."
- Director Kim.
- Did you get some rest?
"Yes, a little."
I'm sitting on the stairs looking out at the sea.
There's a lovely tree in the garden.
I'm having sushi in the restaurant next to that grocery store.
I've ordered too much for myself.
Would you two ladies like to join me?
I love sushi.
Won't you feel uncomfortable with us there?
"No, come."
Come and enjoy the food.
"Okay, I'll be right down."
It'll take about ten minutes.
"Alright, I'll be waiting."
You haven't changed.
You're not going for a walk?
You're all ready.
But I don't want to go today.
Really?
"Then, take a rest."
Listen!
Listen!
Dad!
"She's making you fool,"
"Try it once, It's fun,"
Laila Jee!
"Laxminarayan you're here, Please come, please come,"
"So nice to see you, Complete 900,000."
"Count them, Now where is my car?"
"It's just between polishing, You people just make it fast,"
"Shri Narayn's here, It's complete cash, count them."
What's this?
"I got the bundle of 10, what to do?"
Is this the bundle of 10-10?
"It's just a underwear,"
"She calls bundle to underwear, It's underwear."
"I keep the bundle inside, Where this underwear come from?"
"These are my designs, Where you get it from?"
"Hey, Hi!"
Jia!
"You, How dare you come at my front?"
"You told Laxminarayan that take my samples and shoot me,"
Dad!
Did you say her like that?
"First tell me, who is she?"
"Dad, she's Jia, whose designs you came here to take, But I didn't meet her,"
Namaste!
Namaste!
Who is he?
"I am Laxminarayan,"
Then who was he?
"One minute, One minute, Who was who?"
This is Max and he isn't the groom.
"No, no, no."
He's single and gay.
Yes.
"So gay, he got kicked out of One Direction."
Why don't you two walk off somewhere and share poignant coming-out stories.
Go.
- But Max--
"- Oh, you heard the women, go."
Can do.
"Ladies, look around, we'll be back... in about a month."
Tahiti anyone?
I'm just Crazy Carl.
The ladies love it.
Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are.
Really expensive donations to Goodwill.
Is this one bad?
No.
That's a Vera Wang.
But this is a very wrong.
Hide it.
Ew.
And it's evil twin.
"Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits came with feathers."
Oh my God.
This the worst thing I've ever seen.
And I've seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk.
Who are you calling a prostitute?
"This, we've got to hide."
I can't get this dress off.
Just tell it you work at Google and you're thinking of settling down.
Lift it up.

We did call Zingo!
...Things just keep getting weirder as we continue our competition for tips in San Francisco.
Wow.
Get a room.
"It's our 25th episode, and to celebrate, they've given me control of the show."
"Now, okay, admittedly, started out with a bang with the crash, but now you're driving around San Francisco on a pink scooter."
What's up with that?
"It's not a pink scooter, and what could be better?"
You get to drive around in these amazing cars and get paid for it.
Amazing cars?
You're in a beetle.
At least Adam got to drive a Bentley.
"Yeah, but, I mean, the whole goal was to make money, and I was 20 bucks up, and the night was still young."

"- What's up, guys?"
"- Hey, I'm Rutledge."

How are you?

Great.

"Hey, Norman, you know what?"
"There's a place I know that I'd like to show you, that no one knows about."
Not even you.
It's my secret place.
I know every spot within three miles of Peyton Place.
Not this one.
Come on.
You were right.
I never knew this place was here.
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.
And now you.
It's beautiful.
I've just decided.
This is the last time I'm ever going to come here.
Why?
"Oh, I'm gonna leave it for somebody else to find."
Maybe your children will discover it.
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.
"Oh, Allison."
What's wrong with that?
"No children to grow up unhappy, nobody gets hurt except maybe me."
That's the worst kind of emotional maladjustment.
Who said so?
- A book I read.
- What book?
I sent for a book.
"It was $ 1.98, in a plain wrapper."
- A plain wrapper?
you cut some down and bundle it up for her.
they'll have me to deal with.
Tell the men that.
All of this in one day?
!
The man who owned the field was very kind.
He let me take all that I wanted.
And then he invited me to eat with him.
I think the others were very surprised.
Who was it?
What was his name?
Boaz.
Boaz?
You know him?
he is my nearest kinsman.
then... then he must marry you.
Get up for the Rams.!
"In the second half, Arthur tries to pick up where he left off."
Penetration move by Agee.
Slapped out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.
"Ooh, and a nice fake and a score."
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.
You're just out there playing individual basketball.
Completely.
"hey, hey, guys."
No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going.
Remember?
"Let's go, Marshall!"
Let's go!
"The lights shine on me, the one who really loves you."
I practice my lines.
How do I perform flawlessly and make your heart flutter?
"No matter how many times I've suffered defeat,"
I still won't turn back.
Because you have the smile I want to possess every time we meet.
Sometimes I doubt myself.
I blame myself for not being lucky enough.
"I'm scared I'll spoil you with too much affection, but I'd still rather believe..."
Baby.
Love is an extravagant solo show.
I'm not afraid of ridicule.
"Eventually, you'll be moved."
Love is solo.
"Oh, S - o - l - o"
"Love is a cruel solo show, up on the stage."
Your glance is overflowing with sparks.
"Love is solo, the most beautiful extravagance."
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo Solo.
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo Solo.
Love is like a battle arena.
Solo Solo.
S - o - l - o
Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
Love is a solo show.
"Die, asshole."
"Oh, Ilia, that feels good."
Then I'll make you feel even better.
"Ilia, can't we have sex today?"
You know it's against the rules.
"If we do it, I'd be fired."
Then I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.
"I don't want that, but..."
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Feel good?
Feel good?
Feel good?
I'm gonna come!
"Come, I'm coming too!"
I'm coming!
Ilia.
It's perfume.
I hope you like it.
"I've been with lots of delivery girls, but no one's been as genuine as you."
Service tells you a lot about a girl.
"If you don't mind, will you go out with me?"
I'm sorry.
Of course...
"I'm an idiot, what was I thinking?"
I'm going home to Korea.
I can't take this.
"No, please take it."
"It's my first gift to a girl, ever."
"I talked with the clerk, wondering what you'd like."
"That itself was fun, my heart was bouncing."
My heart was bouncing.
"I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?"
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.
How about this to begin with?
Not that it's enough.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's much more than most people pay.
It doesn't seem near enough to me.
"Harry, listen..."
"Oh, sorry."
"Come along, will you?"
It's getting late.
Well...
But...
But you aren't really going just because he says?
"No, no, no."
But I have to go now.
But look here.
Don't you understand?
I ain't no...
I ain't no...
"No, I know you're not."
You're a girl with her heart just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.
"Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful about the company you pick, huh?"
"Well, but..."
"But you are here, ain't you?"
"Yes, but I shouldn't be."
"And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be."
"Well, I..."
I picks only them as wants my company.
- I'm sorry.
No.
I'm here.
Guess Daddy doesn't love you after all.
We got the president.
Bring him on down.
"Back to your office, sir."
"I have John Cale on the line, sir."
Cale?
You put her on the goddamn phone right now.
"Hi, John."
They have the president.
"John, I want you to listen to me."
Help is not coming.
I said they have the president.
They called a strike on the White House.
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.
They cannot do that.
"They still have hostages, they still have Emily."
"I'm so, so sorry."
I was wrong about you..
"but there's nothing you can do, John."
"If you stay, you're gonna die."
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me..
and I am not gonna disappear on her.
So you tell me how much time I have.
You only have eight minutes left to get them out.
"Goodbye, Carol."
Clear out!
We're moving back now!
Everybody's gotta move back!
"- Well, that's..."
- l'll get my stuff.
Okay.
Should I?
Do we have...
You take a second.
You go ahead and eat.
I'm still trying to find where everything is in this house.
"Oh, congratulations, by the way."
Thank you.
"Have you guys set, or maybe you haven't..."
"- Oh, May 1 2th."
"- Well, that will be beautiful then."
Thank you.
"I need to get ready myself, actually."
"You don't need any more, do you, Jessie?"
"- Oh, no."
- Here you go.
"- Hey, you."
- l'll be down in a couple of minutes.
"Jess, you almost ready?"
"Yeah, I just have to get my things."
I can't get him to tell me what's going on.
- He's hiding something?
"- l think he's terrified, ashamed, and he doesn't want me to worry."
But he's not hiding something.
I don't know.
You're the one who thinks he's been a criminal the whole time.
- You said you didn't trust him.
- l didn't trust him emotionally.
You don't get sent to prison for that.
"Oh, God."
- Yes.
- You must be working part-time.
- Yeah.
Would you like some stew before you go?
I'm buying.
Hey...
How much could you make?
Hey!
How much do you make right now?
"- 6,030 won."
"- 6,030 won."
Please eat.
"But, you said... he was going around bragging about stabbing a man?"
"Oh, I think that was a lie."
But I think it's someone Han Gyul knows.
"It's Han Gyul, the kid that I fought last time?"
Not fought.
The one who beat you up.
"Hey, I didn't get beat up."
I fought...
I fought...
- Let's just say that then.
- Let's just say that.
But the suspect that Detective Im saw wasn't a young kid.
"He said that there were two men, in their late 30s."
Yes... yes.
So... you're saying that there's a young kid involved too?
"Then, Chan Gyu."
It could be... that Park Seon Woo committed this crime in two parts.
One stabbed him first.
Then the guys cleaned up after.
"And anyway, since it's true that he held that knife..."

I fired a point-blank clap bomb directly into Barts's chest tonight.
Fired a point-blank point bomb straight in Yorkie's junk.
And what if it does?
That means you're in contact with God or the Angel of Death.
Who are you in contact with?
We can't stay here like this.
Who's to say that within a week... I have a feeling it'll happen in the next three days.
You keep repeating the same thing!
"Look, Keyvan, you know what?"
Give me three days.
Just three.
Perhaps it will happen.
- And what if it doesn't?
- let's say it will.
We're wasting time.
Can't you plan things?
Plan things?
"No, I can't do that."
We say the same thing.
"If you can't do it, who can?"
Only God can.
"If it happens, we shoot our report and return to Tehran."
All right.
We just need to know what to do.
Say it takes three months...
- Behzad.
- Yes.
I've brought you bread.
Put it over there.
"Listen, kid, can't you hold your tongue?"
I can.
Who told you to talk about her son leaving?
I can't lie.
It's not a matter of lying.
So Maurice isn't Jewish?
I don't know.
"I said to him, ""What do you care?"
"""I'm not asking you to pray on Yom Kippur,"
"""just say you're Jewish even if you aren't."""
But he refused.
Next year in Jerusalem.
Bye.
Where is he now?
He lives in the Le Panier district.
"Don't ask me where, he didn't say-."
"But there's a woman he took care of, maybe his mother or sister-."
We sent food there sometimes.
I can give you the address.
- Are you sure this is the address?
- I'm positive.
Now what?
There's no mother and no grandmother!
"This is Le Panier, right?"
You want to wander around aimlessly?
- Why not?
- We don't even have an address.
So what do you suggest?
- Why don't you check the phone book?
"- We did, when you were asleep."
Then look again.
I'm going to look around.
And ask people if they're Maurice Leon?
- Knock on their doors?
"- Yeah, okay?"
Why didn't Mom tell us anything?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
What?
You were all here?
Clark came to apologize to Grandma.
He found out about Grandpa by reading that telegram.
"But Father, you said..."
I'm sorry.
It was because I was stupid.
Hello.
"My son, Tateo, and my daughter, Minako."
I'm Clark.
How do you do?
"My son, Shinjiro."
My daughter.
They're adorable.
I'm so happy to meet you.
After August 9... let's all go... to Hawaii with Aunty.
My uncle...
Right here?
And this is... the monument built for the children who died on that day.
With these children... my uncle died.
Just where did it happen?
That's something we just can't find.
You can't find?
That day... the whole town was in flames.
And this place was filled with people who came here to try and escape from it.
But the school had also been burned.
The people were burned.
"Iron, everything."
These people are the classmates of the children who died here.
These people...
"Somehow, they scare me."
It's because... those are the people who witnessed the worst fear.
"No, I can't forget him."
That's what I thought.
I knew that very well.
But he doesn't live in our world.
Right?
That's not true!
Are you saying that when you're dancing with me it's like dancing with Kayama-san?
That's crazy.
"Hey, should I wait for you?"
Wait?
That's...
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it here and now.
I'm not thinking about getting married now.
You didn't like the way I said it?
"No, that's not it."
"It's just that when I see my mother and father,"
I feel nervous about marriage.
Can't you help your mother?
My mother's problems go beyond the problems in our family.
I'm my mother's unfulfilled dream.
I'll taking care of your dancing.
But marriage is frightening to me.
I have the feeling that I'll end up like my mother.
Oh!
"Shinako, when did you get here?"
"Hello there, NMzu-san."
Did you see Kayama-sensei?
No.
He got sick and went somewhere.
I met Tomoko.
Tomoko?
How is she?
James:
I found the backpack.
"The dead kid's best friend, a nice young man named Liam."
He took it.
"Funny how he didn't mention that in his statement, huh?"
You stay away from my daughter.
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm heading to the best friend's house right now.
"Maybe you should, uh, just meet me there."

"Say hello, Liam."
Hello.
"Right, now tell the nice FBI agent what you didn't tell him last time."

I took Kevin's backpack.
He stole his best friend's backpack after he died.
Liam:
I just wanted his headphones.
He didn't need them anymore.
I swear.
Touching.
"Anyway, he kept the backpack and, uh, this was inside."
Can you guys let me down now?
How did you convince Gracie to let you into my stuff?
- Mom.
You know exactly what Daddy wants.
And you know how to make him happy and how to make him miserable.
Every woman does.
"If you're bored, Mom, you know, that's your fault, not his."
Bored.
"You've always been your father's daughter, and if you want to side with him this time, that's fine."
"- This is not about sides, Mom."
- Don't!
"Don't pretend that you know what goes into a 30-year marriage, because you don't have a clue."
You don't have a clue.

"Yeah, I'm trying to picture it."
Where's your office?
It's Zander-Cohen.
It's a pretty big architecture firm.
Impressive.
Do you have a view?
Yeah.
It's a nice view.
- Promise me you'll be careful.

"- Mom, I..."
I can't promise you anything.

Hey!
"Emma, are you okay?"
Yeah.
I didn't mean to scare you.
"No, uh, it's just early."
"Um, what's up?"
My dad's back.
I don't know.
You're the only one who knew him before he left.
And I haven't slept all night and I'm totally freaking out.
Wow.
He just shows up...
literally when you get back to town?
How long has he been here?
I don't know.
I didn't interrogate him.
Doesn't it seem a little suspicious?
"You know, like, the timing of it all?"
"What do you mean ""the timing of it""?"
"Um, I mean, like, where was he when all of our friends, everyone we knew, was getting slaughtered?"
When you were actually in danger?
I'm good.
All that wouldn't have happened if you didn't let her get under your skin.
You're right.
She's driving me crazy.
And I'm driving Anna-Kat crazy.
"Next thing you know, we've got a backpack full of cat heads."
- What?
- It's a medical term.
"No matter what my mother does,"
I'm going to ignore her and stay calm.
Or you can sit down and finally tell her how you feel.
"God, no."
I'm saving that stuff to say to her coffin.
"Angela, I really need you for Thanksgiving to be a buffer for my mom."
Mnh-mnh.
Too late.
I'm already Doris' buffer.
Ugh.
My parents are so grateful for all the money I give them on Thanksgiving.
- It's disgusting.
- I really need a buffer!
"Hi, everybody!"
- Hey.
"- Hi, Viv."
"Oh, my gosh!"
That cheeseburger is huge.
It's just the size that it comes as.
It's enormous.
"It's a normal-sized cheeseburger, Viv."
I love cheeseburgers.
I eat them all the time.
Sure you do.
I always think of it as sleeping resting up from the pounding it takes during the day.
- Do you work at night?
"- Yes, quite often."
You don't realize the preparation it takes to be a teacher.
It's like... .
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them.
I want so much for them.
"It's more than a job to you, isn't it?"
I didn't mean to sound like the dedicated idealist.
"Well, there's nothing wrong in that."
Connie.
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to.
I enjoyed everything.
Including the dancing?
Including.
"You're wasting your time, Mike."
I had my love a long time ago.
"And when my husband died, I came back here."
And I've had no time for anything but Allison and the dress shop.
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.
"- Look, Connie."
If I were...
- I said it's too late.
I made my choice long ago.
Please take me home.
Sure.
"Selena, let's get married."
You mean now?
Sure.
Serving drinks to the meanie moms or watching Marly's husband massage your gums with his tongue?
"I know, I'm sorry."
I should have locked the door.
Yeah.
That's pretty much the only thing that was wrong with it.
"You know, I'm not Marly's biggest fan, but she really doesn't deserve this."
"Yeah, I know."
"It's wrong, it's wrong."
But I hope that you and I can still be friends.
"Yeah, I don't think so."
Why?
Because I'm Portuguese?
Because I'm a maid?
"Uh, no."
"It's because, well you're kind of a whore."
"- So, what's up for tomorrow?"
"- Well, we should definitely get together."
"I could swing by, maybe we'll catch a movie."
Great.
- I don't want to.
"- Oh, thank God."
"When you were married, we spent about three and a half hours alone together."
- And that was over 15 years.
- That seemed about the right amount.
So I'll see you around.
Maybe we can do something next spring.
"- That would be great, Dad."
- What?
- Bye.
- Bye.

"Tomorrow, bean sprout soup."
Okay.
I'll make some delicious soup for you.
"Ah, what a day."
"Tired, huh?"
"Whenever you have time, you can stop by anytime."
Just come and rest in our room.
I'll play really nice songs for you.
"Oh, my!"
You've drunk so much all by yourself.
"I've come by myself, you see."
Why?
What about your companions?
I came alone.
That movie director came by today.
That man you came with last time.
Should I give him a ring?
He's probably too drunk.
"He came with another woman, you know."
"I began talking to him, and he said that woman resembled you very much."
- He said she looked like me?
"- Yes, that's what he said."
"I mean both of you are pretty tall, but you're far more beautiful."
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
"Tell me, who's behind all this?"
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.
I knew you would never tell me.
Take care ofJenny.
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.
We'll stay here tonight.
"Sidney will bring me my money, and we'll leave tomorrow."
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here.
Don't worry.
This place isn't easy to find.
Why is it so dark?
I can hardly see anything.
"Jeffrey, turn on the lights."
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Jeffrey.
Please turn them on.
There's been a power failure.
Will your friend come back with the money?
I'm sure he will.
I'm sure he will.
Boss.
"Here's the $1 00,000."
Please check it.
You think he can kill Jeffrey?
"Boss, Sidney Fung is here."
What if he betrays you again?
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.
- Where isJeffrey's money?
One of my tweets was:
"""Hey @Rathmines swimming pool,"
"""is there a swim tonight at 9pm?"""
"That got 1,200 likes and 400 retweets."
"Well, let's see if Ed Sheeran is up there."
"Yes, second!"
APPLAUSE
"Yes, it's Ed Sheeran!"
"Ed Sheeran is an award-winning singer-songwriter, and national treasure."
Is there anything he can't do?
Yes.
Open a fridge without getting sunburned.
"That's it for part one, see you after the break!"
Welcome back.
We're still trying to guess the most popular Brits.
"OK, fingers on buzzers."
BUZZER
Rob?
Is it Anthony Joshua?
The boxing legend.
"You met him recently, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did a documentary about him."
"I met Klitschko, the person he's fighting, as well."
They're such big man and it's so...
I feel pathetic.
LAUGHTER
"No, but, like, they're 6ft 6in, but their body..."
They're just so muscly.
We're supposed to be both grown-ups.
"In fairness, he does do a lot of training."
Have a look at this.
HE GROANS
"Hey, come on."
"A little, you know--jesus."
"I mean, people with cancer, they have issues, franc."
Jesus christ.
"You know what I'm gonna do,"
"I'm gonna take a little bit of this, and I'm going to make a donation in mike's mom's name."
"Whoa, whoa, hold up.Before you give all our money away,"
- what kind of cancer are we giving to?
- Yeah.
"I don't know, ass, face, skin, brains, all of it."
- Cock?
- Cock and balls.Everything.
"All right, I'm in."
Sweet.
What about dogs with cancer?
"Hey, dogs are welcome."
"- All right, I'm in."
- Sweet.
Breasts?
Breast cancer.How about that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, what?"
"I mean, we're going to a titty bar."
"It's like an investment, you know."
"I got it, cat cancer."
"Titty bar made me think of pussy and, you know."
"All set downstairs, boys."
"Hey, derek, we're creating a special slush fund for cancer research.You want in?"
"Cock, tits, ass, animal, all taken."
What about the liver?
- I'll drink to that.
- Duh.
I decided to find out.
- How much is she on the rim f or?
- Sixteen thousand.
Let's see what I can do with the same numbers.
Did you ride in on the killing?
Her horse stumbled.
Give me the 7-11 dice.
They're all 7-11 dice.
It depends on the player's talent.
- Not the luck?
- l was returning your compliment.
"You shoot honestly, we give you honest dice."
Open up the table.
"You won't mind if I watch, I hope."
"Not at all, if you think you can take it."
- What's the limit?
"- For Mrs. Chandler, no limit."
We shoot 2000.
- Seven.
- Seven the winner.
- The 4000 rides.
"- Ad infinitum, if you wish."
Eleven the winner.
"7-11, your system, Dusty."
"Once more, and we're even."
- We'd better stop with what we have.
"- No, we'll get even."
The house will change the dice.
"That's your privilege, f riend."
That squares you with the house.
You think there's something wrong?
"I never think when I gamble, I just feel."
It's humiliating.
Yeah?
"How much did you lose, 500?"
A grand?
This is a way for us to get close again.
"Hey,"
I almost got killed a few weeks ago.
Sorry if it's affected your sex life.
That's not what I meant.
"Why don't you tell them,princess?"
Huh?
It was 3.
"Ladies, tango comes from the portuguese"
"""tangere."""
To touch.
It's all about touch.Not talk.
"Turns out talk is cheap,bro,huh?"
"A little tight,don't you think?"
It's fine.
We'll adjust it when we get in the ambulance.
"Man,look at this,my fingers are turning blue."
"I'm thinking your boyfriend's the senior guy here, maybe he can take a look."
My partner is busy.
I can wait.
"You didn't mean ""senior guy,"" did you?"
You meant white guy.
Is that what you meant?
Ha ha!
That's what he means.Kick his racist ass!
"You,shut up."
"And you, a little respect,or we'll leave you all here."
"I don't need your help,son."
She's mad at you now.
Has been for about a week.
- So is she...
- Pulling...
To the right?
Red 23!
"Excuse me, Miss."
Hi.
- You dropped this.
- Keep it.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
That's what I'm hoping.
Red 21!
Holy bananas.
You're really mad at me.
"- I feel sorry for you, actually."
- Why is that?
Because of all the things right in front of your face that you refuse to see.
Like what?
Like me.
"Oh, well."
I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to.
You know what?
"You're wasting time, 'cause Pete's in danger."
"Yeah, well, so are you, right?"
In danger if you're who you say you are?
"Okay, fine."
Here's what you and I both know but we never talk about it.
All right?
That I don't trust you.
That I need you to tell me the truth.
And to not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
Couldn't win this war without them.
Captain.
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?
"Muldoon and MacDaniel, in those choppers fly low over the treetops and hope to draw V.C. Gunfire."
You mean there are V.C. That close?
Yes.
"Mr. Beckworth, I have V.C. In my own strike force."
Pardon me.
I have to check the perimeter.
"There they are, building a boat bridge."
MacDANIEL:
"They're not Cong, they're hard-core regulars."
Petersen you worry me.
Three tours of duty and you're still acting like a civilian.
"Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine."
I believe in my comfort.
We got the tin.
What about the .50 caliber?
Don't worry.
Next drop.
How'd you do it?
A guy in Khe Sahn wanted 2 cases of bourbon.
Bourbon!
How'd you get 2 cases of bourbon?
From a straight leg in supply in Bien Hoa.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Why would he give you that much booze?
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.
Traded him what?
We have an eyewitness that saw him dump a body.
- Even you said it was a cop.
- I said it could be.
Now we have a witness that said it wasn't.
"- Dad, let's go in."
"- Sit down, I'll be right with you."
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
"They're going to throw the book at him, Nick."
Your son or not.
The criminal court of Pennsylvania is now in session.
The sentencing for the State versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
The Honourable Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
"- Mr. Gunther, where is your client?"
"- We don't know, Your Honour."
Jimmy...
"Son, listen to me."
Listen to Daddy.
We'll talk to them.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
They never found her.
"Jimmy, you don't have to do this."
"Cops don't go to prison, Dad."
I don't go!
Are you gonna give him a push?
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise?
No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
1:00 in the morning.
"If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here."
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
"By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor."
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, Eddie."
- So?
"- It's running fine, Mr. Klein."
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
"- All right, what do I owe you?"
"Hello, doc."
"Hi, Connie."
"- Just coffee, please."
- Right.
"Who's that, doc?"
That's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.
"She has a daughter in the senior class, Allison."
Beautiful woman.
She's a widow.
"Born here, but she had ambitions, and left."
Married in New York to some ad genius.
"When he died, she came back here."
- I'd like to meet her.
- Wouldn't do you no good.
Bring your coffee.
"Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi, the new school principal."
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I hear about you every day from my daughter.
You've been working kind of late?
"No, I've been to the movies."
Allison's giving a party.
What does she plan to do after graduation?
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her in college.
It's too bad she has no brothers and sisters.
- Why do you say that?
- Just that I'm against only-child families.
Only children receive all the attention of the parents.
- Good and bad.
- I don't think Allison turned out badly.
Okay.
Bye.
I wish there was more we could do.
"Honey, you're his lawyer, not his guardian."
I know.
"I know, I know."
In the morning I'll take him to Child Service.
What kind of mother just abandons her child?
What happens if they don't find her?
He'll go into the system.
Foster care till he's 18.
"I mean, they'll try and place him, but...at his age, it'll be impossible."
You know what I was thinking?
"I think that this being your last night and all, we should do something special."
I don't know what.
Possibly get a couple of tattoos or some hookers and lose out virginity.
Ok ?
"Okay, dude, I don't know."
There's a shark movie at the IMAX.
If that's what you're into.
I just want to take it easy.
How was your swim?
It was great.
What's that?
It's a model home.
I build them.
"Well, the real ones, not that one."
Can you build me one?
Sorry.
Bad joke.
So...
"last supper, huh?"
"Oh, my..."
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?
"Okay, alright."
"Alright, saved by mum."
The best way to actually just stop her from calling is...
"I don't know, answer it."
"Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms I just don't wanna open right now, so..."
She's worried.
You're her son.
"You've been travelling, and I just think if you speak to her, then..."
"Yeah, well, I still live at home with her back in Syracuse."
- That's cool.
That's fine.
- Yeah.
I was taking care of my dad.
"Oh, shit."
Is he...?
- ...okay?
"- No, he died."
"- Oh, my God."
I'm sorry.
- Last year.
"No, it's okay."
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.
"Oh, that must have been really..."
uh... tough.
"Yeah, he was my best friend."
Sometimes he'd just look at me and wouldn't even know who I was.
"Well, my mum, like, I don't even..."
I don't know how to talk to her.
"You know, I don't have that connection."
"I'm telling you, this son of a bitch killed her, this Mike."
"I begged her to tell me, but she refused."
His last name's not in the book.
This is gonna be very helpful.
So it's not a suicide.
This girl was murdered.
-You read how she was gonna quit drugs?
-Thank you for giving us the diary.
-You have leads?
"-Yeah, we're working on things."
You find this Mike.
He murdered my little girl.
"-You wanted to see me, sir?"
-Yeah.
"I want you to go over to Health Services and take a drug test, officer."
-A drug test?
What for?
WALLENBECK:
For cause.
Lieutenant brought facts to my attention that warrant it.
-l don't get this.
-You have a problem?
"No, sir, absolutely not."
I got nothing to hide.
I would like to know who's spreading rumors about me.
-No one's spreading rumors.
-Health Services expects you.
"-lf you got nothing to hide, not to worry."
"-Yes, sir."
You know where you're going?
Lefrak City?
"Yeah, I know where l'm going."
I'm weird.
I'm going crazy.
Something really does seem weird...
"What's more important, my birthday or training?"
.
"Come on, Bulma-san..."
I've known your dad for how many years now?
"That reminds me, Bulma-san, how old will you be today?"
Ouch.
How rude.
Why would I ever tell you that?
.
"Oh, dear."
Wow.
I've never been on a cruise ship before.
You can tell they're the richest family in the world.
Goku-sa's sure got some great friends.
Is it true that you've prepared a castle and an... aeroplane as prizes for today's bingo contest?
"Yep, that's right."
But the Grand Prize is even better.
"""Grand Prize:"
"Secret"""
"All right, Kuririn."
"With Maron here, that makes three of us."
Let's make sure we go home with that second place castle.
Huh?
You're fine with just the second place prize?
Is second not high enough?
"Oh, I didn't mean it like that..."
"Oh, Goku-sa..."
Why'd you have to go training' at a time like this?
.
Can you please tell me what's really going on?
"Nothing, Joanie."
It was fate.
"If Sophia hadn't sent me packing,"
I never would've met this adorable little equine shrinky-dink.
Those are our vows she's chewing.
Hmm?
"Uh, here."
There.
(sighs)
"Come on, Lemonade."
I'll take you back to the barn.
The trainer was nice enough to take her back.
"Evidently, this happens all the time."
"What she hadn't told me is the minute you take them off the ranch, they lose 40% of their value."
(yips)
Who are you?
This is Tank.
Tank's a Yorkie.
"Oh, my goodness."
"Hello, Tank."
I'm John.
"I was thinking about what you said, honey, and-and maybe this isn't about a horse; maybe this is about you struggling with Sophia getting older."
And so I got you a pet that's gonna stay little forever.
"Oh, thanks, Joanie."
"You're so welcome, sweetheart."
I love you.
"- (growls, barks) - (gasps)"
Seriously?
Bitches love me.
Did you get me a prostitute?
"- No, he's a dancer."
He really likes you and John.
I can tell.
Think he looks at y'all like you're some kind of heroes or something.
"Well, we're..."
We're far from that.
"You might want to tell him that then, if you know what I mean."
I've got a little girl in there who needs her daddy.
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV.
I read nonfiction.
"Well, hey."
Hey.
"Hey, John, what do you say we head back?"
"Oh, no, come on, guys."
The night is young.
Y'all want some cookies?
We all do.
"No, we wouldn't dare try."
Very serious meal.
They're in here.
I got to go pee.
Pee off the porch.
Yeah.
Shit.
"You know, Dale..."
This whole case is our problem.
"I mean, what I'm saying is, you can be as involved, or uninvolved, in the actual apprehension of these guys as you want."
Assuming they show up.
"Well, if they do, I'll be there."
You got a nice spot here.
"Nice house, nice family."
You're a lucky guy.
A...a non-Italian target?
"So, what are we talking about?"
A...a non-Italian target?
That would be my guess.
That would be my guess.
"How reliable is this informer of yours, Cruickshank?"
"How reliable is this informer of yours, Cruickshank?"
He did also say that he saw Ray Chuck
He did also say that he saw Ray Chuck at a petrol station last week.

"Yes, sir!"
"Something to surprise the men and shock the women, or vice-versa!"
How strange.
It's 20 past.
It's just that in Spain we aren't as punctual as you.
But are you sure about what you're saying?
Yes.
"He was speaking with Himmler, I'm sure of it."
"He said: ""Dank, Heinrich"" and hung up."
And he's accepted everything.
We'll call the Ministry.
They will know what's going on in Montserrat.
"No, we're outside Spanish territory."
Our cell phones don't work here.
We'd have to return to Irun and there's no time.
But Amelia and her team are in this time.
We could get off and call from the station.
You're right.
I'm going to get off.
No.
They could call for you at any moment.
It would be suspicious if you weren't here.
I'll take care of it.
"But where do you think you are, Ramblas street market?"
Montserrat is a spiritual retreat.

"Well, not too well, truthfully."
"Actually, if I'm honest, things have gone to shit."
I want to know when!
Years ago?
Months ago?
Weeks ago?
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex.
I swear.
He was just so desperate.
He needed someone.
He needed comforting.
So you slept with him?
"Just so we're perfectly clear, you and Ben had sex?"
And he's been trying to make me feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!
And you didn't tell me?
You just let me feel bad about it?
You let me agonize over that one stupid mistake when the two of you did something just as bad!
Or even worse!
What did I ever do to you that you did this to me?
Were you ever going to tell me?
"I mean, if you did this just to get back at me for breaking up with me I think you'd want me to know."
"Geez, Alice."
That's really low.
Henry!
"Pick me up at seven, okay?"
Seven.
I got it.
I'll be there.
What?
You're gonna go through with this?
"Oh, yeah."
Game on.
Hi.
"Kiddo, we did it!"
What is this idiot babbling about?
"Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?"
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!

It appears that I was mistaken.

[Grimsby] A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
[Eric] We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"[Grimsby] Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."

Oh.
Oh.

This matter is now in session.
The Honorable Rosten Keller presiding.
"Oh, here we go."
"The Estate of Ryan Larson, et al, versus Borns Technology."
"Parties are present, Your Honor."
Be seated.
Ahem.
This matter is here for a status hearing.
"I'm looking at the file, but I see very little progress."
I don't like that.
"Well, Your Honor, we've been conducting depositions"
- and taking testimony--
- No.
They've been doing depositions.
"In fact, from where I sit, you've done next to nothing since we last convened other than show up at my house uninvited."
I was thinking a 99 Euro show.
Do you want something with style or do you want to be cheap?
Who'd pay me that?
Doesn't 99 sound better than 100?
In the supermarket sure...
"But for your event, 99 sounds as stupid as 100."
Sitting up there in his hotel suite and dreaming of the whole wide world...
How much do you think I earn in this place?
Definitely more than we do in our hotel.
"That's your fault, my dear Alfons."
"Just to settle it, Toni's 500 Euro show."
And that's exactly the amount I want for each night.
You've got to be kidding.
Yes Franz?
I just wanted to check up on you.
I'm doing fine.
Are you alone?
No.
How come?
What is all this here?
Who is that?
That's my brother Franz.
Franz this is Max.
Can we talk for a moment Babette?
No.
- Would you leave please?
Why?
Why should I?
Listen this isn't the right time.
Okay?
Who the hell are you?
I don't even know you.
- [Chuckling]
"Oh, I find it fascinating, especially that you have a family business."
It all looks so fun.
"Oh, it can be."
"I guess most days we're either having fun,"
- or ready to strangle one another.
- [Laughing]
- [Overlapping dialog] - [Laughing]
Were you interested in carpets as a child?
- Well...
"- Oh, I think he came out the womb"
- with a book of swatches.
"- No, stop that."
"No, now, when we first got started, it wasn't about carpets,"
I just wanted a family business.
I just came to love carpets.
- Oh.
"- So, what are you doing in Denver?"
"Uh... um, my flight had a layover, and then it was canceled, and, uh, I was out, um, following my sons who are DJs."
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.
"Uh, they're names are Logan and Cody."
They call themselves the Loco Twins.
"Which I guess, in Spanish, means crazy."
[Laughing]
"Uh, maybe you know them?"
"Um, I don't think so."
Oh.
"Well, they opened for the Chemical Brothers."
"Oh, I think I heard of them."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- They're very well respected.
Guys!
Guys!
I'm a fucking genius.
"I know, but look at that painting."
Holy shit!
I know.
"I mean, the camera sees my work before I do it."
It's just incredible.
I don't have to be blocked anymore!
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS) I'm in.
(CHUCKLES) Yes!
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
(HOWLS)
(SIGHS)
(GLASS CLINKS)
You're up early.
What time is it?
How about we start with what year is it?
"Oh, so you can write in a dead man's journal, but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?"
"This isn't poetry, Jasper,"
I'm making our to-do list.
"If we're really going through with this, we need to start making it look like Mr. B's still around."
"I mean, this is actually happening?"
"What are you talking about, bro?"
It already happened.
It's done.
"Well, I mean, we could just not go through with it."
"Actually, I think we have to."
"If I understand this correctly, this is how it works."
The camera spits out a photo of us in the future.
"Look, I keep telling you, I haven't got a girl."
- What's she like?
"- Oh, about 40."
I thought you said she was a girl.
- I wasn't referring to her age.
- Eh?
Oh.
Poor Henry.
"It never rains but it pours, hmm?"
I've never seen her before.
It's a lie.
- What?
- Whatever she says I've done.
- Oughtn't you go and find out?
"- Yes, I jolly well will."
And be careful.
You might fall.
- Good evening.
Did you want me?
- I'm sorry to come like this.
"I know you've done something dreadful, too, but you needn't pay a penny."
- What are you talking about?
- That beastly Dennis.
"Come here, will you?"
...and there were magazines on Sonny MacGregor and a lady called Ransom.
"Now I've nothing to lose, I'm going to expose everything."
- To whom?
- To the police.
You may have nothing to lose but other people have.
"- You don't want to pay him, do you?"
- I have my reputation to think of.
I can't discuss this with you here.
Get your rear end in here.
"Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!"
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!
"Yes, I know."
"""Fred. "" Fred, thank you."
He knows my name.
He knows my name!
"Looking good, Freddie!"
"Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!"
We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.
You saying he doesn't have headlights?
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!
"Well, you know, racecars don't need headlights, because the track is always lit."
"Yeah, well, so is my brother, but he still needs headlights."
"- Ladies and gentlemen,"
- Lightning McQueen!
Free Bird!
"You know, the Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment team ran a great race today."
"And remember, with a little Rust-eze..."
"And an insane amount of luck, ...you too, can look like me."
Ka-chow.
"- Hey, kid."
- We love ya.
And we're looking forward to another great year.
Just like this year!
Not on your life.
- Don't drive like my brother!
"- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!"
- Cathet...
- Pressure's up to 95 palp.
No gross blood.
Where do you need me?
- We're all set.
- She's good.
"Thanks, Sam."
We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a good whack in the head.
We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
"Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers."
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine.
Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No.
The next step is for me to take her home.
"My wife is not crazy, okay?"
She had an accident.
It happens.
"I'd rather she chose to stay, than have psychiatry put her on forced hold."
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
I have to sent you to jail for one day.
Immediate execution.
"Your Honour, are you kidding me?"
"Your Honour, can you give me face?"
Hubby.
Are you kidding me?
"Your Honour, for what we've just heard, should we forget them too?"
"Since the statement is against legal procedure,"
"Jury, you should forget everything you've just heard."
Chan Mon-gut will be represented by Wu Man.
"Tomorrow, the final address should be presented."
Court.
Brother Foon.
Miss Shui.
Why are you here?
I come to save you.
"Alright, I'll pack up first."
I just want to prove your personality.
I am right.
You are a gutless coward.
What?
"If you leave like this, you will be sinful forever."
You can't live peacefully and you'd hide up for the rest of your life.
You would be a criminal forever.
I have decided to stay.
That's why I love you.
Creep!
"Ho Foon, someone comes to visit you."
Miss Shui.
Where did you cut your hair?
"Number 9, Nathan Road."
"Cut the crap, I won't go."
- lf you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon !
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- lt's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
We're passing ships.
We've met a few times.
You were on tour somewhere and we...
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one time I don't remember.
"No, I don't."
Yeah.
It was a crazy night.
LAUGHTER
"Ten past one, Rob!"
I've had similar experiences with Ronnie Corbett where the two of us are smashed off our tits.
Literally no memory of what time we left the golf club.
So it seems silly to ask you if you're a party girl.
Don't you try to deny it!
Slightly retired.
I'm a country bumpkin now.
You moved to the country.
Is that a real thing?
It's not like a stage!
It's real.
I've got a veggie patch and everything.
A veggie patch?
"It's not a euphemism, Noel."
So you're out in the country and you're acting more now.
I am.
Is that as big a thing as the music?
I think music's my first love.
I couldn't ever not do music.
"But acting, yeah, totally."
Love it.
I nearly wanted you.
"I understand that, and thank you."
Yeah.
"So, uh, what's the plan?"
"Well, 7 AM we leave from here-"
"- Riley, no."
Stop.
He's not part of the crew.
Didn't my sister tell you?
You're not in.
"I understand that, Connor."
"I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned."
No.
This is exactly my problem with you.
You're problem with me?
"You want me to take care of this, boss?"
Step back.
You just tell me to step back?
Don't tell me to step back.
I'll step back if I want.
"I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to."
"You know what my problem is with you, Ollie?"
Your lack of respect.
That's my problem with you.
"I, I respect you."
No you don't.
You don't trust me.
Never have.
Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice.
That's not helping.
You're not helpin'.
Where'd you get this guy?
I told you to play dead.
She called me 'Robin darling'!
"Oh dear, so intimate!"
Robin darling!
Can't take this!
"""Guest..."""
"Your Excellency, take a seat please!"
Where's the 'Beast'?
You think I really hid it in the toothbrush?
You hid it in the toothbrush?
"Yes, but I moved it after the burglar show up."
Then why were you so agitated?
I meant to set a trap to catch the burglar.
But didn't succeed!
I'll go to the bank tomorrow.
And get it back for you from the safe!
Go and have an early night!
Plumbing system of the Police Station.
This Formula is only a phoney one.
I think you'd better find Yoyo first.
"Your Excellency, you knew I'd come."
"That's why you didn't lock the door, right?"
Yoyo!
You still remember my name?
Yoyo!
You're the same Yoyo of 3 years ago.
You shouldn't even talk about it.
"3 years ago, poor Yoyo waited for someone at the station."
Yoyo!
He waited and waited...
Yoyo!
He didn't move an inch in case she came.
Yoyo!
"It's one who sets the table, prepares a meal or teaches in a certain way."
"- You're an artist, isn't she?"
- Thank you.
Why didn't you use the Limoges?
May I serve you?
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.
"We go to all this trouble, and Rose and I don't eat very much."
- Really?
- Mmm.
I've always thought she had a very healthy appetite.
I can't stand women who eat two bites and say they're full.
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.
Can I have some?
And potatoes.
Mmm-mmm.
You don't need them.
Have you ever sat in on one of your daughter's classes?
- Rose!
- What?
That's the best part.
- Rose tells me you've never been married.
- Mom.
"That's all right, Rose."
"That's correct, Mrs. Morgan."
I guess I haven't found the right girl.
"I've had relationships that haven't worked out, but that will change."
Really?
Why?
"As I told Rose,"
I have a theory about love and sex.
Did you book this room in advance?
What do you think?
Did you push me into the lift on purpose?
"I just wanted to get to know you better, because you're the most popular girl in our company, ... but no one's ever dated you."
Please excuse me.
"Are you angry with me, princess?"
No!
Don't!
No!
I've got to have you.
I'll take them off myself.
I don't want you to laugh at what you see.
I'm not sexy.
Don't worry.
We're in a hotel room on the 32nd floor.
"If an earthquake hits, we'll die together."
I'm scared.
Moan more.
Is it nice?
Move your hips more.
Hold me tighter.
Shall we go to that hotel that has a revolving bed next?
"Yeah, I've always wanted to go there,"
You know how sexy your voice sounded?
"I liked it,"
Are you comparing me with someone?
Who?
Look at the TV.
- Come on.
Just look.
- l don't want to.
Nami's pussy's sucking my penis in.
"Big CostabiIe, a seniorworker, close to retirement."
Big CostabiIe and little CostabiIe?
"It's ourpatron saint's name, they're not related."
"- You're from the ""nor-d""?"
"- No, from the ""north""."
"I don't know where ""nor-d"" is."
A coffee to welcome you?
Is drinking coffee all you do here?
I've had 3 already!
To work!
"Bye, doll, see you later."
hello to everyone.
Shut yourmouth oryou'II be catchin' files.
Good morning.
"Maria FIageIIo, insured mail and financial services."
"- You're late, it's 9."
- We always open at 9.
You take life easy here.
- would you show me my office?
- Of course.
"What's the difference between ""nor-d"" and ""north""?"
A guy tries to be polite!
"I can tell right off, this guy's a nice person, you can see by his ears."
During office hours let's dress appropriately.
He means me.
This guy wants us to sweat blood.
You'II see.
- Who brought Maria here?
- I don't know.
You forgot your snack.
"I'm 35, and you still bring me snacks?"
"Wait, take a little mozzarella."
Everything's near a beach.
"- Okay, then Tallahassee it is."
- Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure?
Is this... what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
(Crow caws)
You have somewhere to be?
"We can mark watches, take turns sleeping."
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
Charming... my husband... he used to wake me.
"When I cried out, he'd light a candle."
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um... why don't you try... to sleep?
And so what if they laugh?
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me.
"And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared."
- I'm not scared!
"- Yes you are, Violet."
"You don't trust anyone, or anything.."
You never did.
I trusted you!
What?
I said I trusted you!
When did you stop?
The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back!
That's just perfect then.
Why?
Because now you don't have anything at all.
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.
"Say it again, if you have the guts."
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cut it off bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.
My landlady was coming up the street.
I was just... just messin' with her.
Never shot a gun before.
- How was it?
- What do you aim on for some new shoes now?
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!
- Make me!
- I just did!
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where they're shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.
I left him.
- Poor guy.
- He messed up.
- Stupid guy.
"- I like to think I'm the easy-going type but, well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't Forget to Give My Love To Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"- So, where are you heading?"
- Patagonia.
- Travelling light.
- Mm-hm.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you, so..."
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"- I don't have any whisky, actually."
- Thanks.
- Be right back.
"Uh, Ms. McCabe, I have to go."
Thank you for your time.
[Gasps]
"Damn it, Alexis."
You're just like your old man.
You can't leave things alone.
Are you going to kill me?
What?
Why would you say that?
"Oh, I don't know."
Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.
"Alexis, I would never hurt you."
This isn't what you think.
"What the hell is your game, Hayley?"
"Believe me, you don't want to know."
Neither does your father.
Why not?
It's complicated.
Jordan Keegan?
We need to talk.
About what?
"Well, your name came up in a homicide."
This is the murder weapon.
It's a prop from a movie that you wrote.
So?
"So, did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?"
Perhaps two?
"One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles?"
What are you guys talking about?
"We're talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher."
And also I'd like us a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.
"It'd be nice to have like a white, beautiful place and a decent stove."
It's not a lot to ask.
"Wow, don't look so surprised."
Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
You know what's funny?
I don't think I ever cooked for a guy before.
I mean not even my husband.
Jesus Christ.
Where is he?
Who?
You know who.
- Trevor.
- Don't.
"Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?"
"This, Ivan."
"He's your ex, isn't he?"
What?
Why is he doing this?
"It's because I'm fucking you, isn't it?"
Now it all makes sense.
"I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me."
Where is he?
"Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?"
"I don't know what you are talking about, baby."
"Ah, don't baby me."
"Yeah, baby."
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
"I'll do anything you want, baby."
"You know what, I don't deserve this."
What did you do?
I humbly ask you to tend to your children with love.
Deign to see the pain and suffering of my friend and those like him.
"Chun-su, what are you doing?"
!
They'll take everything away anyway.
I'd rather bum it myself.
I'm going to destroy everything and follow my friend.
Chun-su!
Please tend to my father's grave.
He's burned everything!
Who's next?
First old man Yim then his son Chun-su: who's next?
Say something!
Are you mute?
"Don't get involved, Father."
"Hush up, boy?"
Old man Yim was like family to us.
But we just let them take him.
"Heck, we didn't even go to his funeral because we were afraid!"
What do we have except our friends?
"If we lowly peasants don't stick together, who are we to trust and depend on?"
Who goes there!
"Soon-shin, I'm here for you!"
It's me.
Yim Chun-su!
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
"It's me, Yim Chun-su!"
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
What are you waiting for?
Stop this man!
I think... cleaning's overrated.
There's still hot food down there to eat.
There's something really truthful about this waiting... and doing the whole job at once.
"We're gonna use up all the dishes, and then it's time to clean."
So you want to talk about it?
Not really.
Hallie call?
No.
Call her?
And say what?
I haven't done anything.
I do.
I'm not a housewife.
And I found fleas in the bedroom.
You mean my pets?
"I think fleas are people, too."
And... they should be treated as such.
Those are my pets.
And you're going to kill them?
Are you a murderess?
"Seven, what do you think I should do?"
Be honest.
"Well, I've been honest."
Not with Hallie.
With yourself.
"Sorry, babe."
I cannot give you any more advice on this one.
Just take mine!
And you put on... your...
"You know, if Vanessa has a problem with it she should clean that (bleep) up."
"Hey, it's Dale."
"Listen, Hallie, why don't you just call me back, please."
Where's his mom?
- What type of mask?
"- Uh, round, like a baby."
Okay.
What do you see next?
[Laughter]
Fire.
"They were grilling lamb, and, uh, people were cheering."
[Rossi] All right.
It was a Greek restaurant.
"Baby, me and gyros?"
"- No, thanks."
- What?
- I'm gonna go check out this Mexican food.
"- Oh, baby, no."
"Baby, I'll be right back."
- All right.
- Stay there.
- I'm gonna come and get you.
- All right.
"[Rossi] Now, do you remember anyone in the crowd, anyone that didn't fit in?"
[Kiersten] No.
"But to be honest, I was already looking at the menu."
"All right, that's good."
"Now, don't look up from the menu."
Just listen to me.
"Now, when you love someone and they step away, there's an instinctive response to glance up to make sure that they're still there."
"Now, you did that last night, even if you don't remember."
Okay.
You're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what I'm getting.
I'm getting the gyros.
See what they say.
- I don't have time.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.
"If you catch me younger, I make you a hero."
It's a very rare film.
Not a common brand.
Imported.
I don't think many people around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
But I want the photos of their cadavers.
From the autopsy.
I have a family.
I have to put food on the table.
Does your family know what you do?
My family thinks I'm the next Truman Capote.
He's an American writer.
Never mind.
Find out.
"I've seen your partner too, but I don't remember where."
Do you know if he ever worked in Vallecas?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden in the car.
We found this in the glove compartment of your car.
"What's going on, Rodrigo?"
"Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?"
Mm-hm.
Hungry.
Adam?
"Do you want to go in and spend some time with your dad, and say goodbye to him?"
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Someone's just died.
You're not supposed to.
Adam hasn't just lost his dad.
He's lost his food supply.
He's going to have to feed again soon.
"Oh, my God."
- Where is he?
- Out.
"Oh, no."
Peaches)
You were a teenage boy once.
You know what they do.
"- Yeah, wank at any opportunity."
"- Well, that's helpful."
"Well, no, there's other stuff, but none of it really registers."
"# Well, there goes a girl and a half"
#She's got me going up and down
#She's got me going up and down... #
Dollar!
#...
Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches
"# Well, I got the notion, girl"
# That you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
"#Spread it all over my peeling skin, baby"
# That feels real good
#All this skirt lapping up the sun
Thank goodness. I'm famished.
I forgot to have lunch today.
Make sure you get double cheese.
And get some of those little tomatoes daddy likes.
- Daddy can't be disturbed!
- What?
He's lying down upstairs.
"Here, get a large."
"Graham, what happened?"
is it Andy?
Nothing happened.
Do you feel all right?
Are you coming down... I just want to lie here.
How was your meeting with Rosenfeld?
It went okay.
Did you feel like you made all your points?
"Look. I want to tell you, and I will tell you how the meeting went... but I really just can't talk about it, now!"
Okay?
You know it's okay.
We'll live.
"You know I mean... we don't have to have this account, I mean the important thing is... I'm really sorry."
I have to get out of here.
- What?
- l can't breathe.
Graham!
"If you didn't land this account, that's okay."
Please!
"J ust let it be, okay?"
- l can't...
- You can't what?
What is wrong?
- Where are you going?
How long have you known my mother?
About a year.
How did you meet her?
We just kind of met.
Are you going to see her again?
I hope so.
Would you like that?
I guess so.
"Hey, you wanna know a secret?"
What?
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?
Made me realise what a wonderful mother I had.
You will realise that too some day.
What's that?
Monster ride.
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What's that mean?
"Well, a route is a road you take when you're on a long journey."
Can we go in?
"Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother."
What for?
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Ride here if you dare!
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Look like someone had a bad crack up.
"Fill her up, cowboy."
"We wouldn't be eating in there anytime soon, Nicolas?"
"Eww, look at that."
You should close your eyes.
Jesus!
"- Boy, this is one heck of a ride."
"What did you say, hysterical?"
Who?
Hello?
Hello!
It was me.
"I know, when my... husband behaves well, then I become a beast."
"I lose control, become inexplicable."
"I was sure that it was Gianni again, but I did not have... any inclination to speak nor to listen."
"Love, I tell you something:"
my cock is hard.
"Can you hear, beloved?"
I thought about it and I got a hard-on.
-That's the way it is!
-Who is talking?
-You are not Teresa.
"-Of course not, I am Rosella."
"So what, I have a hard-on."
So what can I do about that?
-Lend us a hand.
-Who allows you of using me?
"Sorry, I continued to believe you were Teresa."
"But I told you, I am Rosella."
"This is just as well, give me a hand, it is good."
What hand?
I do not understand.
"A hand, just a hand."
Indeed!
But you must pretend that my hand is yours.
-You are crazy!
"-Please, don't hang up."
I could not forget that voice.
It's sensuality prevented me.
He is free!
You came when I called to you.
I am free and you will sacrifice your bodies to me.
Come.
"You say nothing, but you speak to me with your minds."
"I will give you all my power, so that you may carry out your revenge."
You may go.
Now I am within you.
You have all of my power until sunrise.
"Once the daylight comes, you will be just as weak as you were before."
Go now.
You only have a few hours to carry out your revenge.
They're alive.
I saw them.
Poor things
"So, Louise, who did you see?"
Tell us what you know.
I didn't see anyone.
But I do know everything that happened.
That's the way I am.
I know things I have never seen!
I've heard about your gift of second sight.
Are they alive
- They're alive.
- Where are they?
Right here.
"- No, Bosco!"
- Calm down!
"Captain, stop him!"
"So there you are, my children."
You are very much as I imagined.
"Yes, I've seen you before."
Get in.
Where did you go?
"Hey, where did he go?"
Go inside.
Where did Kutty go?
Come here.
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
To pluck guavas.
There are only stones for 12 kms.
Where did you get the guavas?
Tell me the truth.
Where did you go?
I won't tell you.
Tell me.
I won't tell you.
Small boy!
Don't you fear me now?
Konda Reddy says that Singamuthu is in this quarry.
And is insulting me with a camera.
This bastard says that he went to pluck guavas.
Don't you have any fear?
"Until he tells me where he went, he must lie there bleeding."
"If anyone tries to save his life without my knowledge, your children's fate will be very much similar to his."
This is Cuddapah Raja's line of death.
"If anyone treads on it, I will kill him."
"Kutty, where did he go?"
He didn't come for lunch either.
He can't stay hungry.
"Kutty, come fast."
We might miss the bus.
Someone tell me where he is.
"It would go great with cocktails or, uh, for a snack or on crackers or to make small sandwiches."
"- Even those, uh, ""ooh-doovas."""
-What?
- Hors d'oeuvres.
-Huh?
Hors d'oeuvres!
"They'd be good for that, too!"
"Here, just taste this."
- Just taste it.
"-No, no, no, I'd better not, Kramden."
I'm on a very strict diet.
No.
How can this harm you?
"It's homemade, pal."
- Here.
Take a little bit.
- Well. ..
"just one, if it's homemade."
Hey.
This is very good.
What did I tell you?
L-I've never tasted anything like it before.
"Everybody that tastes it says the same thing, Mr. Marshall."
- This'll be a riot.
-Yeah.
"Well, I want to try it on someone else."
"Oh, Ms. Evans, please tell Mr. Peck I'd like to see him in here for a moment."
"Mr. Tebbits, too."
"Kramden, this appetizer has possibilities."
"If it's handled right, it can be a big thing."
"Now, tell me, is this your wife's exclusive recipe or could there some..."
"be someone else involved, like, uh..."
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She's coming with us.
Eh!
Eh!
We have to do something.
"Yes, but in due time."
How can you be so calm?
"If you would be so kind, tell me the joke about the Spanish hell."
What are you doing here?
Thinking about how to get out.
Wait!
Wait.
Get me out of here.
I have an even more important secret for Himmler.
"Here inside there is a time door, only one."
I can show you hundreds.
Traitor.
(WHISPERS) You have no idea.
"I hate to disappoint you, but the Holy Grail isn't in Montserrat."
"Our only grail is our Blessed Virgin and our custom, to kiss her."
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
Tell him that I hope he enjoys his cyanide.
You speak German.
-I studied in Tübingen.
"Look, I know that I can't prohibit you from treading this holy ground but I can confine myself to my cell until you leave here."
Take care not to break anything.
Should we fear God's wrath?
-No.
You should fear mine.
Heil Hitler.
Fräulein Lola Mendieta.
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
This isn't going much like the picture by...
"Yea, I know."
"204, 00:18:15,886 -- 00:18:18,094 I wish it would be more like a normal job."
Now it's weird!
"206, 00:18:20,016 -- 00:18:21,882 I never really talked to a job before."
Listen...this might be some kind of a test.
Everything is a test when you're a career woman.
Damn right .
And thoses dresses aren't going to buy themselves.
I got it!
What?
I know what we can do!
What?
"Why don't we just go in there, blast him without thinking about it ?"
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"214, 00:18:40,911 -- 00:18:43,654 We don't even have to look either because we never going to miss at that distance."
"That's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
You think so?
Totally!
Cool.
But don't aim too high.
Why not?
We don't want to hit that little bird.
"Oh, yea, good thinking."
"Okay, ready?"
Ready!
Let's do it!
Who wants a snack?
"Be careful, they're hot."
It'll soften the blow.
It doesn't matter what I do.
He is never going to forgive me.
Of course he will.
You're his only daughter.
He has to.
"Congratulations, by the way."
- Thank you.
- How's it going?
Good.
Good.
"Okay, talk to your father soon, please, because I need your help on Saturday with the Novack wedding."
They want five additional cakes.
Cakes.
Mom-- mom!
Mom.
What?
"You don't even ask anymore, you just assume?"
What if I have plans?
Do you?
- That's not the point.
- What's the point?
That I could have.
What time Saturday?
8:00 a.m.
I love you.
I don't know how to tell him.
"Honey, ever since you could crawl, you've been out to prove a point-- that you could do whatever your brothers could do, only you could do it better."
"And you've always been way too smart, except where it comes to your father."
You're 30 years old.
When are you gonna stop looking for his approval?
I thought we were going out.
So I was very happy to only photograph...
"His trousers, his boots, the sidewalk, and this car."
"I really liked that, and..."
Also what I liked was...
"To blur the whole picture, except the upper outline."
What's that?
It's beautiful.
It's a sunrise on Fès.
I went to Fès in April...
"And people told me ""Did you take pictures?"
"!"""
"I say ""Sure, here's a great sunrise on Fès""!"
And I show them...
And they're a little bit surprised...
"It is Fès, that's obvious..."
Fès is here...
"There's the brightness of a lamp, but..."
"No, it's not a lamp..."
There's Fès...
And there's some brightness...
Those two things together can make a picture...
Can make a picture...!
Two heterogenous things can make a picture together...
Like a sunrise in Fès.
I seduced someone with this picture.
I send it to him...
He fell in love instantly with the picture...
He's also a photographer.
"He felt close to it, especially for this."
The end.
That's all.
I want to thank (...) For their help.
I hear Harrington Woolen Mills got some government contracts for military uniform cloth.
A lot of people will move here.
Which way is it to Harrington Mills?
Follow Elm Street to the river then look up to your right.
You'll hate it.
"- Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"- Morning, Nellie."
Paul left this morning.
- Left for where?
- Don't know.
Says he wants to leave town and make something of himself.
Instead of working all the time at the mill.
- He wants to see the world.
- Who is?
Paul.
He left town this morning.
"Allison, must you play records so early?"
Good breakfast music.
Digest your juice with culture.
"I'm glad about Paul, Nellie."
How did Selena take it?
She's glad too.
But she ain't a mother.
Neither are you.
I'd like to see the world.
Have a romance in Venice.
Meet a tall stranger in Hong Kong.
"- Allison, don't eat so fast."
- Have to.
Senior class is giving a gift to Ms. Thornton.
I wrote a speech that Rodney Harrington's going to read.
"- Badly, I'm sure."
"Look, there's a hotel across the road there."
"We could grab a room, really thrash this thing out."
(Laughs) It's not gonna happen.
No?
"Come on, well, why do you call?"
Why do you...
Why do you keep dropping in?
"Fine, I won't."
"No, I'm not saying that."
I'm just saying why?
Why?
I don't know.
And I can't stay.
"Oh, well, this has been a cracker day for me."
I'm only trying to get an innocent man off murder charges.
"I'm happy for the distraction, yeah."
I thought everyone you defended was guilty.
Do you remember that long weekend we spent together?
"Yeah, yes."
Son Of Astor paid for it.
Came in ten to one.
"I had you for four beautiful days, all to myself."
In the Margaret River.
"And I really slept there, didn't I?"
"Yes, you did."
"Yeah, it was pretty much all you did, actually."
Snuggled up and snoozed.
I didn't mind.
They had in-house porn.
Call me anytime.
It's looking a bit messy.
"Ah, Sal."
Yes.
Good morning.
Nozu Good morning.
"Hey, the performance in Tengeki looks like it's set."
Oh really?
Kayama-sensei is there.
Oh?
He's driving a bus.
Why?
What happened?
He can't dance.
He hurt his foot in the war.
"You know, his right foot."
Your feet are your career.
What's happened?
This was so sudden.
"He was such a good teacher, but everyone's forgotten about him."
I wonder what goes through his mind when he's driving his bus.
When my father was a student he lived at my mother's house and they supported him.
He was a hard-working and honest scholar back then.
He was blessed in many ways.
"Your mother was dancing ballet then, wasn't she?"
It's a strange combination.
It sure is.
Especially since my mother likes someone else.
Really?
My mother has been seeing someone since she was in her twenties.
But she had children with my father - me and my sister.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'd like you to put another cheque in for me.
Certainly.
- Please.
"Rick, please, I didn't mean to start anything like this."
Please just let me hold you.
You need to sleep.
"Lil, I'll call you."
It'll be okay. lt will.
You wouldn't want to be a flower girl.
[Zoe] How would you know?
You're supposed to look like a robot who marches up the aisle dropping rose petals.
- What's wrong with that?
- l'm so glad you're not making this complete spectacle with this wedding.
"What if you have two flower girls, me and Jessie?"
Mom?
- Mom.
- lt's okay.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'll tell you later.
"Mom, are you okay?"
[whispering] No.
"No, honey, I'm not, but I will be."
"Oh, Mom."
I'm okay.
"- [woman] Karen Sammler's here,"
"- Oh, great."
"Oh, uh, how you doing?"
[stammering] I want you to know how much I appreciate this.
- l'm not doing this for you.
- l didn't mean...
- lt's for my clients.
- Of course.
And I need something from you in return.
I didn't know you engage in back-scratching.
Eden of the East.
Hirasawa-san... users always complain about the system being down.
Don't let it get to you.
sweat and snot!
Leave the snot out!
what do we do now that we can't help Takkun?
I have a suggestion! why don't we change our HQ's location?
To where?
I set up our room at the university as a fallback.
The old Eden System is still in there.
that settles it.
What better place to save Vintage's butt.
Agreed.
It's from Saki!
I'm heading to the airport now.
Takizawa-kun is returning to Japan.
What the heck?
I'm afraid your journey ends here.
Hey...
What's this mean?
No. 01's launching a missile?
I need to know No. 01's target.
launch the remaining missiles.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that your plan to destroy and rebuild leaves you as our strongest savior.
Now I'm gone?
Juiz.
Juiz?
Did Mononobe-san manage to locate Juiz and launch missiles at her?
my request is still being carried out too.
Mononobe-san.
"Marcus Zerbib, you know him?"
He wasn't a friend.
You two were in business.
Some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago.
The guys he snitched on would fill the phone book.
"But only you could gun him down in cold blood, during a leave from jail."
Would I waste him when I have 2 weeks left to do?
"What's wrong, Leo?"
"- Nothing, why?"
- Don't kid me.
"You're lost, I can tell."
"I'm in deep shit, and I can't discuss it."
Not even with me?
Not even with you.
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.
HQ's finest cop.
"We met at ""Swann's"""
"at 1 AM, we chewed the fat till 5 AM, then he dropped me at my hotel."
OK?
His name?
Vrinks.
I'll need your boys.
What for?
We located the van gang.
How'd you get the tip?
Know a man called Silien?
Why?
Says he was with you when Zerbib died.
"If he says so, must be true."
Could I have that in writing?
Investigating murders now?
You're scaring me.
So..?
"Dear, I don't feel a thing."
Wait.
This is the danger.
The effect kicks in when you least expect it.
"You know, I'm discovering the US."
What surprising people.
They're clean and crystalline...
They believe that Christ is always on the side of the winner.
- May I say something?
- Yes.
I'm starting to feel the effect.
Are you joking?
- Is it strong?
"- Yes, I can't take it anymore."
"It's been so long, Curzio!"
You're the only person that calls me Curzio.
"Careful, she's looking this way."
Is she crazy?
My god!
"- My god, that woman is crazy!"
- She's nothing but trouble!
Don't tell me she flew that plane all the way from Washington.
"Sicíly, but I don't doubt she'd manage it."
She had her wings before she sprouted tits.
- Maam...
- Thank you.
"I'm General Howes, representantive of General Cork..."
"Major Beckwith, General Cork's assistant."
"The General would love to be here personally, maam, but duty calls."
At least someone's fighting the war.
"He tried to kill me, and I killed him first."
But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison!
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"-Hi, Ted."
"-Hi, Allison."
"Mr. Partridge, I can testify about Lucas."
I saw him beat her.
"It will help, believe me."
We appreciate you coming for the trial.
-You're going to get her off?
-We're going to do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing:
evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
we have a murder and a defense that's too simple to be good.
It's open to attack from many sides.
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry!
There's no more to tell.
"Yeah, I'll take the dress shop before, okay?"
"Hello, Allison."
-You look well.
-With the drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"-You haven't learned, have you?"
"-Oh, yes, I have, mother."
I learned to smoke and drink.
"""To each according to his needs""."
My poor little thing.
Is it love?
My cub...
Love.
I'll show you.
Mommy!
The smell is the proof.
You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age.
Especially when they're incontinent.
"Here I am, my friend."
"Come on, get down here, you prick."
Do you want me to snatch you by the balls?
Jump off!
And don't fidget!
"Do you remember when, you told me that"
I am doing all this for Mary.
You were right.
"Do you know what a ""lost girl"" means in French?"
Nobody knows any more.
It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart.
You can never help her.
Ever.
You can try to kill yourself.
That's all.
"Yeah, I know."
"You could tell me that I could have nabbed the Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa..."
I'm not God.
I'm just holding his crayon.
That's all.
"one more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home."
Come on.
"I mean, it was his flute that..."
You've the filthiest mouth!
"Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?"
I'm being harassed!
You just move!
"Look, do you want to keep it?"
What do you mean?
Do you want to...
He wants to know do you want an abortion?
I do not!
There's no way I'm having an abortion!
"Good, you're right!"
You definitely won't tell us who it is?
No!
Sorry.
"Well, there's no more to be said, is there?"
She's obviously made her mind up.
A man needs a pint after all that.
Hang on a second.
"Yes, love?"
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's a terrible... the neighbors!
Do you care what the neighbors think?
"Yes, I do."
"Sure, the O'Neill young ones are after having kids."
The pair of them.
And the Bells would be the same... except they don't have any daughters... but you know what I mean.
Tara O'Neill had her baby for Paddy Bell.
Of course she did.
So fuck the neighbors.
"You coming for a drink, Sharon?"
This is...
But we won't go there!
"We were looking round - the great and the good of Leeds - and from the galleries high up, someone yelled down - can I do this?"
"they said, ""Northern Whiteley, you fat BLEEP! """
"""Where's Carol? "" One of the prisoners accompanying us said,"
"""That's Jed up there what cried down at you."
"""He's a real hero in this prison. """
"I said, ""Why, what's he done?"
"How many people has he killed? """
"He said, ""He were the lad what nicked your car two years ago!"""
LAUGHTER
I want to play a game with you.
This Countdown thing.
This rearranging letters.
Yes.
What do you reckon?
Any ideas on that one?
"I'm short-sighted, thank goodness!"
"Tell you what, we've got some here."
What do you think that might be?
"Mini, Mini."
Mini?
You're absolutely right.
It's mini.
What about sexul?
Sexul?
Gary Lineker's got one.
Nothing sexy about him or it.
Got to be a Lexus.
He's right.
That's two.
They're getting harder now.
"Hmm, I see that you've been looking at the papers again."
Mm-hmm.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Okay.
Don't freak.
I got mugged today.
You got mugged?
!
"Not freaking, remember?"
I think someone's after the papers.
How do you know that?
Just tell me what happened.
"All right, since Mom couldn't help you with the encryption,"
I went to see Dad today.
Yeah?
He said that there might be something in the time capsule that could help me decode the papers.
Really.
It's--
It's under the bed.
Hello?
(Leo on phone) Angela.
"Hey, Leo."
I've been researching our artist.
He's got no money troubles.
No history of illicit or suspicious dealings.
He's clean.
Except for the fact that he was lying about something
"(Leo) Yeah, but what?"
Maybe it's time to have another conversation with Mr. Walker.
"I've already thought of that, but he's not answering his phone."
"I guess we're just gonna have to pay him a visit, then."
All right.
- Is it a conspiracy?
- I have not even heard coming.
- I opened it.
- Come in the living room?
- I was going in the kitchen.
Idiot.
He has the courage André.
He loves me.
I am sure that I prefer my mother.
"If I'm with him, is to recite better in the theater, you understand."
Forbid you to judge.
You have confused ideas to do this.
Finally.
All right.
It's clean!
"So, enlightened, ports reports of Mickey Marie?"
- I do not know where they are ...
- You are as Marie.
Put it where the Chiappe.
I told you that I would found.
He is my dog.
My brother of sugar.
He knows the future.
"Your future we'll leave, but this leaves me!"
"Marie has paid his return ticket, is the price."
The trip was a surprise and this is priceless.
So no cheating with your whistle.
Do not you know far more to be a man?
Shut up you.
"I Don't trust you, Albert."
The good Lord has addressed if one tries not to understand ...
"Hit, Albert ..."
"Sir, I..."
Listen...
"Sir, listen..."
"- Step outside, Mansley."
- Yes.
(YELLING) You realize how much hardware I brought out here?
You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's dollars out of your butt!
"I gotta admit, I'm relieved that this is what Hogarth was talking about."
(LAUGHS)
"I mean, I was beginning to, um, think it was real. (LAUGHS)"
- (DEAN CHUCKLES AND CLEARS THROAT)
"- I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it."
"But, uh, do you need all this stuff on the surface?"
"Well, um, no, actually."
(STUTTERING) It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.
"You know, not as thought-out as this other piece."
- You like that one?
- Yeah.
(THE GENERAL YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
You'll be chief inspector of subway toilets by the time I'm finished with you!
"Now, pack up."
I'll expect you back in Washington to clear out your office.
MANSLEY:
"Yes, sir."
Hmm.
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.
"You mean, you know about that?"
(LAUGHS) Aw.
Now I do.
(ENGINE REVVING)
"Bye, Kent, and all that that implies."
Cool!
I like fat black girls.
I can't believe this cruise doesn't have cocktail sauce.
"Finish your breakfast, Rallo!"
"Hey, Junior."
Huh?
"All right, pirates, in one hour we board the cruise ship to rape, pillage and plunder."
PIRATES:
Yay!
"And maybe this time, a little less raping."
"I think with the last boat, we all got a wee bit carried away."
"We're better than that, you guys."
"I never thought I'd say this, but if I have to eat one more friggin' shrimp"
I'm gonna kill myself.
I got one!
(flapping like a fish)
"Okay, okay, stop it!"
"Oh, my goodness, a talking whale!"
I'm not a talking wha...
"Oh, come on, that's... that's mean."
"What mysteries of the deep have you come to tell me, o sea monster?"
"Junior, it's me."
Your dad.
Daddy!
"""Dad,"" 14. ""Dad."""
"Listen, we're in a heap of trouble."
Somali pirates are about to take over the ship unless we stop them.
Where's your mother?
She's dead.
"Oh, right."
Where's Donna?
(funk music playing)
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
John!
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
$%#!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
John?
You wouldn't listen!
I told you to tell him!
Keep your pants on!
"All right, boys, break it up!"
"The other eye, Nelson!"
Close the other eye!
"Ten seconds, Stoke!"
Get in your shell!
Cover up!
Cover up!
"Break it up, break it up!"
Go to your corners!
"Break it up, the bell rang!"
- What's got into him?
- He's got to make it look good!
"Yeah, yeah!"
"But we finish him the next heat, don't we?"
"Yeah, the next heat!"
"Here you are, get your fresh-roasted peanuts!"
"Get all the peanuts you need right now, folks!"
There's not many left!
"I told you to get in a shell, didn't I?"
You see his face when I gave him that right?
- He'll murder you now!
"Won't he, Tiny?"
- Red's got something!
- What do you mean?
- Play it smart!
"Keep away from him, and you'll go the distance!"
My only chance is to deck him!
It's better to go the distance than get your head knocked off!
Get your cold beer here!
"Sawthe-thestem,ifyouwill,  or the shaft of the arrow."
And you think that's the King's Mark?

-What they call the King's Mark?
"Yeah, no mistake."

Itwaslateradopted by the British government andusedto mark government property.
Butwhywould a Broad Arrow carving appear ata sitebelieved to have been established bymembers of the Knights Templar?

All the way up.
Okay.
All stop.
"If it's a King's Mark, legitimately, thenI thinkwhereIwouldgo at this point would be:"

And that demands further research.
- Welcome to the surface.
"-Thanks, guys."
So you saw the feed on from the camera up there?
-Yeah.
-We did.
But I need a firsthand account here.
What'd you see?
"She's definitely, um..."
That's not a flat bottom down there.
"There is hard, large rocks on the bottom."
And I'm guessing...
-Not flat though?
"-No, no, not flat."
But there is a lot of debris down there.
-Sure.
"If there's any problems with that, let us know."
I'd like to interview each of you individually.
Who wants to go first?

Nice tits!
He had a lightweight jones going and got popped.
He's coming up to Folsom.
I want him in with us.
Can he take care of himself?
"He don't know nothing, but I'll be responsible for him."
You know what you're doing?
How you doing on the tecato side?
"I'm clean now, ese."
Thank you for helping us get this meeting together.
"Yeah, I'd do anything for my carnal."
"When you come up, if you need anything, let us know."

"Going slow, homes."
- Nine-Nine!
"- Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"- Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
- You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
"- Sorry, I was making a video for my son."
"You know, in case I never see him again."
Do you not do that for your kids?
- Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
"You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now."
"Hey--hey, girls."
"It's me, Daddy."
"If you're seeing this, I'm dead."
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
"- Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian."
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
"- Yeah, yeah, lullaby time."
Look.

- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Good call.
Blocking the door.
"Keep it up, smorty-pants."
- Oh--
- Uh--
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
- He's a good man.
- But this is tough stuff.
This is body bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There's isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I got to go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface just as I knew when that bullet hit that boy it would keep traveling.
And find its way...
To me.
If only it had found me first.
It is not the way of a lust people !
"How could you lie to me, you butcher !"
How could you make me love you ?
I did not give you permission to leave !
She doesn't need anyone's permission.
Let her go !
Enough of this childishness !
Throw them in the slave pits !
Wait!
These are only lemon sharks!
This is all part of the course.
It is like life.
Like in relationships.
They will not attack unless they feel attacked!
"Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do!"
Don't let them see your fear.
"Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move."
What was that?
What?
What was that?
"Jason, stop..."
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!
"Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!"
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns' and it's time to shoot some fish!
"Here on Eden, there are no guns!"
You got an American life at stake.
One life is not more important than another.
What do I do?
My friends and my wife left me to die.
"You must get out of the chum, but slowly."
Okay.
Swim slowly out of the chum!
Slowly.
Slowly.
"Yes, yes."
"Slowly, baby!"
She doesn't want to see me anymore
And i don't want to see her either.
"Look, i'm not gonna keep arguing with you about this."
"Michelle, you need to fix it."
- You don't need to keep...
- You need her.
Don't need to keep what?
"Hi, regina."
So what do i owe to this displeasure?
You know what?
I told you this wasn't a good idea.
See?
"I'm sorry to bother you, regina,"
May we please come in for a second?
We will not stay long.
I promise.
"Well, my day couldn't get any worse."
Come on in.
Get going.
so i brought michelle here
Because i think we all have some things we need to clear up.
Michelle told me what happened and...
And i'm sure she gave you
Her twisted version of things.
"Look, regina, i am tired of you disrespecting me."
"First i'm stupid, now i'm twisted?"
- You know what?
Let's go.
"- First, regina..."
Shh-Tch!
"First, regina,"
I want to apologize for any misunderstandings
What if I wake up?
Shan.
Believe it.
OK.
Come on.
Are they...?
They're wolves.
"Tom, they're wolves."
All this time.
It was wolves.
- My beast isn't a beast at all.
- How can there be wolves?
They've been extinct in Britain for years.
Maybe people just think they died out.
"Maybe they've been here all the time, surviving without anyone knowing."
"Right, you ready, Kyle?"
Sleeping animals are a lot easier to film than angry snarling ones.
Turns out The Beast wasn't a beast at all.
"Thought to be extinct in this country, these two wolves... have survived."
Their existence a secret for years... until I found them.
"Not a bad night's work, eh?"
They're waking up.
You should let them go now.
Why would I do that?
"Give us a hand, Steve."
What are you doing?
"I'm not going to leave them here for someone else to find, am I?"
So you're keeping them?
"As what, some sort of trophy?"
For now.
Then I'll sell them off to a zoo or something.
Why?
- You'll put in a word for me?
"- Look, you're on top brass's radar, and CID have nothing but good things to say about you, so just bide your time, be patient."
- I'm not very good at that.
"- No, I'd noticed."
In the meantime...
"Clifford Bentley's brief's kicking up a stink, saying I hit him during his arrest."
"Now, someone might want to ask you some questions about that, so er..."
"- You didn't touch him, sarge."
- Yeah.
"That's how I remember it, an' all."
"- Now, back into Comms, Tennison."
"- Yes, sarge."

Very seasonable.
"- Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful."
- Listen here.
Remember that comet I was telling you about?
The blooming thing didn't hit us after all.
- You know why?
- No.
Why?
"Because it knew at this moment, across the park Sir Emery is going to announce the marriage of his daughter to the very man you're talking to."
- Dr. Jekyll!
And my best wishes to the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.
Thank you.
You don't mind if I hurry?
"- Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll."
"- Thank you, Mr. Weller!"
Oh.
Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is.

Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his lvy as I know he'd like to.
As his lvy thinks of him.
Because he's an angel.
Here's to my angel.
Surprised?
Couldn't be that you didn't expect to see me?
No.
I've been...
I've been waiting for you.
But you've been celebrating.
And you know it.
"You see, that's where you're wrong, mr."
Enright.
"So, what are you saying?"
You going to do a better job than the world-famous lapd?
If any of these crime scene photos would have shown

Yes.
Watch this.

That's her again.

"Yes, as a matter of fact we are."
"We're doing what we came to los angeles to do, captain."
Then you know you're wasting your time.
That's called clean police work.
Are you suggesting I'm not clean?
"I guess we're about to find out, captain."
"I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me."
I think you're about her size.
Could you try it on?
I'll wait in the other room.
Got the bullets.
You'll be surprised how many places I...
What's goin' on?
How do I look?
Ok.

He gave it to me.
What for?
"I don't know, Vi."
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have you lost your mind?
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!
I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about.
It's not about the fucking dress!
"- Yea, right."
- That's exactly right!
"You don't run me, Violet!"
We don't know anybody.
or get involved in stuff or anything like that.
I never went to a prom.
"You did, but I didn't."
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?
Because that's what they do if you're different.
"Everybody isn't like that, Vi."

But you were right.

It was Lex.

"But without that photo, we can't prove anything."
- What about the key?
- I X-rayed the mansion.
It's nowhere to be found.
- Jimmy and Lois?
Where are they?
- I don't know.
And I'm worried.
"The last I heard, they were leaving the Daily Planet."
If whoever attacked me
- followed the photo from there to here...
- He may have stopped them from leaving the building.
I got to go.
"If Lex has both of those keys, not only will he discover your secret, but he'll have complete power over you."

"Anyway Sir, Shall we finish the work,"
Sorry Sir!
"Don't get me wrong, I am in hurry."
"I have to finish one more job,"
Mean?
"After finish my job, you'll go to finish for another job."
"Sometimes, I have to finish 5-6 jobs, I am kind of busy for 24 hours."
Marveles!
"Learn some, learn some, learn some thing from him."
Learn!
Learn!
"Excuse me, Sir!"
"Excuse me, Sir!"
Learn!
You beat us every time to the front of anyone.
I've never chosen my own company.
"Nyssa, it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father."
"And, Tegan, it's your own curiosity that got you into this."
"And Adric, a stowaway."
-The Tardis!
-It's followed us from the Central Register.
-How can it get here when there's no one in it?
-Did I say there was no one in it?
It must be the man who brought me to Logopolis...
I don't want any further argument.
"One, two, three of you into the Tardis."
Quickly.
Go on.
"-Look, we want to help you..."
-It's impossible.
My friend in there will look after you.
I'm collaborating with the Master.
"Now, go on."
-Battle stations.
-The man's a murderer.
"Come on, Nyssa, he means it."
-Together?
-One last hope.
"So far, nothing but jungle:"
"How about you, Wilma?"
Picking up anything on infrascan?
"Negative, Buck:"
Just appears to be another out-of-the-way planet that time forgot:
"Uh, shouldn't Dr:"
Goodfellow have some information for us by now?
I'll check:
"You should go to Alexanderplatz, this is no place for trading."
"Do you wanna go to another pub, Franz?"
Please?
Stay calm.
Just wait and see!
Buy this really genuine piece!
Why does the wealthy man in the west wear a bow and the yobbo doesn't?
Ladies and gentlemen!
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Come closer!
Guys do you want me to sing the tie song?
Maybe Mr Biederkopf will now sing something for us.
"Alright, alright."
What could we sing?
"Band, what tunes can you play?"
"How about... ""Ich hatte einen Kameraden""?"
Who do you think we are?
A new pub for Mr Biberkopf.
What's up?
"The Mister seeks a new pub, this one isn't swell enough."
- Get off the table!
- Says who?
Me!
I'll pay for the glasses.
"Well Biberkopf, there was no need to terrify my customers."
"Come on Cilly, I know what's going on here."
- Let's go this way!
"- No, we go this way."
"Come on please, let's go this way."
- No!
We'll go this way.
"Come on, let's go!"
Never mind.
"Mr. Rickman, can you hear me?"
"Now, don't move."
Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.
Thanks.
"Please, let this be a dream."
"I want a dozen double-stuffed Oreos, IV push... ready with 1,000 milligrams of peanut butter crackers and two amps of Nestle's Quik."
Good afternoon.
Hello.
My name is Christine Draper.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Sally Druse.
Are you a good doctor?
As good as Dr. Hook?
No problem there.
Your hand's acting up?
Yeah.
Needles and pins.
And I need it for my pendulum.
I'm psychic.
I've been written up in several magazines.
Patient complains of needles and pins.
Noodles and prunes.
He's got one hell of a blood puddle in there.
I'm surprised the blow didn't crack his skull wide open.
"First, we open our craniotomy and then we excavate the haematoma."
"Capisci, Elmer?"
Yeah.
"Okay, there it is, Elmer."
I always pause here and imagine that I am the first neurosurgeon.
The first to boldly journey into the workings of a human mind.
Cool.
"I'll be looking for you in the destroyed fields, Bishop."
"Ok Kix, since you have so much energy tonight  why do not you take the first guard?"
Have fun with your book.
Mara!
"Come on, Bishop."
"Get up, Spartan."
There is something in the trees.
I'll send you back to hell!
Yellow-eyed devil!
Bishop...
"I've marked it, Commander."
I marked it clearly for you.
"Bishop, I'm here."
Did you miss the fucking shot?
10 meters away?
"You are the total ruin, man."
Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer?
I would be a damned commander!
And my team would still be alive!
"Now it's your turn, Bishop."
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot  bye, son of a bitch!"
"Listen, or you'll never pull the trigger again."
You do not have the eggs.
Reckless bitch!
"Mara, they were wrong."
There is life in the area of death.
I will not resign.
"I will not stop, Before we find our daughter."
You are with me my love
You're here with me now.
Ash!
"Come on, my friend."
Wonderful.
Great.
Um...
"So, a little bit about me."
"Uh, my service is called"
"""Goldilocks and the Three Dates."""
Katy...
I forgot to tell her not to tell you that.
"So, I've modeled my business after the charming story that it's inspired by."
"I send my clients on three dates, and like the beds that Goldilocks laid down in after eating the three bears' porridge, maybe one is ""too hard,"""
"and maybe one is ""too soft."""
But in the end we hope that maybe one is just right.
- Katy...
- Get after it.
You're losin' him.
Okay.
"Wayne, why don't you just tell me a little bit about yourself."
It's impolite to talk about yourself.
Keeps his truck clean.
Loves his dogs.
Enjoys a beer and a smoke.
Beer...
Beer and smoke.
That's...
"Wow, you know."
I get it.
Rustic.
"Trucks, got it."
We will make this work.
"I love it, okay."
"And then, um, Wayne, can you just tell me a little bit about your past relationship?"
You shouldn't air your dirty laundry.
Just pass me the bill.
Okay!
Sir Wong is looking for you.
What's wrong with you?
You used my money to solve a kidnap case.
You saved the guy but my money is gone.
Now my money is strewn all over the streets.
Isn't that too much?
Capturing the baddies at all cost.
"Bro, you think I'm the richest man in HK?"
"I'm not your bro, Mr. Mak."
I'm your son.
Are there other cops like you?
Using money to work?
You're too busy to spend your money.
Treat it as a good cause.
You think I'm a charity?
Fine...
You only call when I spend your money.
Meet and scold me in person.
Isn't that more satisfying?
I'm always free to meet you.
I never wanted you to be a cop.
"I warn you, I'll freeze your account."
Excuse me...
Where's the resource room?
You can't buy style.
Shit!
We've the same tie!
"I asked for resource room, not fashion advice."
"No resource room, evidence room is ahead."
Thank you.
You've seen that old knife Eric always has?
Maybe.
"Certainly, as far as weapons go, it's worthless."
"When I look at him, I wonder why is he trying to survive as long as he can?"
I have a feeling I might understand.
There's no need to ask.
The job of the hunter is not to protect.
But he exists to protect someone.
Who are you trying to protect by going after him?
Good Lord.
The coffee's gone ice cold.
I'm a silly old fool.
Forgive me for going on like that.
"How about a cup, young lady?"
"My special blend's pretty good, you know."
Go on.
It will do you good.
"Stop calling me ""young lady."""
The name's Makoto.
"All right, fair enough."
"As long as you promise not to call me a boring, old cont."
What is that?
I have no idea!
What is it?
Why all the ruckus?
MAN:
Mandurugo.
"Mandurugo, what are they?"
Winged vampires native to the Philippines.
Aim for the heart!
Make each shot count!
These silver bullets aren't cheap!
"Hey, Pastor, do you know that... some of these ruins are well over 2000 years old?"
"Yes, but in Philly we have the Liberty Bell."
"Malaparte, tomorrow I'll see the Pope."
There's one thing I want to know:
What is his favorite sport?
I don't know.
But maybe he plays baseball.
Very good!
"Cameras, move forward!"
"You know, there's something sad about victory."
Each goes his own way and nobody knows... when we'll meet again.
"Sometimes, when they do know, they hide."
"Not us, I hope."
Let's set a date to meet... after the war in Capri.
"You know, it's all set between Maria Concetta and I."
She goes to Cleveland with me.
We'll go to Capri first.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
"I believe you, Jimmy."
"No, you don't believe me."
"You'll see, I'll be back..."
- Malaparte!
- General!
What are those monuments over there?
Tombs.
Tombs of ancient Rome nobility.
Whose?
That's General Silla's.
That's Cicerus'.
That's Julius Caesar's.
- Julius Caesar?
- Yes.
The retrovirus is acting quickly.
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other Wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects, if you bring her back alive."
But I doubt she'll cooperate.
She's also stronger and faster than any Wraith I've ever seen.
Great!
All this time.
We thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us.
And I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Zaddik's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you!
"Dr Beckett can make you better, but you have to come with us."
We will not hurt you!
She took a blow to the head when Ellia hit her.
Stay with her.
- Sheppard!
- That's an order!
Teyla.
Drop the weapon!
It's over!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me!
"Trevor, you don't want to do this."
Let me help you or you're gonna die.
You help me?
"Yeah, right!"
I know about Preston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
You damn half-breed!
You don't know anything!
"Trevor, we pulled your phone records."
You called Preston 13 times today.
So what?
!
"We pulled his voicemail messages, too."
"He's using you, kid."
That's why he won't call you back.
Get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
Listen to me.
Just listen.
"When those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?"
It was your man Preston.
And he got it for nothing.
You're a liar!
All you people do is you lie!
"The men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job."
They just couldn't prove it.
So now they're doing life.
"Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!"
New Bern is on its way.
There are 70... maybe 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
"All right, let's get ready!"
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location through the satellite.
"Well, can they?"
"If they have time, yes."
Do you know who it is?
"My guess is, it's, uh, Valente."
"What, him?"
"From, uh..."
from Homeland Security?
"I don't know who he's working for now, but he told Sarah to get the bomb any way she could and to eliminate all witnesses."
All the witnesses.
Shut it down.
"No, I can't."
We just have to make sure we disconnect the feed before he finishes the trace.
Hey.
I don't get it.
Why are they just standing there?
I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
Agreeing to have sex with someone you haven't even met.
"Grace, what's going on?"
Where are you?
"Uh, at a hair salon."
"In fact, I-I have to go."
Bye.
"- It's Neil, right?"
"- Yes, Neil."
"Oh, he is gorgeous."
"Strong chin, warm eyes."
Whew.
I can almost taste him.
Adriana never sent anyone to meet me before.
Why now?
"Oh, it's just something we do for our most valued clients to ensure you have the most enjoyable experience."
I'm flattered.
"So give me a sense of what you're looking for, and how you envision your night with Neil."
Do you mean like the perfect date?
Sure.
Let's start there.
I want to fall in love.
It's not just about the sex.
It's about the before.
And the after.
"Lying there in messy sheets, drinking him in while he tells charming stories."
Running fingers through his hair as he soaks in a steaming hot bath.
You know.
Yes.
I think I do.
"This one, Adriana says is one of her best."
So I hear.
Neil.
Take a shower.
They're gonna be here soon.
You need to clean the grill.
"Why can't we just stay in, just the two of us, and just not do that?"
"You mean like when I'm up and I am doing things, and you're asleep?"
Let's save that for another afternoon.
Get up.
The joke's on you.
I'm not a ventriloquist dummy.
- That's all right.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- You could use that in your act.
- I could.
You want cheese?
- Cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger.
- It's funny.
Can I do it?
Do you mind if I...?
I just don't need everybody touching my cheese.
Just...
No.
This will be mine.
- I'll have cheese.
No cheese for this guy.
- I can't have dairy.
I'm taking this cooking class where we're learning how to make a curry carrot corn queso.
It's like a dip.
"It's for Christmas and couples, or you can put it on salad."
- Was it sponsored by the letter C?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're welcome.
Is that your car stuck there?
We're waiting for a tractor to pull it out.
"I see, thank you very much."
I'd really like to repay you somehow.
- Don't worry about it.
- But still.
It was really nothing.
Let's go.
- Thank you for your help!
- You're welcome.
Get her keys.
"We're just gonna grab some stuff and then we're gone, all right?"
"hey, hey, hey."
Come on.
Army food.
Yum.
- Which one's the key to the boat?
- The red one.
Let's get out of here before I start puking again.
"Look, look, I won't tell anybody you were here."
Just take the boat and go.
Please.
"Actually, we don't really need this."
I'm gonna find them.
The people who did this are not gonna get away.
Just tell me she's gonna be all right.
"She lost a lot of blood, but her pulse is strong."
We just have to keep watching her.
Bad heart valve.
She's had it since she was born.
"You didn't believe in me, and you still don't."
one shouldn't be crawling on all fours like a worm.
My star!
"Venom is a bit scrunched, but still alive!"
Reliable sources blame the Armenians!
A bit skittish they are now.
Venom was probably dealing with some big Turkeys!
That's more honorable!
"Mickey Micheyan sewed the shit, now he has to drink it."
"They're assholes, those kids."
"It's the moon, Mercury."
"Mickey, he's a marked man."
The stars are my thing.
You've got the jitters?
Wanna split?
There's a door behind.
I couldn't.
- Because of her?
- Yes.
What's her ass got that mine hasn't?
She's fragile.
That's all in your head.
And your head is here.
"You, the slut!"
"And you, the missionary, you wait long before you get it!"
Here they come!
My comrades...
"It's not the same syndicate, commissioner."
It's private here.
"It's not them, detective."
The landlord assured me they've been here since 9.
"Oh, I know these guys."
-Not with 10.2 million euro.
-Solenergi is the new oil.
They are doing groundbreaking research on nanocrystals.
They are close by cracking fourth generation code.
-It have I heard that before.
-I think it's worth checking.
"Leong, have I ever disappointed you?"
-I will send Degang.
"-No, I will go myself."
-I speak the language after all.
-Do you speak Norwegian?
"Yeah, I was born there."
-You have never told me.
You never asked.
All right.
Send me the numbers.
"And if I like them, you go in."
Do whatever you Vikings do.
-The press is waiting downstairs.
-Good.
I just want to coordinate a little with you first.
"I want us to tell them that we are dealing with new opportunities,  and we are optimistic."
"""Opportunities""?"
What the hell are you talking about?
You should not dictate what to say.
You do not get me juge.
"Of course not, Svein."
People are afraid. 300 men need to know what happens.
I know.
But I want them to find out from me.
Not read about it in the newspaper.
I beg you.
Here comes Mrs Ellis and that Mrs Turner.
Here's your chance.
Try and sell them something extra.
Let's see a bit of salesmanship.
She's as bad.
She'd pass you on the street.
They're no good once they've been to Majorca.
Brown.
All she thinks about is being brown.
"And nearly everywhere, if you believe what he says next door."
"Well, who's got a better view?"
"20 Navy Cut, please."
"Same for me, Granville."
And a box of matches?
(HE MOUTHS)
Too much sun dries the skin.
It's very destructive.
-
- I go blotchy.
-
- She'll wish she'd kept more clothes on.
"And here, where me bra finishes, it always starts to peel."
It's further down where it gets me.
I can stand hardly any exposure round me navel.
Me skin goes all crisp.
Top of me thighs is where I get it.
"It's the ultra--violet, according to that friend of our Edmund."
He should know.
He's as big a violet as I've ever seen!
-
- How is your Edmund?
-
I swear.
Lance Crawford?
Mom!
"Hello, Eric."
Your father and I were just discussing... how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
"It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation. [Laughing]
- I'll get some sodas.
"- No, please."
Allow me.
Why don't you stay here and chat with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.
"Yes, I'd love to explain the practical impossibility... of the so-called light saber."
You son of a bi-
"Red alert, you guys."
Red alert!
Lance Crawford is in the building!
- I'm gettin' the hell outta here!
"- [Jackie] Wait, wait, wait."
- What if he sees us sneaking out?
"- Oh, Donna... leave one of your socks behind."
[Groans]
What?
It'll distract him.
"Nina, I thought we were so happy together."
What happened?
"Fez, right now I'm at a point in-"
"Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker."
I want the truth!
"Okay, the truth is you're too needy."
Too needy?
"I'm sorry, but a man in his sexual prime has needs."
- She looks mad.
"No, that's just her look."
What's that?
"- ""It looks like her number came up."""
- It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
"You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."""
- I heard about that.
- Everybody heard about it.
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
- This is a classic.
- If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to find the right moment."
"Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown."
I still don't get it.
Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- That was my line, man."
- What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds...
Ask the captain.
"- This is a crime scene, for god sakes."
"- No, you heard me."
You know what?
He must've heard me.
"It's okay, look."
I don't know about not telling Emma.
If I don't...
What if Miguel is right?
You said you don't want to stress Emma out.
You let me know if you find anything out.
"Maggie, hold up."
I trust Miguel.
He'll get this sorted out.
"Like deciding not to tell Emma, and then, swapping glances like you're teenage boys"
- getting away with things again?
- That's not what just happened.
"Look, I've raised Emma on my own since you left."
"I've made mistakes, but I didn't have any help."
- That's not fair.
You know I had to leave.
"- Now, you're back, and you think that you and Emma almost being killed"
"No, listen."
I
-Pragmatic.
"No, I did."
"No, you are."
I'm a realist.
-You are scared.
-I'm not afraid.
It is not our first time.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
-OK. -unhappy Himself.
"I'm just very, very unhappy."
You're so...
"You are so wonderful, and you're so..."
"The sensitive and romantic, and..."
So why would he disappear?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?
Did he have money worries?
Did he have marital problems?
"Oh, who doesn't, mate, eh?"
(LAUGHS)
"Oh, who doesn't, mate, eh?"
(LAUGHS)
"Was he a friend of yours, Malcolm?"
"Was he a friend of yours, Malcolm?"
"Oh, me and Don had a lot of respect for each other, yeah."
"Oh, me and Don had a lot of respect for each other, yeah."
Don have any enemies?
Lot of people hate politicians.
Don have any enemies?
Lot of people hate politicians.

Thought you were supposed to be in stir in Pommyland.
I was.
Now I'm back.
I was.
You want to take a swing?
Do it.
Nothing would make me happier.
Just want you to move your truck.
What was I thinking?
"You only beat women, right?"
Listen...
"You're not paying for a double, and even if you... even if you were, it wouldn't include Crazy Horse over there."
That's a whole other deal entirely.
- I'm trying...
- You're not trying hard enough.
"Get rid of him soon, or this doesn't happen."
He left New Haven an hour ago.
He'll be here.
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying."
"No, you're just worrying."
Hmm.
Where else is he going to go
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.
[phone rings]
"Hi, Julia."
I did what you asked.
I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.
Thank you.
"Look, I know how tough this is for you."
Tough?
This is...
This is tough?
"No matter how this goes down, I lose."
"You get that, don't you?"
"If you're right, the father of my son is nothing better than a con man."
You bought stock with a bad check.
That's fraud.
People go to prison for things like that.
Never mind the sermon.
Have you got the check?
Let's talk about a better arrangement.
Alright.
Call your shots.
And so I can.
I'm now your junior partner.
An interest in the business to be mutually agreed on.
What if I say no?
Then you don't get the check.
You've got a deal.
It's lucky the bank teller was a girl I've known for several years.
"You know, a man called Thornston Weblin once said business is the art of getting something for nothing."
Yes?
Hello.
Is Mr. Sabourin here?
"Yes, he is, madam."
I'm Mrs. Ryan.
He's expecting me.
"You know, the only thing I don't like about this painting is the face."
"Oh, well, we'll have the face changed for you."
Hello.
Hello.
This is Miss Howell of the real estate office.
Mrs. Ryan.
How do you do?
What is this all about?
"I'm buying this house, if you approve."
Louis XIV?
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
I want to protect him.
Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm gonna need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
"All photos, now."
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
(LAUGHING) Or what?
You gonna kill me?
Mmm-hmm.
(YELLING IN DISTANCE)
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
We're heading out soon.
Once they've juiced themselves up for the night.

That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(CONTINUES YELLING IN ARABIC)
(GUNSHOTS CONTINUE)

Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
We pay these guys for that?
Okay.
"Now follow- Who is that, Marguerite?"
Follow Marguerite backwards until we see where she got that tray.
Keep going.
Keep going.
'Cause we want to see where that top chip in the far left column came from.
Okay.
Give me the casino angle.
Boom!
Let's see what we got on her.
"And while you're at it, give me Bella Petto, south deck about 11:00."
"Go tight on the topless chick near the middle, in the black bikini bottom."
"She's good, but about 1:30... got two blondes putting oil on each other."
Got it bookmarked.
"Mitch, this is business."
"Just a skosh more professionalism, if you don't mind."
See.
See.
"While you're getting your perv on, this guy's lifting this other dude's wallet."
Freeze it.
Blow it up.
Let's see what we got on him too.
"I'm in a surveillance zone, baby."
What?
I bet 50.
"Holding three clubs, aren't you?"
Fold.
When does the Pussycat Dolls go on?
Fold.
I'll see your 50.
Raise you a hundred.
"- [Knocking, Door Opening]"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Um, are you ready for us yet, Doctor?"
It's...
It's a little after 8:00.
"Zucco work back here, Mr. Morgan?"
When he's not out delivering.
"Hey, come on."
What's all this about?
What about shotgun shells?
Do you carry them?
"Well, years ago."
"Hey, maybe I still got a couple."
You want me to take a look?
"No, no, no."
"We have our man coming down from Explosive, and he'll check it out."
We'll just wait for him.
You mind if I look around down here?
"No, go ahead."
All right.
Thank you.
Here we go again.
So Samuels calls me in his office today.
You know what he wants?
He wants to know if I'm interested in a promotion.
"Well, that's great."
No!
"Now, wait a minute!"
You know what he really is interested in?
"- Well, not necessarily."
"- That's better than being totally ignored, isn't it?"
"[Neva Shouting] Your problems and my problems are so far apart, we can't even talk to each other."
Where is he?
I'm talking to you.
Did you hide him in a hole?
Get out from my house.
Should I go out?
I'll throw you out.
I don't even bury you in the cemetery.
"Captain, come out of your hole"
"I told you get out, he is grieving too."
But you're not grieving.
I'm going to make you grieving;
it could be a relief for these poor people.
Whom are you threatening?
What are you coming to my house for'?
What they are coming to your house for?
Because of their loved ones!
Because of my dear brother!
Let me go Sardar Hossein!
Get off my back!
Leave him alone.
I told him:
"Captain, the sea is stormy!"
Don't go!
"But he didn't listen to anybody, left and killed seven breadwinners_"
You said:
"Captain, how does the sea seem?"
I said:
"I am Captain, not God."
"All of those 7 breadwinners were in need of food, just like me."
Leave him alone.
"Get out, get away!"
I said get out out!
The League of Nations will thank you!
"What I said was, how will I benefit?"
The entire human race will be grateful!
That means I won't benefit at all.
"Oh, there's US$500,000 too!"
"US$500,000?"
We'll share it fifty-fifty.
"For the human race, for the world, I will help you."
Come what may!
What do I have to do?
You have to steal a Formula.
Where from?
From Fat Pig's house!
What?
You want me to steal from my boss!
You want me to lose my job?
I'll get my provident fund in 20 years' time!
"Do you want that in 20 days, you will be enjoying California's sunshine."
Inspector!
What is it?
The Commissioner and his family will be going out tomorrow.
He wants you to tighten up security.
No problem.
Tell him to go in peace.
I will take charge personally.
I'll stand guard tonight.
You come as the burglar.
Then we'll be able to get it.
"Over here, get in."
Hurry!
Yoyo looks great.
Beginning to take after me!
- There go my kidneys as my sides split
- Up.
"- Yeah, like you're the boss of me."
John Mitchell?
Who's asking?
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
"We assumed you'd be keeping a low profile, and then suddenly your name pops up on a job application."
"Bad move, that."
Sloppy.
Who are you?
Oh.
Richard Hargreaves.
"Oh, right, so all this cloak-and-dagger stuff is to sell me a rug, is it?"
Sarcasm.
How unsurprising.
I'm here on behalf of the Old Ones.
"The, er... the vampire elite."
They've entrusted me as their agent.
- Get out!
- Mm-hm.
Is it true how they live?
"All that hardcore Hammer horror shit, avoiding sunlight, and sleeping in coffins and that?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so impertinent as to ask.
"Well, so, this is what all the fuss was about."
"You know, I expected some... demon."
What do I find?
The last Russell Brand in the shop.
With me.
"No, I'm sorry, pal, I'm not going anywhere."
Oh.
"Oh, I think you are."
Chelsea won!
- Chelsea!
Chelsea!
"Neil, Mr. Malhotra's lawyer has sent this fax."
"If Tisha dies, the Malhotra family gets everything."
The Malhotra family.
Lqbal Chand Malhotra?
Kabir Malhotra's brother... who was disowned by their father.
But why?
I guess he must've been the black sheep.
And it's possible that...
"Kabir didn't help him out, so he must be very upset."
What are you looking for?
Any idea how this red paper and these chemicals are connected?
"No, why?"
Mustard has the same effect on me.
Mustard?
Let's go to Mumbai then.
To see Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
I was going to say the same thing.
See you in 15 minutes.
The ward is upstairs.
Mr. Malhotra is asleep now but you can still see him.
How long has he been here?
Five years.
Stomach cancer.
Last stage.
Has he ever left this place in the past five years?
"This is a sanatorium, Ms. Agnihotri."
Not a jail.
Patients are free to move in and out.
"But, as far as I know, Mr. Malhotra never left this place."
I haven't felt that from you in years.
I'm sorry about that.
"Okay, so now, finally,"
Are you guys gonna get back together?
- I don't know.
- Me either.
- I have no clue.
- Me either.
- It's all new to me.
- Me too.
But look at you.
Look at the way you finish each other's sentences.
"Look how upset you were when she didn't call you back,"
And look how you didn't want him to know that you were back.
Look at all of it.
Can't you see?
This is who you are.
You're mom and dad.
"We are, but we're not alan and elaine anymore."
We're alan and elaine.
I'm glad you stopped by.
Me too.
I'll see you on the strolling path?
Until the strolling path.
"Got to hand it to you, David."
You make one hell of a wingman.
"Thanks, dad."
Where are you going?
To get Rita.
I'm not leaving you here alone with that whore.
Inspired by the events that occurred on social networks.
"Come on, I'm your older brother."
Ask me.
"Okay, big brother."
Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
I borrow him myself from time to time..
when I get depressed thinking about..
"world hunger, poverty.."
Not to trivialize your pain.
"Thanks so much, Pheebs."
We are gonna have so much fun!
"Oh, not that kind of fun."
Happy Valentine's!
I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty.
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
Monica got me porn?
Girl-on-girl porn?
!
She really must love me!
"-Yeah, just relax."
"-I love you, St. Valentine."
"Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty."
Now push!
"Right, OK."
Anyone else won't stand for it?
Raise your hand if you won't stand for it.
"That is good to know because we do need to make some redundancies, so you're all fired."
What?
I was stretching!
I will stand for it.
We need to reduce spending pretty urgently.
"I'm afraid it's a case of 'no pain, no grain'."
"Yeah, Prof, the company bought this gold jug for the tournament later."
Mm-hm.
"So we'll need a bit more pain, then."
Sorry.
Let's lose...
the guy with the monobrow and Lena the cleaner.
What?
You can't fire Lena!
Why are you still here?
"End of meeting, everyone back to work."
Apart from those who've been sacked.
You have to go.
Now.
Not even fixed the squeaky door!
"Mmm, fish eggs."
Cor.
Workers united will never be defeated!
The workers united will never be defeated!
"Oh, no, please!"
I'm a worker too!
I'm working very hard here!
Lena's worked here for 45 years.
"So she probably needs a rest, then!"
"Yes, it is."
Hey I'm sorry man I forgot.
You people don't have deserts and this dry heat do take some getting used to.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Mr. Jenkins.
Yeah?
We are busy men.
Me too.
So you do know what we need.
Oh yeah.
Nick you said you have some big stuff you need greased through the boarder.
Yes.
"Well I handle the number three artery into California, the night shift."
I could smuggle through a heard of elephants if I had enough capital.
That's true.
Billy here is the very best.
He's your man.
So what do we move?
So what do we move?
"When the time comes, we'll let you know."
"Sure thing, konnichiwa."
I've been studying.
I might be playing baseball in Tokyo next year.
I'll call you.
"Ok, partner."
All right.
So what do you think?
He was nervous.
"It's a big opportunity, anyone would be."
Are you sure about him?
Absolutely.
What do you need?
--There are no vacancies.
--There are.
--I need a room.
What must I do?
--Give me your passport
--And put a $10 note in the passport?
"--$ No need for the $10 in your passport, citizen."
Then is it $15?
Maybe $20?
"Will you leave on your own, or should I call the police?"
"--Your room key, please --I'm going to the buffet"
The buffet is for the hotel residents only
Why do you all sit on your butts?
"Get up and open the door for me, as you're supposed to"
--Merci!
"Bobylev, this is Vasin."
--Do you live alone?
"--Yes, Pavel Ivanovich"
--May I sleep over at your place?
--With whom?
Hmm...yeah.
Good lad!

You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach!
Get on the ground!
Hold it right there.
Don't move.
Stay down.
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!
"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman."
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque."
Better call Saul.
"Saul Goodman, attorney at law, 505-1 64-CALL."
That's 505-1 64-CALL.
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, no."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
She who?
-Ella.
"-Alvaro, you are a pig."
"No, no. would not to do it."
"It hopes, Lella.?"
To where you go?
I will not return to go to the cinema with you.
Now you lías to slaps with me?
Lella...
-You must learn to respect to me.
"-Yes, Yes, in agreement, hopes..."
"Eh, Casanova, you have returned to give in the morning call?"
"Yes, it aimed at the ass of your sister, jerk."
What you have said?
"It pardons, I have been mistaken."
Lella...
"Oh, my God."
"Eh, boys, I do not hold more, has remained me rigid."

-The sister of whom?
-Of the Left-handed person.
The Left-handed person...
What you need to do is focus on yourself.
Ok?
"So, please, sit."
No.
No?
"This is my therapy, and I should be allowed to decide what we talk about."
"Erica, just drop it."
Ok?
You're not his doctor.
This is not your problem.
"No, because his doctor is mia, and Kai is out there drowning, and you are acting like you don't even care."
You could talk to him.
No.
Yes.
You could get through to him.
You and I are not gonna discuss this any further.
"You know, unlike Dr. Fred,"
I don't become involved in the lives of other patients.
That's a rule?
That's my rule.
Fine.
We are not doing this today.
"Erica, come back."
Open the door.
"Come back and sit down in the chair, please."
Open the door!
Everything ok?
We had a disagreement.
"It wasn't our first, won't be our last."
"Well, disagreements are a normal part of the process."
This was different.
This felt like... the fights that I used to have with Sarah.
Events of major importance happened in Europe today.
"First, this morning, the representatives of Britain, France and..."
[Ursula]:
Do you think Andrea would be a soldier if he were at home?
[Janet]:
Probably.
[Radio]:
Informed by the German government that Germany regarded the Franco-Russian...
We're going to have to go into Truro to get him some clothes.
- I know.
- Who did father go to?
Can't remember.
[Radio]:
By the obligations assumed at the Carno.
"He's so young, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
I think we can eat.
I'll take Andrea's tray up.
Perhaps he might want to try coming downstairs.
"Oh, no."
It's far too early for that.
I hope he's gonna like it.
"They look so sad, don't they?"
Not at all.
Don't eat too quickly.
Hmm?
Doesn't matter.
"It's very filling, isn't it?"
"You don't have to eat it, Ursula."
I'm sure Andrea will eat what you can't manage.
Perhaps I'll eat later.
He might like some of my bottled pears.
Get down now!
- Get on the floor now!
- Get in there!
Get him down!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
"- Come on, Todd, come on!"
- What happened?
"I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over."
"Come on, kid."
Come on!
He's dead.
"Don, he's dead."
CSI:
NY Season05 Episode13 Rush to Judgment
I was questioning him.
"He was getting agitated, then he started talking azy."
Then he started shaking.
Foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
Don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
Detective Flack.
- You mind answering a few questions?
- No problem.
"Don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?"
"No, no, no, no."
I'd rather take care of this now.
"Okay, you can start by filling out this incident report."
When did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
Earlier today.
He was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
Detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
"Sorry, but don't mention that I was here."
You're fleeing?
Or your family will fall apart and you won't be a detective anymore.
They've been hiding for 15 years.
It's like being imprisoned.
"They've already atoned, let them go."
A crime is a crime.
What we did may be a crime to our families.
"Those are our civil affairs, not the police's problem."
"You're impossible, we're finished."
Wait...
But I'm a detective.
"Don't worry about me, I'm sure I'll be out in two years."
So wait for me.
"In two years, come pick me up at prison."
Open up!
We'll be okay.
What're you doing?
Hurry and open up!
Where's Suzuki San?
"Last I saw, she was delivering sushi."
Wasn't that a while ago?
"Room 405, right?"
I'll go check on her.
"Hello, front desk."
Mind coming up?
Is something wrong?
"Just come up, hurry."
"Alright Betty, time for a walk."
Like you're digging deep.
Sir?
You're becoming the earth...
You have no principles.
You're just like us.
"And you're selfish, too."
"You've gone nuts, haven't you?"
Just eat your fish.
"Moonsook, you have a lovely face."
Thank you.
My face is rather big.
Wish I could cut some off.
"No, you have a lovely face."
"You're drunk already, aren't you?"
"Yeah, a little bit."
"Moonsook, what makes you sad?"
"My father, maybe."
We don't see each other anymore.
Her father is a famous composer.
He's written many well-known songs.
"Now, I hate him the most."
But I'm also very sorry about it.
He's given me so much love.
"Every weekend, he'd take only me on his travels."
"He was like an octopus, wrapping me from behind in that closed grip, squeezing me and not letting go."
He worries about me more than I do myself.
But does that make sense?
It makes my skin crawl.
That's why she studied abroad.
To run away from him.
"Hey, you crying?"
Need this?
No thanks.
My tears are clean.
I have a question.
It was her evening gown Gina didn't want the messenger to see.
"And, in the normal course of events,"
Danny would have been suspected of the murder.
But things are never normal when little--
"Hey, look at the new dress."
Della picked it out.
"Oh, I did not."
Isn't she pretty?
Sure is.
How about a date?
"Merle, I think you owe these people a very, very large encomium."
"What for, Julian?"
Well-- thanks.
For saving your life.
"Oh, I was going to give them all a big kiss for that, silly."
"Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc."
"Burbank, CA"
"Now, you may not be the man I want, but don't make me kill you."
Turn around slow.
You John Tyree?
I am.
You and this country have already cost me a good horse.
Which one?
"You got your mind set on it, we'd better find out."
"One more thing, though."
I didn't kill the marshal.
Know that!
I didn't kill him.
I won't try to prove it.
Only the man in Texas.
"All right, where?"
Would you like to speak to Mrs. Brown?
"Oh, no, no."
Don't disturb her.
I'll just leave these with you.
"What is it, Ellen?"
"It's Mr. Skinner, ma'am."
Harold!
What a surprise.
You're just in time for dinner.
"Oh, no, thanks."
"Well, I owe you a meal."
"Remember, you bought my lunch a few weeks ago, under pressure."
"Well, thanks."
I've eaten.
"I had an appointment with John,"
But he seems to have forgotten all...
"Well, come in."
I can't imagine John getting his appointments so mixed up.
"Darling, your act was absolutely priceless!"
Darling?
Mmm?
What are we going to do about John?
Do you have to worry about that now?
"Well, let's face it."
We're running out of ways to meet.
We can't pull this one again.
Ellen will be suspicious.
"And if I take you to lunch once more,"
John is going to start asking questions.
"Yes, I know."
Have you talked to him about bringing out the new line of modern stuff?
He won't discuss it.
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
- Oh!
- You shot him!
- Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
- It was.
It was awesome.
"It was actually just like the end of ""Speed,"""
which is a pretty good movie.
"It's not as good as ""Die Hard."" ""Die Hard""'s perfect."
"- Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
"- Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis."
"Same page, still."
- Get out of the car!
- Young Jeezy take the wheel!
"- Freeze, punk!"
"- Yeah, freeze, punk!"
"- Gina, where did you get that gun?"
- Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.
"- Hey, Figgis."
"My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you,"
I should read you this letter.
"""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby."""
"Oh, that side's for me."
"""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy."""
"- We're sorry we doubted you, sir."
You really saved our butts.
- I can't take credit for that.
-What a fool you are!
What a fool!
-You are alive. I'll tearthem to pieces.
To pieces!
-What a fool!
Alive!
-Sucker!
-What's wrong?
-Windbag!
"- Calm down, everything is all right."
Get lost!
I do not want to see you here again.
"-Listen, why did not you shoot?"
- l was not going to.
-He must think I'm dead.
- lt's one ofthe tricks ofthis trade.
What's that?
"-Did you summon me, comrade mayor?"
-Yes I did.
The talk is to remain between you and me only.
The Malyutin company is to be reinforced with experienced soldiers
"- but there remained veryfew ofthem, right?"
"-Yes, sir."
So you'll augment the companywith the ones who have already been sentenced.
- ls everything clearto you?
"-Yes, everything is clear."
-But I do not have the right to fulfil your order.
- Theywill be sent on a mission that will nicely replace a firing squad.
"You know perfectlywell, Sergei Pavlovich, who can give me such orders..."
Damn the rules!
"You have changed a lot recently, comrade mayor!"
I'm sending my best soldiers out to this mission
Jesus Christ!
"Hold on, darling."
"911, there's been an accident."
Yes.
You okay?
"You didn't see it, did you?"
Seewhat?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
John.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
"According to the doctor, it's extremely rare."
"600,000 gets this thing."
Did they say it was a result ofthe accident?
"No, it turns out... that it's been there a while."
There's nothing else they can do?
"No, no."
"They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out."
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car and the universe... just points at you and says...
"""Ah, there you are, a happy couple."
I've been looking for you.
"I've been looking for you""."
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
-You got change of 20?
"-Oh, yes, sir."
What's your number again?
-82.
-82.
I put your number ahead of the other guys.
"-Thank you, sir."
-I like the way you work.
"All right, let me look at that robe a minute, will you?"
"Get this polished while you're down there, too."
"This may be a little gaudy for the Waldorf, but in certain sections of Manila, may I tell you...?"
"Hey, look, kid, uh, where's the latri-- uh, the shower?"
"Right over there, sir."
"Be a little indecent, showering alone."
You're all right.
-Did I get your number?
-82.
"Yeah, all right."
"Oh, I want this suit pressed."
I want those creases you can cut butter with.
I'll do it right away.
"Wait, hold it, this is the important..."
See these stripes?
"When you steam it, don't get 'em up."
You know what I mean?
-Keep 'em nice and shiny.
-I certainly w...
Six stripes?
"Well, you're a master sergeant."
How do you know?
Were you in the service?
"Oh, yes, sir, I was a lieutenant."
- No.
- I feel all right.
- That's good.
I'm glad.
I'm getting old.
- Are you getting old?
- I don't remember everything.
"But you know what you always said, Dad?"
- What?
- You said that when a person reaches 80... they have the right to forget whatever they want.
- Is that right?
- That's what you said.
"So I tell everybody, if they forget something..."
"I said my father says, ""When you're 80, you can forget - you have the privilege to forget whatever you want."""
- How do you like that?
- [Chuckles]
I made that as a real... appointment... and maybe it's really true.
- I've got something for you.
"- No, no, no."
- I've got something for you.
- What do you got?
What have you been asking for for the last two weeks?
- I don't know.
What did I ask for?
- Take a look.
Come on.
"Oh, for heaven's sake."
Thank you.
My husband looks good.
[Chuckles]
What can I say?
I used to be thin once upon a time... believe it or not.
He wanted me to come up there with him.
You didn't go.
- You did the right thing.
"- No, I didn't."
He had no business there without a ghost.
"That should have been me, plus backups."
But Eddie was such a hothead...
I mean the kind that never cools off.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
"This one it set Tino up for the max, 10 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer...
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State Parole Officer.
Better pay and pension.
- Nicer surroundings.
- Think so?
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease...
Stop.
Just go.
Pleeeeease can we slow down?
Ow!
You're chafing my wrist.
Don't pretend you're not loving this.
Okay.
All right.
I think I just skated through some pee.
C-can we go back now?
- No!
- God.
"No, because we are not appointment-making control freaks."
We are having fun.
You are.
I'm just doing what you're making me do.
"Okay, okay, stop."
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Let's go back, let's go back, let's go back."
Why?
Why do we have to go back now?
"Why... oh, I get it."
I get it.
You're still scared to skate through the underpass.
"What do you mean, ""still""?"
"What do you mean, ""scared""?"
What underpass?
"Mitchell, you were 11 years old, and mom made me take you with me when I was skating with my friend Sophie King, and you were terrified to go through the underpass 'cause it was dark, and you were sure it was filled with monsters,"
so we ditched you.
I don't remember this at all.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
Cut the crap.
"Hey, watch what you say."
I wish we can sleep like this till dawn.
Is it okay?
What about your friend?
She and I do some things for each other.
"I listen to all her stories, so this is fine."
I'm probably the only friend who listens to her secrets.
So what's it like working as a manager of a cafe?
Do you make a lot of money?
Not really.
"But I don't waste money, so I can manage."
I hope the divorce goes well with your husband in Seoul.
It will.
Will you come by around lunch?
"My friend likes you too, though she doesn't show it."
I'll cook you hot chicken stew like you wished for.
"- It would be perfect with Soju, huh?"
- Yes.
Feels so good.
Can I feel this good?
Open the door!
Open the door!
Right now!
Hurry and open it!
- She's a friend of mine.
- She's too emotional.
Just stay quiet for a bit.
Open the door!
Open it!
Hey!
I'm telling you to open up!
"Not very much, Father."
It's just been bothering me for 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens you stole?
- Rocky!
You old...
"- Jerry, glad to see you."
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.
Good to see you.
Fifteen years.
Hasn't changed a bit.
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?
He used to stand right where you are and boil the tar out of me.
"Gosh, 15 years."
It doesn't seem possible I haven't seen you in that length of time.
- I've seen you.
- You have?
Where?
I was there when you made the 90-yard run against NYU.
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.
- Oh.
"Well, I got a kick coming, though."
- You have?
What?
- Why haven't you written to me?
"- You know how it is, Jerry."
"I changed my address and number so often, you had no way to answer me."
You know what happens to letters written in the stir.
Everybody reads them.
"Since I have a private number, Hallie won't pick up."
Neither will any of our friends in case it's you know someone annoying.
They will... call you back.
"But since we all have private numbers, it's nearly impossible for us to communicate by phone."
"Fortunately, I pick up my phone."
"Otherwise, this game of trading voicemails would never end."
Hello.
"Hey, it's Hallie."
Hey.
Jerk off!
This guy is on his cell phone and can't drive.
Sorry.
Hey... are you ok?
Yeah.
I'm ok.
How are you?
"Hey, um, you want to meet up for dinner tonight and maybe just... clear the air about everything?"
Yeah.
I think we should.
How does 8pm at Cascade sound?
All right.
Sounds good.
Great.
I'll meet you there.
Oh...
You didn't think I'd forget... did you?
"Wow, they're beautiful."
Thank you.
So what are the big plans for tonight?
"Well, that was um, Hallie."
"She wants to uh, get together and so we can talk about everything."
I think she forgot it was my birthday though.
She says it's reductive.
But I think it's a compliment.
"I mean, gypsies are all the rage on TV --"
"""My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding,"" ""Gypsy Sisters""..."
"""Keeping up with the Kardashians."""
Um [Clears throat] you mind if I use your bathroom?
"Yeah, go ahead."
But use the one upstairs at the back.
Mala's taking a shower in ours.
Right.
"Did you really lose the ""Wiener Winner"" by one dog?"
Yeah.
"[ Water running, door creaks ]"
[ Exhales sharply ]
[ Water stops ]
And what are we talkin'?
Six inches?
Foot-long?
"Look, agent."
Am I a suspect here or what?
'Cause unless you got a warrant --
[ Clears throat ]
"You, uh, ready to go?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Mr. Morgan, thank you for your time."
"If you remember anything else, this is our number and where we're staying locally."
"All right, so, we got what appears to be Wayne McNut's hair and..."
a bag full of weird.
"In Romanichal culture, the pouch is called a putsi bag."
It's used for hexes.
"Okay, so, what?"
Mala's putting hexes on hubby's competition?
[Horn blows]
[Horn blows]
2 of diamonds.
2 no trumps.
3 spades.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
"3 spades it is, then."
"Ahh, I can't help you much, I'm afraid."
"Ahh, for God's sake."
How much longer can they keep us here?
"Till after tea, anyway."
"Arthur, you think you should be working after everything that's happened?"
"No, no."
I have to keep busy.
"Yes, of course."
You and I have business to discuss about your late wife's affairs.
What?
Seems we're going to be in partnership.
"That's not-- when the Germans arrive, the high command, we'll be able to put them up here at the hotel."
We're near enough to the coast.
They won't arrive.
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
You do know that the Belgians have capitulated?
Yes.
"We saved her, too."
My God.
Your brother.
"This time, the governor won't have Serena to use as P.R."
He won't have to die.
We did it.
We sure did.
My husband must be sending out a search party by now.
I left my car at the hospital.
Will you take me?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
Friends don't let friends drive in a state of shock.
I'll drive you home.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
Does this have anything to do with Ruby?
"No, it's..."
It's the police.
That's who's supposed to look for guys like... him.
Seat belt's stuck.
- Thanks for the ride.
"- Hold on, wait."
- I'll walk you.
- That's okay.
"If I let a girl walk herself to the door on a dark night,"
I'd have to commit ritual suicide.
"You don't want my death on your conscience, do you?"
Or your blood on my sidewalk.
Yeah.
"Well, hold on, hold on."
- This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
"- You know, I'm on to you."
- What do you mean?
"Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?"
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
"Things are different now, man, all right?"
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
"Look, man, this is about respect."
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
"- Yeah, much flyer."
I respect you.
"- No, you don't."
"Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room."
Face to face
Just when...
Just when you thought Our chance had past
What?
I own this song.
I'll find a ride home.
No fair.
How come he can leave?
Nobody's leaving!
We just got here.
Our fun is only starting.
Let's hit that hill!
Yay!
Last one to the bottom is a rotten...
Fuck!
Ice-ball!
Goddamn it!
"If you cross my path today, Murphy,"
"I will scalp you, shit in the scalp, and slap it back on your head so everybody calls you ""shit wig"" and..."
- Hey!
"- Oh, man, don't hurt me!"
Yeah!
You better run from me!
"I'm afraid of your wife, you out-of-work pussyfart!"
"You see that, Sue?"
Everybody knows.
I can't even intimidate children anymore.
"Don't let him bother you, Frank."
He'll be in jail soon.
We can still have fun.
Smile a little!
"I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these busybodies looking at me like I have a fatal disease."
"""Oh, you poor man, how's the job hunt going?"""
"""I don't know, lady, how's your saggy tits going?"""
It's all in your head.
People love you.
"Come on, cheer up."
There's a pube right there.
I did that to trick you.
That's 100 percent beef you're staring at.
"Wait, why not just play rock paper scissors?"
"What are we, fucking ten?"

"Don't worry, it's a first draft."
Next will be better.
"Great, we're all on the same page then."
"Uh, the thing is, my problem isn't just the writing, it's the content."
It's frat humor.
"I mean, it should be about women."
"That's the point, right, to showcase women?"
Marty said it was just a first draft.
It's all part of the process.
"Just relax, all right?"
"Goldie, please, don't get so emotional."
"Now, Eli, in the second sketch--"

We shall fight them in the Kardomah.
We shall never surrender.
"Sorry, that was a terrible Diana Dors impression!"
On the house.
"Anne, you're a bobby-dazzler."
I know I am.
Help yourself.
"No, I'm full."
"Anyway, I'm on a diet, supposedly."
"I'm doing it with Pauline, the girl I work with."
She wants to lose three stone and take all her hems up.
She's got chunky knees.
"Yours aren't chunky, if I may say."
"No, but office solidarity."
You were very... manly in there when you took charge.
"No, I surprised myself."
Don't know what's going on with me at the moment.
It's all happening!
Didn't I hear you say your mother had just died?
"Yes, she did."
And did you live with her?
Yes.
House to myself now.
So thank God for this place!
She didn't like music.
She struggled.
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.
"Well, it is."
"Actually, do you mind if I...?"
"No, please."
I may have over-vinegared.
Not for me.
You'll have your old moniker again and I'll choose a Lady for your mansion.
Three full moons?
When she lays eyes on me she'll forget Henry and throw herself in my arms.
Just think of all the hardship in store for you!
The hard work will kill you.
That witch foretold deeds worthy of my heroic ancestors.
I'll earn the favours of the lady of my head.
Lady?
ls the girl worth it?
So many high-born ladies were ready to care for you.
But there's only one Elisa.
You'll have to walk the rest of the way... and such a way!
"No more la French, now you're a commoner."
And you must walk like this...
I see.
Like this?
"That's it, your Grace."
Like a folk hero!
What's that?
Damned dog!
What's that?
Crazy swans... help...
Murder!
Shot in the back!
"She's high and dry, poor thing."
Whatcher doing?
"Not water, no!"
It's water she needs!
Help!
Somebody's coming!
"Horrible monster, go away!"
What are you doing?
- I hope he does.
I hope my guy does.
Is that... is that the guy you're supposed to meet?
"- No, maybe that's yours."
"- No, I don't think so."
Are you Richard?
- How you doing?
"- Hey, Richard."
I'm Nathaniel.
"- Yeah, I figured it'd be you."
- Nice to meet you.
Right.
Right.
"There was a policeman here and a policeman here,"
- and the dead man was here.
- And where were you?
I'm pretty sure that I was over here.
"So when you came in, were the policemen already there?"
"No, no."
"I see this face of this guy, and he didn't look very well."
Did you know he was dying?
Was it clear to you that...
I've never seen anybody die.
So I don't think I would know that.
"I've seen one or two dead men, and they don't look like that."
They look very peaceful.
- He didn't look peaceful?
- No.
"You remember that, that he didn't look peaceful?"
What was... what was the...
I mean...
He just didn't.
(both chuckle)
Good luck.
Isler needs you.
He's not gonna let you go that easily.
"Yeah, well, if he doesn't, I'm screwed."
(sighs)
Well good luck.
(sighs)
What-what are the police doing here?
"Oh, it's no big deal-- they're just here in case"
Darrell shows up before you leave.
But how does he know that we're leaving?
"Oh, a little birdie might've told him."
What?
"Look, Melody... you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise."
"Why, what are you gonna do?"
What needs to be done.
(engine roaring)
"All right, you stay here."
You put Tucker in the car.
"I'll be right back, all right?"
"What's going on, huh?"
"They're arresting you, Darrell."
"Hey, what're you doing?"
Get off me.
LASALLE:
I did a background search.
You got outstanding warrants in Texas.
"That, plus assaulting a federal officer, you'll be going away for a long time."
"(grunting) Settle down, hands behind your back!"
"This ain't right, okay?"
You can't do this to me.
Mothers do love Izzie.
My mother would've loved you.
"Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took the condoms out of the cookie jar."
"I also replaced all your trashy magazines with back issues of the ""Annals of Surgery"", okay?"
Does it smell musty in here?
My mom's house smells like peppermint.
- It's so homey.
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.
- I was raised in a hellhole.
- This place is a palace.
"- Why isn't my house homey, George?"
I can't explain it.
It's just a feeling.
"Well, Izzie can't fix a feeling."
"She is freaking out, people."
Just tell her something I can fix.
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.
I've been sleeping there for weeks.
"Thanks, Alex."
You're... a good friend.
You're welcome.
Keep drinking.
- Mark.
"- Hey, there you are."
- Want to get a drink?
It's four in the morning.
"- I probably, uh, shoulda called first."
"Hey, I hear your mom's coming into town."
Good times.
You'll be fine.
Just keep the talking to a minimum.
"We'd like to eat, sometime this year!"
"Jude, how did the batting cages go?"
"Do we need to call the Padres, see if they need another big hit in their lineup?"
- Huh?
- I don't think so.
"Oh, come on!"
Planning my retirement.
- Bread me.
- Oh!
Guys!
"So we, uh, make an appointment yet for the hand surgeon?"
"- Uh, no."
- Why not?
"Well, I talked it all over with your father."
Is this about money or something?
Isn't that what the settlement from Vico is for?
- Fix my freaking hand?
"- No, Brandon, it's not about money."
"We just, um... we just feel that it's a little too risky, Brandon."
"And, uh... your father and I are saying no."
I don't get this.
"It's my hand, my money, my life."
And I wanna play piano again.
"Like, really play."
Why is this so hard to understand?
I want the surgery.
"Brandon, we are eating dinner."
Can we please discuss this later?
"Yeah, well, I'm not hungry."
- So you talked to Mike?
- This afternoon.
And you just... decided?
I know my way around.
"We're not committing to an offer yet, but if you have a number, we'll listen."
"Mr. Canning, are you with us?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was just texting my lawyer."
"It's funny, isn't it, lawyers having lawyers?"
"And my lawyer probably has a lawyer, too."
"We should all be getting progressively smaller, like matryoshka dolls."
Yes.
"So are we negotiating,"
- or what are we doing?
"- No, we're negotiating."
I-I think I have an offer for you.
A one-time offer.
- Zero?
Really?
"- Yeah, unfortunately you have five minutes to decide whether to take it."
I see.
"And if we don't, you have a bomb or something?"
Sort of.
Hi.
We're all here.
Where are you?
Just changing.
I'll be right in.
"The rash is back, Michael."
I know.
I'm trying the ointment three times a day.
You have to stop eating so much spicy food.
Yes.
No more Thai food for you.
"Oh, please, it's just poop."
"You shovel the stuff all day, buddy."
Me too.
If you can go slightly backward shake it to pass.
"That I can not befriend, retreat."
Running the beach not up to anyone.
Maybe move to the other side.
Do not have this side.
-And what have we got here.
Then they will have to return everything.
I am with children it's kind of dangerous.
I know.
-And we need to get home.
"I understand, very fair."
"But understand my side, champion."
One day I will have to protect my thing.
Because someone will want to take it from me.
"When I see, the whole world will see."
And in the background of consciousness I have a cruel reminder.
Once I stepped for a penguin.
"He looked at me, is gone."
"Goodbye, girls, hello empty beach."
-Got it.
"Yes, more ..."
So get out my face!
My mother says that every obstacle is an opportunity.
What?
"Dude, can apologize, or I'll break your nose!"
-He did not want to do this.
-All right.
And I still know.

A girl like me.
Would double as a superstar?
[Whooping]
You get the best of both worlds.
"Chill it out, take it slow."
Then you rock out the show.
You get the best of both worlds.
Mix it all together.
And you know that it's the best of both worlds.

[Singing] Jesse's back in the band but then things got out of hand.
He gave Hannah a kiss.
Something the world didn't miss.

Hannah Montana was getting frozen yogurt yesterday.
Did you hear about this?
Did you hear about this?
When asked why she got both chocolate and vanilla.
She said she wanted the best of both swirls.
Did you hear about this?
[Singing] Now Mile and Jesse can't hate.
Is that a problem?
Just wait.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute.
Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
"- You know, you're in a hurry and..."
"Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone."
Just a minute.
I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
"- Hello, John."
Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
"All right, I'll tell him."
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
"- You see, there's plenty of material."
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
"- No, you don't."
"Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes."
- You want two cuffs on them?
"- Yeah, one on each leg."
And hurry up.
Tell him I got to have them back right away.
"While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport."
So get out.
See the world.
Learn some new things.
I don't want to disappoint Simon.
He raised me after my parents died.
Helped me earn my Ph.D.
And I owe him so much.
But sometimes he can be so...
Demanding?
Hm.
More like tyrannical.
Kelly...
It's your life.
It should be your decision.
I wish I had as much confidence in me as you do.
"I shouldn't admit this, but when we were in Thera,"
I had the most awful crush on you.
Me?
Really?
Perfect timing.
That's odd.
What?
"Well, the Ark of Solon was made around the 6th Century B.C., in Athens during the Iron Age."
"But according to this, the tool that dented it was made from tin, and judging by these trace elements, it came from the mines in Cornwall during pre-Roman times."
Cornwall?
Isn't that near Exeter?
Yes.
"Why, does it mean something?"
I'd better get to the academy.
May I go with you?
Yeah.
So why do you think your grandfather's so hostile about Atlantis?
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
- Reagan --
- I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett.
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was -- he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
"In all of them, you attack him first."
But I had to!
He's a psychopath!
"- I killed him, and..."
- Go on.
"I mean, not him, but it's hard to explain."
That man is going to attack me again!
"I don't mean to offend you or make you uncomfortable, but, oh,"
- do you know what a nigga moment is?
- Of course.
"Thank God for them, or I wouldn't have a job."
"But an n-word moment, as you put it, does not excuse you from obeying the law."
"So if this is an n-word moment, Mr. Freeman, my advice is, do not be an n-word."
"Oh, hi, guys."
What are you doing up?
"I, uh, got into a little fender bender."
"I'm okay... just a little, uh..."
"Granddad, you got your ass beat again!"
"I mean, anybody can lose once or twice, but granddad stay losing!"
What?
!
You know what happened?
!
Do we know what happened?
!
Everybody knows what happened!
I caught the last half of it on the live stream!
"Oh, no!"
Why me?
!
Why?

"Kim Seon Joo, did I order the curry?"
I don't think I heard.
I clearly heard you order the curry.
Me too.
Weird...
"Maybe you were thinking of pork cutlet in your head when you ordered the curry, you may have accidentally said curry instead of pork cutlet."
"No, I didn't."
"Team Manager, you can switch with me."
It doesn't matter to me.
I like curry too.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
"She said she was buying, and she's just leaving."
I'll pay.
I'll pay.
But why is she getting so angry?
"She's not the type to get so worked up, it's weird."
What's there to get angry about?
I was mistaken.
Tell them to enjoy and that I'm sorry.
"It's okay, things like that can happen."
Enjoy.
How can I help you?
Excuse me.
We can make it for you as well.
Turkey sandwich and a coffee.
All right.
Stay seated!
Stay right there.
"I can take this off, right Doctor Kang?"
"Yes, please."
Now you're finally worth looking at.
"You know, i..."
I wasjust feeling good that day.
Yeah.
"I, uh..."
I don't know what to say.
"I'm at a loss, boy."
I'm at a total loss.
"I mean, here you are, supposedly injured, all right?"
You're collecting your lieutenant's salary and full disability.
I didn't even want to do this.
Matt had to talk me into it.
You know how stupid I felt?
"The lower back, it's an enigma."
"Pat, I'm gonna be straight with you."
"Obviously I have alternatives to pursue, but I'm not gonna... because - cause I don't want this getting out."
All right?
It makes everybody look bad.
"But from now on, you are back on full patrol."
Here.
Get started with this.
- A missing person's case?
"- Yeah, a bookie."
Jerry Green.
No one's seen him for about a week.
Huh.
Jeez.
- What happened to him?
"- I don't know, Pat."
That's what you're supposed to find out.
Right.
All right.
We talked earlier about the fact there's a shortage of wading pools.
You proceed.
- Nothing else. I've said it all.
What happened?
-Her complaint is that he teased  and whistled at her.
-l didn't!
Did you whistle?
- Actually...
"Did you whistle, or not?"
"- Yes, I did."
But not to her.
I swear.
- Then why?
I am a music buff. I like to fiddle with instruments.
He also broke into a song on seeing me.
What was that?
"""Me and you in a locked house"" ""And..."""
"""And... the keys not to be found"""
Constable...
Lock him up.
Tomorrow is court-day.
Make sure the keys to the lock-up don't vanish.
You can file your complaint.
I would like to tell you something.
"Yes, tell me."
It's our duty to arrest and teach a lesson to such third class loafers.
And we do it.
"But, there are some duties ofwomen too."
Like what?
I don't get it.
Just look at yourself.
Ifyou roam about in these kind of dresses... ..do you think instead ofwhistles you will hear the temple bell?
What's wrong with this dress?
Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine.
But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed.
This was the only way she could think of to help to let Johnathan Gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices.
Does it say what it does?
- Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
Why?
This is a weapon.
Against vampires.
Elena.
Hey.
Um...
Have you seen Stefan?
I need to find him.
"No, not lately."
"Listen, do you have a second?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
What's going on?
"- Well, it's Anna."
I've left her all these messages and she hasn't gotten back to me.
- Not even a text.
- Anna?
I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
"Yeah, we're more than friends."
"Look, something could be seriously wrong."
"And if you know anything, you gotta tell me."
"I haven't talked to her, Jer."
Are you lying to me right now?
- Why would you say that?
- That's what you do.
You lie.
You lie about everything.
Captain hunt.
There's one thing wrong with your ultimatum-
We can outmaneuver you in every way.
"Beka, seal the cockpit."
"Here we are,"
The revolt of the androids.
You knew it was coming.
I never got the memo.
"Harper... i was expecting a hangover, just not so soon."
"There's so much pain, harper,"
Just like in my nightmares.
"Yeah, listen, about that... we'll talk about it later."
"Right now,"
Dylan and your friends onandromedaneed us.
Argent?
He's gone there?
I believe so.
"And, harper,"
"When he kissed me, i knew"
"It wasn't love, like he said."
That's a mighty human thing to feel.
"But there's something else, harper."
"He also called me ""andromeda,"""
"And for the first time in my life, i knew... i know who i am."
"I am a warship,"
And i don't like running away from a fight.
Looks like you're going to get your chance.
Behind you.
"Back off, boys."
Beautiful but bad.
"My god, i am such a genius."
"It's still my job to protect you, harper."
You can't smoke here.
Did she talk to you that day?
Yes.
"Or rather, I talked."
About what?
My own business.
Did she mention me?
"To be honest, Lydia hadn't mentioned you in a long time."
This is all my fault.
No.
It was my fault.
This song gave me goose bumps.
"Marco, I've always wanted to ask you."
"Why did you cry the night I met you, after you killed the snake?"
It brought back a lot of memories.
What memories?
"Years ago, I had to kill another snake."
We were in Africa.
She had the same phobia as you.
"She was waiting outside the tent, terrified,"
"defenseless, and totally naked."
She saw the snake while we were sleeping.
Was she the one for whom you slept on the couch?
I hate that woman.
- I haven't seen her in years.
- Even worse.
What can I do to make you forget her?
Exactly what you're doing.
You were fast asleep so we didn't wake you.
Is Dr.Vega here?
He'll be in his office.
I saw him arrive.
Did all that happen when you came to get the keys?
No.
We go back a long time.
I fucked it up.
And?
It's getting too complicated.
I've decided to move out.
"Don't worry, I'll cover you for the rent."
But that's unfair.
I didn't know about you and Anna.
- You're not to blame.
- Can I stay here tonight?
I can't sleep if I have to be alone.
No hanky-panky.
Scout's honour!
"I have to go, Sophie."
Sophie's sweet caress showed me I had to break the vicious circle.
"If not, -"
- Johan and I would end up like Pierre and Sophie.
"Lonely, bitter,   spitting harsh words at each other."
I understand.
Forever seeking comfort in strangers.
(cheerful pop music)
(bluesy rock guitar)
So much for wanting to break the vicious circle.
"If Camilla was a trap, he'd walked right into it."
Told you his odds were low.
"I was never, ever going to expose myself like this again."
(nightmare music)
(Anna sobbing)
Are you OK?
Come on.
They're putting the fig leaves on the statues.
- Mr. President.
- Bob.
"I don't know whatto say, sir."
"As soon as we learned from the secretservice you were en route, the directorwas notified."
- He should be here any minute.
- Oh?
Where the hell is he?
"Uh, well, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir."
"So, let's go."
"He told me to take you to his conference room, sir."
"No, his office."
I wanta very private conversation with him.
- I don'twanna be bugged.
"- Then, his office will be fine, sir."
Okay.
Hi.
"How's the job going, Bob?"
"Frankly, itstinks, sir."
I have no access.
We'll see to that.
"He's nervous, sir."
He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He certainly isn'tacting like it.
That's Helms.
He's the epitome of Sangfroid.
Aworld-class poker player.
Yeah?
"Well, I own the fucking casino."
"I'm honored, Dick, thatyou've come all the way out here to Virginia... to visit us at last."
"- My friends call me ""Mr. President."""
- And so shall I.
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.
Went UA when his unit was shipped to Iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
DUCKY:
"It won't be far, McGee."
"Had the trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay, I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to sketch itself.
Ow!
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes, Doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene, or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh, you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Although the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"Oh, geez!"
Hello.
Sorry...
Nicrophorus americanus.
"Also known as ""the carrion beetle."""
"In here, you little monkey."
Yes.
A reminder that Shakespeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
- What?
A fishy fin?
"- No, a Mickey Finn."
"Oh, Mumsie."
You and these Mickey Finns.
I'll have no peace until I get one from the nursing home.
What did you say?
The doctors use them on the violent patients.
Why didn't you say?
Why didn't I think of it?
- Get me some.
Plenty of them.
"- Mumsie, I was only joking."
Wait!
Sit down.
"Ethel, I have something very important to tell you."
You know how much my reputation as a writer and as a woman means to me.
"You're loved and respected the whole world over, Mumsie."
"Till now, yes."
"Ethel, many years ago, your father was in China."
Money was short.
"I was young, beautiful."
"It was easy, and so was..."
I fell by the wayside.
"So, you slipped, darling."
So do tons of people.
You found your feet again.
"For some months, I lost my head completely."
"Ethel, suppose someone found out and was threatening to expose me to the world."
What would you say?
I...
"I'd want to kill him, Mumsie."
"I'm faster than you I've got more than ten ""daughters"""
What?
"I'm a ""ma ma san"""
"I love my ""daughters"""
Going shopping?
"Yes, chicken is cheap today"
Si Sun
Mr. Kwong
Buying vegetables?
Yes
How's Uncle Kwai?
He has to work late and won't be coming back tonight
Really?
I won't bother you then
Goodbye
You don't need to buy vegetables?
I've bought them
Who's that guy?
He looks handsome ls he your boyfriend?
You're doing better than me
"No, tell me or else I'll tell your husband"
So late?
I'm studying English
Drink it ls it chicken soup?
Where are all these lD cards from?
They're for you I've won them
There are so many women in Hong Kong who sell their id cards for the sake of gambling
"One day when I win the fight, I'll have everything not to mention id card"
I don't want it
Look at how bad this woman looks
She's a shame to our city
Put her to sleep
Come on in.
"Hey, you want a beer?"
Or an apple martini?
"Oh, that's funny."
[ALEX LAUGHS]
Have you told your parents?
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.
By pretending to be gay?
"No, by being more gay-friendly."
"Or, in real estate terms, ""gay-adjacent."""
Nice.
I'm gonna use that.
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.
I don't know.
"Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you I think you can pull it off."
"It's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag."
I have slept with her.
"It's just she, you know..."
Won't sleep with you anymore.
"Pretty much, yeah."
What do you think?
"I think you got a problem because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man."
Holy shit.
Observe your breath.
"Inhale, belly rise."
"And exhale, belly fall."
Bring your hands together in front of your chest.
Bow your head in gratitude.
- Namaste.
- Namaste.
Bad leg?
You haven't got any skill in your fingers.
"How's your castaway getting along then, Doctor?"
"Pretty bashed about a bit, actually, Jon."
God knows where he came from.
Bugger doesn't speak a word of English.
"He isn't from around here, that's for sure."
[Men laughing]
"Christ Almighty, Lukey!"
What the hell's the matter with thee?
[Ursula]:
When did Dr. Mead say he'd be here?
When he's finished his surgery.
So what do people from Poland have for breakfast?
Probably some awful kind of sausage.
But I'm sure porridge will do him much more good.
We'll soon find out.
Nothing wrong with his appetite.
- Glad to hear it.
Are the sisters of mercy in attendance?
"Yes, we are."
"Good morning, Doctor."
Shall we go up?
"Morning, Janet."
I'm glad to see that bruise.
"Doesn't look very pretty, but better it's there than not."
"Eh, nurse?"
What's his temperature?
- It's a little over.
Make sure he drinks lots of water.
"So, Polish, is he?"
It would appear so.
- You may.
- Now we're talking.
I'll start here.
This is good.
Can you tell me why grandma married the 4 of them?
Mrs. Maria Cecilia always liked to pick her husbands.
She also liked to boss them around.
She was so bossy that they all left.
"The one she really, truly loved was the one over there, with the mustache."
Maybe because he was the one who picked her.
"Soon enough, she got bossy."
"Told him to get rid of the mustache and told him to stop working, which he didn't like."
"When he left her, he said:"
"""I'll come back when you quit bossing me around!"""
Mrs. Maria Cecilia got really sad.
"She decided that from that point on, she'd care only for her granddaughter."
"Only her, and no one else."
Me?
- You.
Can I have some more?
- Sure.
Are you okay?
Wake up!
Say something!
Wake up!
Grandma!
Say something.
"What's the matter, darling?"
My present died.
- How come?
- She ate too much.
"She never had enough to eat, but there was too much here."
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"There's lore about spirits possessing people, riding them."
"Whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative, well, that's super."
[EMF METER WHINING]
SAM:
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here ghosty, ghosty, ghosty."
"-Come out, come out, wherever you are."
-I don't get it.
No one ever died on this bus.
It's not like there's a body here.
"But a flap of skin, a hair-- Hell, a hangnail--"
Something's gotta be tying the ghost to this place.
We gotta find it.
SAM:
Yeah.
"Got a new driving permit, issued two weeks ago."
[CLICKS OFF EMF METER]
-Just before the first attack.
-Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk MacGregor Sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
-MacGregor?
-Yeah.
What?
I knew his son.
"All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app."
"Oh, yeah?"
Wow.
"God, that's crazy."
"Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper."
"Okay, okay."
Alright.
"- Well, if your story's true..."
- Cooper.
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?
How'd you know where I am?
"It's a games company, I looked up the address."
"Yeah, really?"
"No, no, no, no."
How'd you find me here?
This place.
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?
"Yeah, with your GPS on your phone."
Find My Friends.
Find My Friends?
"That would've worked, but they took my phone."
"And it's in a building, like, a mile away."
"So, yeah, nice try."
That's right.
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!
"Look, all I'm saying is that"
"I think that you could've come up with a better story, it could have been funny or..."
"Okay, alright, don't be pissed."
Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Another war flick.
How boring.
How could you do this?
And you?
You are worse than a traitor.
You're a murderer who's going to kill all the people who won't be able to leave through this door anymore.
They promised to let me go to the future.
"We have you, fräulein."
We don't need him.
But what do you mean you can't come right now?
"Listen, this isn't a marching band that's coming, eh?"
"I want you in my office, now."
Espínola.
Espínola.
Espínola.
"It's gone dead, God."
Evacuation Order.
Have the agents return to their time periods and their homes.
Only essential staff and security.
"Yes, Sir."
And what do we do with Juan?
"-If you don't mind, take him to your house."
I'm staying here with you.
"-No, Angustias, you go home."
(Machine gun fire)
Well I think that I'm going to have to stay.
(Machine gun fire)
"Oh, thank God."
God and this wonderful machine.
You've got to hurry.
Lola is telling them about the Ministry.
To say that...
I love you   and that I don't want you to die and lots of other things...
Come over here.
I love you.
Shouldn't you hurry up?
They'll be here soon.
You look great.
Thank you.
"There, come on."
- Are you still up?
- It's skateboarding.
Is it skateboarding?
Is it exciting?
- Move!
- It's really exciting.
Move!
Then you have to go to bed in half an hour.
Sleep tight.
"Jorgen was a diplomat, so he was sent down there."
He sat down in the chair and he didn't say a word.
"Finally Baunsgaard asks, will they do it by 3   or will we have to pay overtime?"
"Jorgen said, you won't have to pay overtime at least."
I just fired all 42 of them.
This story gets better and better.
Last time it was 32.
"I don't know the cost in dollars and cents, but we almost went bankrupt."
But we had integrity.
"Integrity, Jorgen."
"- And cheers to that, Jorgen."
- Thanks.
Cheers.
- You're not drinking much tonight.
He's from nigeria.
Nice to meet you.
"Yeah, you, too."
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Well, at least"
One of the dubois women is happy in her work.
Bridgette loves working at the library.
She doesn't even mind the fact
That you can't really talk in there.
Will hate to see it end.
Meets all kinds of interesting people.
Even helped a nice young girl set up an e-mail account.
Hmm?
"Come on, bridgette dubois, librarian at large?"
Isn't that good for at least a smile?
Hmm.
"Well, I guess not."
"Hey, come on, I mean..."
"I just, I can't stand the thought of this monster getting away with this,"
"The thought of devalos losing his job, his license."
"Look, I know he made a mistake,"
"But the truth is, if that had been one of our daughters,"
I would've done the same thing.
I think he showed remarkable restraint
In not murdering the son of a bitch.
See?
It's easy.
Now you can write e-mails to whoever you want.
Wow.
Thanks.
You're a very smart kid.
And shut up.
"Right everyone, your work-experience placements have been finalised."
"And as 99% of you left it to the careers officer,"
I don't want to hear whingeing about where you're heading.
Sir.
There seems to be some mistake.
"Is the mistake you choosing to ignore me saying ""No whingeing""?"
"No, sir, it says here I'm going to work at a garage."
Yes.
Come on.
Me.
A garage?
- Does that seem likely?
- What's your point?
I wrote to the local paper.
To shadow a journalist there.
Maybe even write a few pieces myself.
"Right, let me have a look."
"I don't get paid extra for this, you know."
"OK, it says here that Sutherland is expected at the newspaper."
- Case closed.
"- Well, then there's clearly been some sort of mix-up."
I don't mean to be rude but  look at him.
- No offence.
- None taken.
"What was your first choice, Sutherland?"
Airplane driver.
- And that is...?
- Someone who drives planes.
- You mean a pilot.
- Do I?
- What was your second choice?
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
"Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty."
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
"Gunga Din, water."
"Gunga Din, bring water!"
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
"So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?"
"- Salaam, sahib."
- Who are you?
What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
"Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children."
The children are looking bonny.
"Come on, everybody, in the other room."
"Go on, get up."
On the double.
Get in there.
You heard me!
Quick!
That's right.
Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
"- Trinkets, sahib."
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
"- Go on, open them up."
Who are these playful subjects here?
- Never.
- What else did she say?
- That he was nice to her.
That he helped her get over Quini.
Thank you.
"Bye, buddy."
Goodbye.
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.
He doesn't work at the hotel anymore.
He got fired.
They still have some of his things there.
We need to get them.
MOTHER WITH FRIEND
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.
The photos of the girls were taken with a roll like that one.
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?
Where are my photos?
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?
"Aguila Photography, in Seville."
Someone places a prepaid order every month.
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.
"They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them."
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
You can see the reflection of whoever took the photo.
He's blurred by the flash.
Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.
"All right, but I'll need the negative."
"All right, guys."
"Winner takes all, a week without chores."
"Prepare to meet your doom, boys."
"Not tonight, French Fries."
This game is mine.
You know why the Flyers suck?
Lt all comes down to Lindros.
What a waste.
Sucked us dry and left us for dead.
"So, you gonna kiss me tonight or what?"
- Pair of nines.
- Pair of trois.
"Triple aces, boys."
I win again.
- Tweaker!
- Tweaker!
"You know I really like you, right?"
So you'd have to like gnaw on my lip for this to totally suck.
I guess it's not like in the movies where kisses magically happen at exactly the right moment.
Just like the formation of rainbows.
Wow.
Can you imagine if I told other people that you actually said that?
- It could be your dad.
- I'm in the shower.
- There's a thought.
"- Easy, pilgrim."
- It could be the guys.
- You gave them my number?
What?
I made pizza and we were gonna have purple cows after we kissed.
"Look, I'll make it up to you."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, Tony."
I never should have doubted you.
"Well, you didn't."
You're helping me.
"No, I-I mean before-- when you said... this guy was suspicious."
I just thought I knew him.
I still don't know why.
Grab his arm.
What?
"Yeah, just don't touch his skin."
Oh.
Perfect.
Bandage?
Right here.
Okay...
I can't get over your... speed.
"You used to spend months researching, analyzing, planning-- now you just... go."
"Jake, I'm still the same person."
The same person having a conversation over a dead body.
"You guys know I'm still here, right?"
Any luck on those prints?
"Uh, yeah."
"We got one, McGee."
Sending it straight to Abby.
Is that what I think it is?
Low-tech but effective.
Who's lead officer on this wing?
Uh...
"I'm real sorry, Lieutenant."
I don't know how we missed that.
"Well, the good news is, there are other cameras pointed in this direction-- we just have to look at that footage."
Restrooms stay closed until we can an M.E. here.
- So sorry.
Uh.
- Hi!
"Oh, it's you."
All of the research I could've been doing while chasing this Will-o'- the-Wisp Psychiatrist.
"- So, you hit someone?"
- With my cane.
I struck him across his fat face.
- It was fatter than mine.
- Why?
He had a leg tremor and Nystagmus.
- That's abnormal eye movements.
So?
- It was obvious he was in the advanced stages of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
I told him as much.
That's a neurological disease.
It's brought on by excessive alcohol consumption.
- She knows what it is!
"- I don't, actually."
"Well, you should, seeing the company you keep."
I-I still don't understand why you hit him.
He called me a nosy old Jew.
"Jew, yes."
"Old, perhaps."
"Nosy, never!"
"Ok, well, uh, good for you."
- What is that?
- That's a flight tracker app.
"He should be in the air by now, if he got on the plane."
"Makes you wanna dance, doesn't it?"
I am so sorry.
I feel like I've been in this car for four years.
No.
- I don't want it then.
- You bought it fair and square.
"But you said it was mouth painted, when really it was hand painted..."
- Calm down.
- Please get him out.
- I want my money back.
"- No, let's go."
Oh yes!
I'll just take your blanket then.
"- Frank, everyone's napping."
- Off we go.
- What's this?
- The mouth painter's blanket.
"- It's a bedspread, Frank."
- Why are you taking her blanket?
- Anything this thick is a blanket.
- It's too coarse to be a blanket.
- There's a bedspread and a blanket.
- Give me back my blanket.
- I need something to bargain with.
"- Look, I'll give you 1,000 for this."
"- Come on, she's a pensioner..."
- It's a matter of principle.
What an old con artist.
The nerve!
"We're helping a brain dead woman, all focused on that,   and old Granny Grab-All is just waiting for some sucker."
- She's just an old woman.
- I'm going to call my lawyer.
- Isn't that a bit extreme?
- Not the slightest.
Fraud is a legal matter.
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.
[BEN CLAPPING]
Great class.
We ran into each other.
You came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
You called to ask me if this was my class.
"No, you never called back."
Because you told me not to call you if it was my class.
It was.
- No.
We just ran into each other.
- Okay.
We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
BEN:
Exactly.
Do you want a swim?
Sure.
"You know, I was just thinking why can't we be friends?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?"
"I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?"
I hear you.
I mean am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
Right.
Or has an insane smile?
Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
[BEN CHUCKLES]
"- Did you just say ""dry hump""?"
- Yeah.
BEN:
"Erica, you were right to be upset."
Really?
Yeah.
"And also, to answer your question, when are you allowed to decide what we talk about?"
When you're ready.
"And apparently, that's now."
So...
Let's talk about Kai.
Ok.
"Ok, what's the catch?"
No catch.
Sit.
Please.
"Well, he... he is withdrawing from everything,"
And I feel like it's my fault.
Why?
Because you told him that you felt something for him?
"And he thinks that changes everything, and I told him it doesn't have to, but he--he doesn't listen."
"And you think that he's wrong-- that after your confession, that you can continue to be just friends."
Yes.
Because I made it very clear to him that--
That you were not breaking up with Ethan.
Right.
I know.
What?
It's funny.
"You know, a year ago, you and I couldn't have this conversation."
"You know, I would have shut it down and, uh, you would have dropped it."
You would've done as you were told.
Heh.
Yeah.
Things are different now.
He said that I was unfit.
"Now, all my life, people have told me that I'm very fit."
"My Uncle Lionel was in the fucking Olympics, okay?"
I didn't know that.
Archery?
Pentathlon.
"So, to tell me that I am unfit now when my fitness really matters, when the fitness stakes couldn't be higher..."
Here I am!
With nothing left!
Nothing!
You have taken everything that has meant anything to me!
You have--
Get a blanket.
Dennis.
What are you-- what are you doing?
"You're a doctor, right?"
"I mean, you help people?"
I-I do.
"I, um, heard you wrote a book about... people's private parts."
About sex-- yes.
"Yes, I did."
Is everything all right?
I don't think so.
I think... something's wrong with me.
"And originally, it gets produced in here."
"It's called a nocturnal emission or, colloquially, a wet dream."
It's incredibly common and perfectly normal.
Are you sure?
I couldn't be more sure.
Hasn't your father or... someone explained any of this to you?
- Ow!
- John!
{\i1\cH80ffff}Something they say is without a soul.
Dr. Rice?
{\i1\cH80ffff}You can't get good sushi here.
Colorado.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They must have been successful.
they told us to shut our program down.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They started putting the children to sleep.
{\i1\cH80ffff}We are going to save as many children as we can.
up north.
{\i1\cH80ffff}A place for mutants.
{\i1\cH80ffff}They call it Eden.
{\i1\cH80ffff}If you are watching this... {\i1\cH80ffff}...it means that I am dead.
{\i1\cH80ffff}I am not sure if any other children survived.
{\i1\cH80ffff}We were separated.
{\i1\cH80ffff}There is no more money.
{\i1\cH80ffff}That was a lie.
{\i1\cH80ffff}She's not my child.
{\i1\cH80ffff}But I love her.
{\i1\cH80ffff}You may not love her.
{\i1\cH80ffff}But she is your child.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Please.
I beg you... {\i1\cH80ffff}take her to safety.
Is this where we're hiding out?
We're not hiding out.
We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep... get a new ride and get outta here.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Harrah's Hotel and Casino
{\i1\cH80ffff}welcomes you to Oklahoma City.
{\i1\cH80ffff}Please keep right for valet parking.
Hey.
{\i1\cH80ffff}The fun never stops at Harrah's Hotel and Casino.
all right?
let's go.
It'd be better to say I was the subject.
Clara wanted to talk about me...
And boy she talked...
Did she say you were selfish?
That's what she always say.
If you think she's right..
-She's right about that.
I don't know exactly what selfish means.
Someone who loves himself more than others.
"Yeah, but that happens to everyone."
Some of them realizes and others don't.
Did she just say that?
No.
She talked more about...
I don't know!
I remember it was getting dark..
And I started crying.
I don't know if Clara noticed that.
Did you cry?
I've never seen you crying.
Clara talked and talked...
And she was making an image of me that I couldn't recognize.
Has this happened to you before?
Yes.
No.
That couldn't happen to you.
Why do you ask me then?
Clara said everything was over.
That it'd be better if we don't try it again.
That everything became an useless effort.
And what did you say?
I didn't speak much.
"Where are you getting cold, eh?"
-Mishanya!
- Leave me alone!
I awfully respect you.
Judge foryourself.
What makes a man happy during the war?
-What?
- Look.
"To stay awayfrom bullets, to have a good nap and a hearty meal."
-Yes.To receive a letter.
- That's true.
-Stepa!
-What?
-What do you think...
"- l'm not thinking now, I'm drinking tea."
-There is no happiness at war.
"- Nobody has asked foryour opinion, man."
You are too young.
I'm leaving in 30 minutes.Will you take a bath?
Then get ready.
"No, I'm not going to take a bath."
I'm no bloody Onegin.
What?
Can you tell me for sure when we are going out on a mission?
Does your ex-con soul long for some action?
You can not even kill a hen and you talk about missions.
I had no knife then.
"When I'm armed, I'll do anything."
-Stepa!
-What?
Could you demonstrate to him how prisoners are taken?
OK. I'll pretend to be a sentinel... and you'll attack me from behind.
Ms. French.
I found just the cabin upgrade you were looking for.
- You work fast.
- Follow me.
This was Amanda Kane's cabin.
Nice work.
It's been over a week.
You think we're gonna find anything?
Cleaning crew might have missed something.
So what happened?
You know as much as I do.
Amanda got on the boat and disappeared.
No.
"I mean, what happened with you after the story broke?"
You can Google all the ugly details.
"Kate, if you don't want to tell me, I'll drop it."
It was like...
A bomb went off.
"I destroyed my life, and I hurt everyone else in the process."
"I lost my fiance, my career."
But you know what the worst part was?
What?
Facing my mother.
"That day, she was crushed."
"She says she forgives me, but she hasn't looked at me the same way since."
You sure you want to do this?
What?
Search the room?
"No, not search the room."
Rescue a woman who ruined your life.
Amanda Kane didn't ruin my life.
She saved it.
- He's skin and bones.
I lost money on this one.
"But the price of the others went up by 200 liras, right?"
"Mr. Eduardo, it's going to be hard to win the war this way."
"Win or lose, I refuse to be trampled on."
"No, that's not an option."
Am I clear?
"No, no."
"They're too fat, too ugly!"
Too German!
"On top of that, they're too expensive!"
Am I making myself clear?
- It's unthinkable.
"- Alright, I understand."
There's no need to shout.
Fat is always useful.
We'll make soap out of them.
"Come, let's go."
They're going to turn these prisoners into soap...
That's their problem.
Tale a look at that.
Queen of the Skies.
"Queen of publicity, that's what she is..."
- What do you think?
"- Well, she's photogenic."
What did you say?
That they'll make soap out of them?
There's a shortage.
Soap is worth more than 200 liras a kilo.
and god knows people in Naples need it.
- You must be joking.
"- No, General."
That won't happen.
"Then if I do win, you'll have to do me a favor."
"And if I lose, just let Jung Yeon go quietly."
- Sure.
- Hey.
"Whether he wins or loses, he still gets the benefit."
"Hey, it doesn't matter."
I'll just end it quickly.
It works like this.
"The one who attacks first, is at a loss."
The rule is simple.
"If he strikes, all you have to do is dodge."
"And since you're fast, you can dodge him until the end."
"Here, try to hit me."
Okay...
I'll be okay.
"For real, this time."
One more time.
After you continue to dodge like this...
Counter punch.
The opponent may attack first...
But you can turn the tables on him instantly.
You need to get your ass beat.
"Yes, Officer Han?"
I'll call you once we're making good progress.
You can go to Yong Moon Plan when I do.
Okay.
Delivery.
I'm okay.
"The opponent attacked first, but you can turn the tables on him instantly."
[Important Issue
- Controversial Issue.
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
Do you really have one last bullet?
"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
- I'm gonna cut.
- Prep the area.
Here we go...
Tube!
We have an airway.
"I was looking for rings, trying to butter up her parents."
"I just called them, by the way."
They're going to be here in the morning.
Hard to imagine.
Losing your partner like that.
Yeah.
"So, Dallas."
It's a great opportunity.
You got all kinds of opportunities here.
- A state of the art facility.
"- Come on, you're a surgeon."
All you need is a sharp knife and some thread.
"""State of the art""!"
You're not going there for any opportunity.
- You're following a fella.
- I'm not following a...
Peter and I are going together.
Whatever gets you through the night.
"You know, she..."
She told me in the doorway of a Portuguese bakery in Montreal.
She was in love with a woman.
"And she was happy, you know?"
"I mean she was crying when she told me, but she was happy."
"Took a lot of guts, falling in love like that."
You guys stayed friends?
"Yeah, mostly."
Mostly.
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
Come in.
Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
He's here already.
"It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
"Do you want to hear the background of the case first, Father?"
Why?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
The doctors say I shouldn't.
But thank God my will is weak.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.
"She sparks every time, she does."
"That rifle does you credit, Hagman."
"Thank you, Mr Sharpe."
Oil sir
The secret is not to spare the oil.
So General Wellesley says.
Aye.
Ow!
Damn knee!
"Old leg wound, Hagman."
Rain plays the devil with it.
Aye.
Brown paper and paraffin oil is the only cure for a contrary leg.
I has a contrary arm on account of an argument with a French hussar...
"Oh, bugger it!"
...which we had at the Battle of Vimieiro.
"And which argument he lost, on account of me blowing his head off his neck."
But it do itch fierce of a rainy day.
And I find nothing work s so well as paraffin oil and best brown paper.
- Aye.
"- Oh, aye."

Gentle Spanish guitar
"She's beautiful, is she not?"
Yes.
You never loved a woman?
No.
Not after I paid for it.
So she's like no woman you ever met?
I think you should try to forget her.
"Because, you see she's no longer a woman."
She was the best student in Salamanca.
The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and... you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. but we really should go.
We can leave early in the morning.
as it were.
Pop?
Okay.
Sit.
you want some dessert? and hardly any sleep.
I'm fucking 90.
that's 101 reasons to keep moving.
Logan.
then what?
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.
And then we buy the Sunseeker.
Take the pills.
shit!
- What's going on?
- Nate!
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
check the sink.
They shut it off again.
They are just not going to let this thing go.
you might as well handle it now.
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.
We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.
all right.
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- By assholes.
- Hey!
No.
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome aboard.
Might I come aboard?
Yeah.
You remember the boat.
"Well, you know, I thought I did."
"- Or, you know, little..."
- But it's been a while.
You know that dock?
"Over there, there's a boat that looks just like yours."
NEIL:
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.
"- No, that's not my boat."
- It's definitely not.
But there's a very nice gentleman living on the boat who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.
"Oh, good."
Wasn't expecting visitors.
That's all right.
I just wanted to just come by and say thanks for helping yesterday.
"Beth, you know, I'm the same person."
I would do anything for you.
I just can't give you...
I just can't give you what you want.
You're what I want.
Our life together is what I want.
I miss it.
I miss you.
You see those guys my sisters are married to...
"You're more of a husband to me, not being married than those real husbands are ever gonna be, and..."
You know that photo that you sent me?
I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.
How are you real?
I don't...
"Okay, fuck."
I don't...
They brought you here!
"You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me."
"Nice try, good try."
I get it.
It's part of the test.
His patent got rejected outright.
"They said it was insane, it was dangerous."
Wow.
Really?
How much are they paying you?
Honestly.
Cos you're killing it right now.
- Have they given you something?
"- Sorry, I thought you were fake."
"But now I know you're real, I'm being a really terrible host."
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.
"- Cooper, what I want to do is..."
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.
- Cooper!
"- Sonja, relax, okay?"
Give it up.
"I know, the jig's up, okay?"
Let it go.
"Look, Cooper, there's more."
Five people have disappeared in the past year.
Sammy!
"""Sixties."
"Looks older""?"
"Senior roles are not to be sneered at, Ambrose."
- Gravitas.
Experience.
Maturity.
- Ugh.
We all have a part to play in defeating Hitler.
Not this part.
It's a corpse role.
He's dead before the end of act three.
Mr. Smith.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Mr. Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see--"
"You, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war now."
The war.
The war.
Damn the bloody war!
"The war has skimmed off the cream, and we're left with the rancid curds!"
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Marylebone Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
"No, we've been rather trying to keep this under wraps for the present."
It seems that there's a someone in Mr. Swain's department who knows a someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk.
That their engine broke down before they were even out of British waters.
Pity.
"Pity all round, really."
Your first draft boded so well.
- Well...
"At last, comes the day"
"Simran, what are you doing?"
"I had forgotten, Ma."
I haven't even the right to dream
"No my child, of course you may dream"
But don't expect them to come true
"And who know, Kuljit might be the man of your dreams"
I don't care.
I've bought your tickets.
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't
Babujiwon't let me go to college alone.
Will he let me go away... touring Europe for a month?
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years
Can't you make up an excuse?
"An excuse, I can find."
But I don't feel like lying to Babuji
Let me talk to Matonight
Europe?
- Yes
With friends?
- Yes
For a month?
- Yes
"Chutki, call the doctor."
Tell him that our Simran has gone stark mad
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first
You talk of traveling by Eurail?
"If he hears, he'll bring the roof down"
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
House owners fear you would sue them.
"- Since you approached me, I'll try."
You have a bike?
- Yes
- Can you take me on it?
- Do you ride well?
- Yes
-Then get your bike.
Too tall.
Only Anushka can ride on this.
It is this house on the left.
Stop.
My back aches.
-This is the 11th house I am showing you.
Please somehow arrange this house for me.
I should say that.
If you don't like this then I must arrange a film set at AVM.
- OK
The house owner is sharp.
Keep your voice down.
This is the best house in the area.
"The house owner has let you use the plants, old newspaper, bucket and everything."
We can fix this if it satisfies you.
The rooms are all very spacious.
But I don't need such big rooms.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent and an advance of 10 months."
Oh!
"I can't afford 20,000."
Ask if he can reduce the rent.
- No its impossible.
- I told you already that he is sharp.
That was the only thing that I could do.
I hoped days like that would arrive and continue on forever.
"So, I wasted away that young life."
It was a regrettable ending.
And so...
"You are saying that the grudge that the woman had possessed the cat, and turned it into a Bake Neko?"
What the...
Old master...
I guess she couldn't allow anyone from this house to get married.
Which means that woman's grudge is beyond redemption.
It is your turn to talk!
Your turn!
Who are you referring to?
I only did what I was told.
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!
I was just used by you!
I was just following orders!
"I couldn't rebel against it, even though it was something bad!"
It's cruel!
"Cruel, cruel, cruel!"
It's too cruel!
Odajima-sama!
What is still missing?
Old master!
Sato-san!
Answer me!
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
"It's not my fault, it's not my fault."
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
Sato-san!
It's a text from my Agent.
Entertainment weekly and in style magazine... both want me.
"Oh, and, and also, the flett-giordano syndrome foundation... want to come and meet with me here."
"Oh, well, this will just legitimize the hell out of it."
What kind of disease is it?
I-I don't know.
Elka?
"You know, I'm, I'm happy to lie to win, but I-I don't wanna lose my hair or anything."
- The only symptom is fatigue.
- That's perfect.
"I mean, I can play tired in my sleep."
"Ah, luckily, this disease hasn't affected my wit."
"Oh, that's will."
My baby's here.
"Hi, honey!"
"- Hi, just a sec."
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
"- Good to see you, sweetie."
- Yeah.
The facial hair makes you look a little...
"Foreign, but cute."
Come on in.
You know joy and Victoria.
- Both:
"Hey, will."
- Hi.
"Ah, this is Elka Ostrovsky."
"Nice to meet you, will."
Nice to meet you too.
"Well, your mom picks up and moves to Cleveland."
You must have a million questions.
"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey... in 22 minutes."
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
"Retool what, now?"
I'm the new Vice President of east-coast television and microwave-oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much-younger woman.
"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
"When I played that lady rapist on ""Law  Order,"""
guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out.
Hemorrhoid cream.
[Laughs]
"Miss Maroney, I have the cat wrangler here for you."
"Oh, is it that horrible little..."
Hi.
Hey.
Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.
Hi.
Great to see you again.
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to the feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Poppo.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
Would you describe yourself as cat-competent?
"Oh, yes."
Thanks.
Bye.
What's up this evening?
- It's Friday.
- Aren't you going home?
- Don't you have to go North?
- It's already Friday?
Then I'II see you on Monday.
silvia?
Surprise!
"Hi, little guy."
- See?
There's ciaparatt.
- Who's ciaparatt?
"We invited a few friends, Iet's go."
tell us about the hell you're going through down there.
"Just looking at them, they seem normal, but in reality they're dark, stocky."
No one's in the office in the mornings.
"About 11:30 they show up, at 2 off to the beach."
"With that heat, no one wants to work."
Do the women wearG-strings undertheirbIack dresses?
- And hygiene?
- They're dirty.
There was the start of a cholera epidemic!
It's endemic there.
Tomorrow I'm taking you and Chicco forvaccinations.
"I've already had them, the Red Cross came, you don't fool with cholera."
I worked in the South and I have wonderful memories.
I fell forit!
"My dearbrothers, I've brought you a small gift."
"The ""big tit"" of BattipagIia."
That's five kilos.
We promised.
I thought you were OK with that.
Yeah.
That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
"Now, I mean this room feels half the size it normally does."
I know what you mean.
It was fun the last full moon.
Yeah...
"Out there, all of us together."
It was...
It was a rush.
It was...
It was right.
"I mean, it was right."
Outside in a pack is where we belong.
The only reason we transformed outside last time is because we ran out of time.
"Mum and Dad, they won't let that happen again."
They can't stop us if we don't let them.
"Rhydian, I won't go against them."
"So, for the rest of our lives we'll just spend the one night we should we running wild, locked up?"
Yeah.
"No, I mean, no."
No.
I can't think about the rest of my life right now.
OK.
I'm with you.
Whatever you decide.
We stay.
Fancy coming to the exhibition with me?
Come on!
Don't you find it interesting?
What?
Ted?
You feel a little bit better now?
You're in no danger here.
- These people don't want to hurt you.
- Sure they don't.
The FBI agent just happened to be on the train today.
She wasn't following you.
Wasn't watching you.
She expects you to believe that?
"Let them go, Ted."
I'll stay with you.
"You and I will do this together, only you need to let these people go."
I will wait with you.
No one wants to hurt you.
We don't want to hurt you.
We want to kill you.
- No!
"- No, it's okay, Ted."
"- Ted, it's okay."
- Don't!
I will make sure that they never take it out of you.
"If you hurt one more person on this train, I swear to God,"
I'll make them leave it in you forever.
What?
"Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?"
I want it out.
"Well, I'm sending two technicians in to remove it."
No!
One.
One technician.
"Well, it's a delicate procedure."
It requires...
"Precisely, as he has no memory, he says nothing."
It's better.
"Go, now."
I have to open my shop at 9 am.
Let's go!
Go and have the stew from last night warmed up.
It will be better when we have the new Mexican paper.
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Montparnasse, quick!"
"Yes, sir."
Good morning.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"Come, I've already ordered."
I read your article yesterday.
"If my brother is alive, can I see him?"
I never wrote he was alive.
I just assumed he was.
"In fact, I worked deductively."
"At last, he's alive or not?"
"In reality, since last night, I'm... sure he is dead."
I even have proof.
I found this medallion in the sewers that serve the courthouse.
It's horrible.
Is it the medallion he always carried with him?
Yes.
I gave it to him.
"It is the effigy of St. Jacques, his patron saint."
I brought it back from a pilgrimage to Compostela.
Why weren't you more clear in your article?
You are right.
I should've speak to you before writing it.
What if I don't want to let him go?
I will have abortion right away!
"Auntie, where is Yawang?"
"From now on, you are not allowed to leave this room!"
"When my son is awake, you will have to marry him!"
"Xiaotian,"
I think... you'd better go back to academy.
"She is my daughter,"
I know her well.
"Being with you, she will be in agony everyday!"
"Xiaotian, Auntie is begging you, don't contact her anymore!"
No!
- She needs me now!
- Just end it here!
Both of you don't have the same fate.
Listen to me!
"By this way, both of you can live on well."
I don't care about what has happened anymore!
She is my woman for all my life!
Please be careful.
Slow down!
Get in!
Stop!
Xiamu!
Come on.
- I can't.
- Don't talk!
Just follow me!
"If you don't stop, you will spend your life in the prison!"
"I'd kill all of you, and spend my life rotten in prison, it doesn't matter to me!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"-You're the only voter i care-- -l'm getting that """"con"""" feeling."
-Like you're copping a plea.
"-No, come on."
No plea.
I'm just a pol who kept rolling along until he ran into a stone wall.
You were that wall.
And I realized...
... justlikeme whenIwasa kid .
"Young, ambitious, go-getter, but fair."
"Trading up, but always for the right causes."
You're doing good.
Not putting money in your pocket.
Just trying to maintain your position.
Your power.
What good are you to the people without it?
But down deep...
... youknowthere'saline you can't cross.
And after a thousand trades...
... andonedealtoo many...
... thelinegetsrubbedout.
"I had the fire in the belly just like you, Kevin."
"And the odd thing is, I still have it."
Never left me.
I had the dream...
... andI hadtheweight.
Like one of those guys before me said:
"""""lf a sparrow dies in Central Park, I feel responsible. """""
Well said. I feel that way.
I was gonna take that feeling with me...
... allthewaytoWashington.
The things you could have done.
Fucking things I could've done.
Carlos:
This place is starting to look like a dump.
- Why don't you take some boxes away?
"- Okay, boss."
Don't call me that.
Wow!
Where do you guys get this from?
It's beautiful.
"You know that can of paint up front, the white one?"
Yes.
Why don't you go get it and paint over that shit?
Everybody gonna like this.
It gives some cultural stuff to the store and the kids love that.
I drew that.
Eight years ago.
My mom used to watch me every afternoon.
"Altogether, it took about... a month."
Why you want to take it down?
- 'Cause it's bullshit.
- It's beautiful.
"You said your mom liked it, I'm sure your dad--"
Why don't you cover that shit?
You put a part of yourself into the store--
What are you...?
"I did that shit for my father, he covered that shit and now you want to uncover it?"
"When I come back, this shit better be gone."
Stop!
- Yo!
"Ten cuidado, coño."
- Watch where you're going.
"Right, right."
Okay.
Did you ever see me not backing you up?
I always back you up.
Why do you think I started with these intensive courses?
Ask me why?
I'm telling you I'll make an album for you.
- Really?
"- Of course, it's real."
- Promise?
- I promise.
"Ooh, look who's here."
"Yes, Mert. 3012 Mert."
Rafet.
"Actually, 69 Rafet."
What are we doing here?
"We'll leave, professor."
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you see?
I've been thinking of giving Rafet a nickname for a long time.
"- 69 Rafet is super, professor."
- Give me that camera.
You take this camera and get lost.
Close the door too.
Photo...
What are you doing?
Sinan... the camera...
What do you guys want?
What are you doing here?
"Well, would you believe me if I said we were just passing by?"
What are you doing here?
"We were just checking the inventory here, and I felt hot in the jacket."
"To do, you know, the warehouse is stuffy."
"We, Rafet and I, will be married soon and build a happy house."
"- How much law do you know, lad?"
- I was just guessing.
"So Scott-Padget's gonna rule the roost, run the ship his way."
- It's a chance.
- What for?
Scott-Padget.
Stab him in the back.
Give him Jonah's toss.
- Don't be a fool.
- Now look would the captain care if he died?
We're after bigger things than one man.
And we'll get them with patience.
- That's the only word you know.
- I know this:
If we touch one officer our whole cause is lost.
Do you think he heard?
That old drunk?
What's it matter?
- Didn't I tell you to clean this up?
- I did.
You call this clean?
It seems I have to teach you another lesson.
Come here.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
"- Not in the least, Mr. Goss."
I thought I should report that...
Report what?
Wheatley's recovering from punishment.
The others are back on duty.
You told me all this yesterday.
"Really, I wish, sir, to make a suggestion."
"Well, forgive me if I..."
"Stop, I said."
Get out.
Now!
Everything started on that day?
I'll try speaking to the Father.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
"Did you park on the street, or did you use valet?"
"Street, 'cause i-I can't afford valet."
Good.
Meter or lot?
Meter.
And i went to a coffee shop to get some change.
"Okay,give me all the alleys in the area"
By commercial buildings near the hotel.
Now you said you threw the knife in the alley where you parked.
Is it any of these?
"These are near stores,"
If you threw the knife near where you got the change.
Um... it's one of those.
Is it that one just off fordham road?
"Yes,yes."
That's it.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You did all right.
Print that.
We'll get our guys down there and check it out.
Looks like our paralegals have found something.
Let's hope it's a knife.
L.A.P.D. Is really working this one.
They love big media cases almost as much as we do.
"We found something over here,mr."
Nicholson.
"Oh,nice."
"Well,who says trial work isn't glamorous?"
Who's got a glove?
"I do,mr."
Nicholson.
"- No, I can't deal with this."
- You have a strange way of dressing.
"- See you, Sis."
I'll see myself out.
Locker rooms abound in peckers.
- He positioned himself oddly.
- You're such a prude.
"Christ, it's not really that bad."
- I rather like it.
- It's sweet.
But it's not art.
It's crap.
"Artistically, it's a piece of crap."
- It is bad.
- But not for an old lady.
"Still, do we want to buy it or burn it?"
"You're such a snob, Casper."
"Because a handicapped person painted it, you think it's crap."
- I think it's crap because it is.
- Only because a handicapped...
I've got nothing against handicapped people.
I like them.
- Sometimes your view of people...
- I've got nothing against retards.
Not the slightest.
Casper even shagged a retard.
You've been with a retard?
"Casper, have you?"
"- Yes, but it was before your time."
- I don't care when it was.
"Jesus Christ, you always think with your prick!"
At least I don't give monotonous head.
She was probably raped like her sister.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.
- What are those photos for?
- El Caso.
- How did you find out?
- I got a call.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Get out of here.
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving!"
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
"The harvest begins soon, and we can't lose it."
We already have enough problems with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
"They weren't killed here, there's no blood."
Someone drove them here and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
"You're from here, they know you."
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.
I'll do it.
With an remarkable result.
Imagin this.
"On larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
"Do you understand, we are whats left!"
We are the nations backbone
Or to put it like this.
With our beloved leader.
"""We have alot riding on us, to win the war"""
Sunshine?
"Protection of power plant, and the damms in Southern Norway."
Stop the germans from destroying to much.
Your in charge.
"Poulsson second in command, -"
- Skinnarland as radio operator.
"The rest you choose yourself, congratulation."
I though you wanted to get back in the field.
"If you want to stay here til the war is over and then go back to see your wife and child, thats ok.."
Off course not.
The war is not over.
"-Thanks, sir."
-Bravo.
You wont miss the fish.
No fish with this colour in norway.
No!
", i dont want it"
Its likely very beautiful there this time of year.
Its allways beautiful.
Do you know what i miss the most with Norway?
The View
-Whereever you look.
-Yes.
Starting to be a very long time ago.
It's so depressing.
I thought your friends asked you to live with them.
In a postwar building
On a street that's not even numbered.
It's lettered.
And its big selling point is that it's above a falafel stand.
"All right, well, listen, hey, I gotta go."
"There's no v.I.P. Area,"
But there's a nice set of bleachers.
Blair?
"You probably don't remember us,"
But we met you at your mom's fashion show.
"Uh, yeah, of course."
Hair band girl.
I never forget a good accessory.
We're celebrating.
We just got the most amazing apartment ever.
"You would totally approve- prewar, doorman,"
And the best part-fauchon is supposedly opening up next door.
Can I ask you something?
What do you think about falafel?
Ew.
Isn't that the kind of food paralegals eat?
I never thought I'd see Blair Waldorf
On the upper West Side.
Unless...
"Oh, my God."
Are you transferring to Columbia?
I hope so.
N.Y.U. Is so beneath you.
I- it's true!
I'm a Columbia girl now.
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can... can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
When?
Why?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Gordon!
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
No.
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range."
is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
He was not the looked for element.
I was actually afraid that he would kill me.
He finished...
"Got up, and, um..."
Said goodbye.
And i said bye.
That was it.
"Oh, my god."
"But he gave me my ziggy, so..."
Have you talked to anybody about this?
Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
You're the first person i've ever told.
"Oh, honey."
"There was a point where i thought that i had moved on,"
"That i had worked through it and whatnot,"
"But, no."
I know that i'll never be over it.
"But i know that i have to keep moving forward, you know?"
That kid is--
He's gonna have a good life.
But the name of his father
Is not going on that fucking poster board.
You're never gonna believe this.
Hey.
The theme for the school party
Is elvis presley and audrey hepburn.
"Oh, dear god, no."
Exactly.
Where's amabella?
She's in her room.
I'm admiring how beautiful...
"Remember after the remodel, we just walked around,"
Staring at how perfect everything was?
... you'dforgetwhogot you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur...
-... offtheCanarsieLine?
-Are you crazy?
A spur is $1 20 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps..."
... wecan'taffordit.
Then you'll have to forget the whole thing.
I love the second-act opener.
Then you won't wanna miss it.
"""""This was a real nice clambake. """""
I'm building up my lOUs with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop...

And the off-ramp?
Next year.

♪ [device beeps]
[exhales] Jesus.
You got a gut feeling about who did this?
I have someone in mind.
"Hey, didn't hear you come home last night."
I didn't.
I fell asleep in my car.
- You what?
- [chuckles softly]
You're working too hard.
"I know you want that promotion, but don't kill yourself for a swimming pool."
You're right.
"I'm sorry, did Ben Larson just concede that his job isn't the be-all end-all of everything?"
Maybe it's time I put us first instead.
Why don't you come home early tonight?
I'll be here.
Unless you want me to sleep in the car again.
[chuckles softly]
Um...
"Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
What?
[chuckles softly] What is it?
Um...
- [high-pitch squeal] - [groans]
Shit.
Migraine?
"Hydrate, aspirin, and caffeine."
- Lots of caffeine.
Let me see it.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
That takes me back.
"Believe it or not, I used to have Marcus's job."
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.
"You know, I used warm-up bats."
"They gave me a little extra ""pop."""
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
There was this one time- God Almighty-
"I was supposed to ""kneecap"" a guy."
Standard boilerplate stuff.
"I'd done it a hundred times, right?"
"Only this time, I take a swing, I hit him-Bam!"
And the bat breaks.
It sends a sliver of wood right into the guy's junk.
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.
"I swear to God, as I heard the paramedics take him away-"
They said that one of his testicles had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.
You imagine that?
That pain?
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Messy.
"Messy, unfortunate work."
"In my position, there's only one thing worse than a guy who can't make good on bets."

- A roaring fire.
"- Bread, cheese."
- Dripping.
"- Add a little love, makes a meal fit for a king."
I think they're happier being poor.
"Yes, or perhaps not."
"Oh, well, who gives a toss anyway?"
Let's check what's in the larder.
Any food?
"Erm, only a couple of dirty mags."
Huh?
"Oh, yeah."
I'm sure there's a reason why we shouldn't be doing this but I can't put my finger on it.
Don't overtax your tiny mind.
It's concentrating on breathing.
"Shut up, the cheque's in the post."
"Yeah, whose show is this anyway?"
"I'm the famous one, love."
"Come, let us go to the supermarket."
Right.
What a rotten shop.
There's never anything you want to buy.
For example...
"""Cruizos."
Bite-sized cruise-missile shaped lumps of potato flavoured snack.
"""Warning-will give you cancer. """
Everything gives you cancer these days.
You can't blow off without being told it's carcinogenic.

- Probably.

"I can forgive him, Elinor, and doing so, for the first time feel... free."
I am sorry for him.
"But I shall never forget how he made you suffer, nor his guilty conduct towards Eliza Williams."

"- Mama, enough has been said."
"...but he will always be extravagant and selfish, however often he repents."
And if you had married him...
"Oh, dear!"
I should never have been happy with him.
I know.

(TOM) Ma'am.
I'm glad Colonel Brandon is coming tomorrow.
Ah.
Phew!
I never seen Exeter so crowded.
Not this time of year.
I got everything you wanted.
"Sack of provisions, your linen and stuff."
- Miss Marianne.
- Thank you.
"That is excellent, Tom."
That's not quite the blue I wanted.
- Never mind.
- My dear.
Old Martin talked all the way there and back.
"He can talk, can old Martin."
- His Sukey's had another baby girl.
He's worried about her.
So I hope we are ...
Yes?
What do you say?
We're talking about cultural abyss?
A colleague who cut the fire rope to protect her.
Not to mention that he exploded right after all.
Was it because he was afraid of her?
He was afraid that she would kill?
Or something?
"Nixon, where are you?"
Hi.
'I brought you coffee. 'I'm not drunk.
I did not find it.
I know encrenco me sometimes.
but I will be able to stand?
You can not be better than that?
I took these.
Do not worry.
Mom and I arrange.
He barely had become a full member.
A larger funeral costs more money.
We can do it be worth it even if it is small and intimate.
-Let's Take it together.
-What Do you think of the club?
They cared about him.
And me.
We should not think about it?
"I refuse to go there, even for a funeral ..."
It was my husband.
I who decides.
The Ferrymen is more than a club of motorcyclists.
But they've all been losers.
You know... boring.
They'd have to be.
My father had to approve of them all.
Old Dalt can't be that bad.
He must have done something right.
- Why?
"- Well, look how great you turned out to be."
"Oh, me?"
Come on.
I'm a total basket case.
You don't even know the half of it.
"No, no."
My intuition about people is very good.
I could tell right away you had your act together.
Yeah?
When did you decide that?
In the convenience store when we shared that look.
Remember?
Yeah.
Thought to myself only if life were different... maybe I could meet a girl like that someday.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
"Believe it or not, when I was holding the gun to your back..."
I couldn't help but notice how lovely your hair smelled.
- You're crazy.
- That would be affirmative.
"You know, you really hurt me with that gun."
- You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard.
- I'm sorry.
"About the gun, uh..."
- What?
How dare you do that to me?
Is this how you're going to be?
"I was willing to endure all the pain till the very end, but you torture me over this crap?"
Don't you remember?
I told you how hard it is to fight with images!
So just give me the facts.
Not your bullshit philosophy.
"You slept with her, huh?"
"Oh, that I know already."
Did you walk over me?
"You and that bitch walked over me, huh?"
I won't cry.
Just tell me.
- Then I'll be quiet.
- You're completely insane.
"Tell me, please."
"Just tell me, Joongrae."
"No, I can't."
I can't be treated like this.
I don't deserve this.
I just can't.
"Sorry, I'm leaving."
"R. The Best Beach on the West Coast, Shinduri"
- Thanks for coming.
- What happened?
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.
There's such a muscle?
So there are muscles we can't use.
Guess it's like the appendix.
That's too bad.
You mustn't have worked on your script.
"No, no, no."
"It's...it's just that the caption at the end's going to be, ""He's not listening, but the enemy might be""."
It's a joke for women who think their husbands never pay attention.
"So if you start answering, you know, the captions won't make sense."
I wrote it!
The scenario?
I'll be in my dressing room... if anyone needs me.
Everybody take 10.
Save the lights.
Banished from the set?
What in God's name possessed you?
The actor was ruining the script.
Of course he was!
He is an actor.
What's this?
Penance?
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
"With more free time, I should like to do more work."
I simply don't know what to do.
You good with your hands?
I think so.
Yes.
Have you thought about factory work?
"And the version without the lines, please."
Whatever we used footage for carrots.
"Hello, Mable."
How's baby?
He's comin' along splendidly.
An appetite like his father!
He's eatin' us out the house.
"James is going to want your attention, too, with his reading."
I'll have him work on it.
You promise.
"Promise me, I mean it."
"They have children, as he is alive."
Children?
You see them years beyond their union?
Yes.
Use this to save yourself.
Tell henry you've had a change of heart.
That you won't stand in the way of their union.
This has gone so far beyond me standing in the way of anything.
I am convicted of adultery!
Of treason!
Mary is with sebastian.
And my son francis...
Has returned to court.
You are brave to come to me with this.
"Because if I can't convince mary to wed francis,"
"If I can't undo your mistakes, I will lose my head."
But not before I watch you burned to death.
I promise you that.
Catherine:
Francis!
Mother.
"Ah, it's true!"
You're back!
"Oh, thank god."
They tell me father's out hunting pheasant
Beyond the south keep.
"I'm going to find him,"
"Get him to see reason,"
Sometimes it's hilarious.
Like every time we hear that Drake gets in a fight.
"You're like, ""Dude, you're not a fighter."
"You're a stalker, that's what the hell you are."""
Listen to his lyrics.
Listen to his lyrics and tell me the man not a stalker.
He be... ¶ I can't get over you.
¶ You left your mark on me
"I'm like, ""What, you got 'em in the basement or something?"""
"He's just driving around in a random white van just picking up innocent women just,"
"""Oh, yeah, she looks good."""
"""Yeah."
"""Motherfucker!"
"""Yeah."
"""Get in the car, get in the car, bitch!"
"Get in the car!"""
"¶ Just hold on, we going home ¶"
I like Drake though.
"He's just so soft though, man."
"That's my dude, man, but it's just,"
"""Oh."
Motherfucker.
"""Worse, worse."""
"""Oh."
"Yeah."""
"""What I just said was so deep."
"It was just, 'Oh."
"Oh.'"""
Sounds like someone hit him in the neck with a dart.
"""Oh."
"""Oh, yeah, they hit me, bitch."
"Ambulance, come here, come here, come here."""
You nearly did.
- Shut up.
What was that?
"Nothing, I'm sorry."
"- We should begin, Dad."
"Okay, let's begin."
Sorry I can't stay.
You're all invited to the reception.
"Yitzhak, please come."
"I think the reading should be done ""mis en scene""."
Which means?
"Which means,"
"Monsieur Laroire, please come over here."
This is your clinic.
You're straightening the diplomas on the wall.
The wall is here.
"You're a plastic surgeon, you have diplomas, you took a lot of courses, straighten the courses."
"Mademoiselle Principale, please come over here."
Over here.
"Open the door, come in, and close the door behind you."
"Read, please."
"I don't have the text, I..."
"Not only did you not read the text at home, you think you know it by heart."
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor..."
Wait.
There's no point in just yelling at her.
You're in love with her.
Horatio.
So soon ?
I was just prepping the shooting vic from the condo.
"Alexx, is that a void in the blood ?"
I think our boy was wearing a wire.
"Yes, it looks that way."
You don't seem surprised.
Is that a fingerprint right there ?
Yeah.
"Whoever removed this wire, left his print in the adhesive."
Who was this guy ?
No one goes to this much trouble over a dead dealer.
We do.
We have an audience.
"Yes, we do."
"Give me a minute, will you, Alexx ?"
John... u can't be here.
How'd this mope get out ?
- Cop killers don't get early release...
"- John, I need you to stay out of this."
Stay out of this ?
Bob Keaton down there killed my partner.
Your brother.
What is it you're not telling me ?
I don't have that information yet.
You don't have that information ?
I've been on the outside since the day Raymond died.
"Yes, you have."
And it probably kept you alive.
What's this about ?
I don't know yet.
Just raises so many questions.
too hard for this guy.
No risk of getting hurt.
But is this right for me?
I'm kind of sensing a pattern here.
"You've got this great, beautiful chest on you with great definition."
You probably bench press quite a bit.
Is Seven right about me?
I hate for Seven to be right because he's always right about that kind of stuff.
"I mean, seriously I don't think that's jerky..."
I need a sign.
Is this right for me?
I got this great idea.
I know you're gonna love it.
Fitness fanatics.
It's my reality TV show.
Check please.
Separate checks?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Ready, Freddy?"
"We're walking, right?"
You don't want to drive?
"You guys, it's two blocks."
"They have valet parking, you know."
So where's Hallie this morning?
I don't know.
"I saw her on Tuesday, and I haven't seen her for the rest of the week."
You know that she changed her...
status to it's complicated?
What does that mean?
It's... complicated?
With who?
"Well, what if they find it on you?"
"Don't worry, they won't."
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured it out.
I'm sending a man around to the apartment.
He'll give you a scalp massage.
He'll have the merchandise in his pocket.
I got it.
Bye.
Which pocket?
Hello?
Would you like to try it one more time?
I should not like to try it one more time.
I should not like to see your face one more time.
"Allow me, sir."
Thank you.
Not at all.
"Could you help me, monsieur?"
It is lunchtime.
But my wife would like a treatment at home.
"Oh, the wife would like a treatment."
"Oh, monsieur!"
"Oh, but I cannot leave the shop."
"Oh, it'll be all right, Francois."
I am not Francois.
"Oh, I'll speak to him personally."
"Oh, well, if you think it will be all right, monsieur."
I should like very much to give the wife the treatment.
Thank you very much.
I shall get the equipment.
I think I have everything.
I appreciate this.
They can stand by.
"And when we're ready for somebody, they can be there."
MAN:
"How are they gonna be there, Lloyd?"
They can be right in the back.
"And then when we call for them, they can be there, right?"
I'm sorry.
I've been making movies for a long time.
People can stay off the set and be
Available when they're needed.
There's a little bit of-
- I'm not
Quite sure how to describe it.
But you can interview some people on the set.
There was a little bit of that actress stuff
"Going on yesterday, I'm afraid."
But I think we managed to nip it in the bud.
"No, not at all."
And I didn't plan on not doing it.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be fine."
[High-pitched noise]
"If we don't shut this off, we won't"
"Be able to hear the church bells when they start going, see."
"OK, camera is ready."
"Quiet on set, please."
Standing by.
WOMAN:
No more bell ringers.
[Bell ringing]
ALL:
Aw.
We'll be coming to Chicago tomorrow.
I wish I had more to tell you guys.
Sometimes it takes a new victim... new input to a case to break it wide open.
We're going to have to do an autopsy.
She marked her driver's license.
The donation was very important to her.
You can imagine.
Is there nothing you can do?
She lost too much blood from the wrist wounds... for them to be in any shape for donation.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
"Well, thank you very much for your kindness."
Brought those home last night... for her.
How many has he killed?
"As far as we know, 2."
Including my wife?
"No, no."
Your wife is number 3.
Don't call my wife a number.
Her name is Margaret Tattersall.
"I'm, uh..."
"I'm real sorry, sir."
What have you been doing down there?
Why didn't you catch him?
What have you been doing?
Want some coffee or anything?
"Oh, no."
I'm in enough trouble already.
But thanks.
OK.
See ya.
Holy shit.
Mistress.
My Juliet?
"Oh, still fast asleep?"
"Come, lady."
"Come, lamb."
It's time to wake.
"Well, you'll profit from a few hours dreams."
"Tonight, Count Paris will have other plans."
"But if your marriage will not let you rest, just wait ten years."
You'll sleep all you want.
"Heavens, how sound you slumber."
I must needs wake you.
Lady.
Lady!
"Oh, no!"
"Come, is my bride ready to go to church?"
"Ready to go, but never to return."
"My son... the night before your wedding day, your wife was stolen from you."
What?
Are you saying she is dead?
Flower as she was...
Death is now my heir.
My daughter he has married.
I will die and leave him all.
"Life, living, all is Death's."
This day had promised all my happiness... and now it shows me such a sight as this?
"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"
The worst that ever dawned.
Most woeful day.
Never was so black a day as this.
"I am divorced... wronged... hated... killed by Death, but Death is my future."
He holds all I love.
Do you think Brian killed Caleb?
"No, of course not."
But...
I washed it.
What?
Brian's shirt.
There was a lot of blood.
I asked him if it was from the fight.
He wouldn't answer me.
I got scared.
He was acting so crazy.
I didn't know what to do.
I washed it.
I'm so sorry.
Doesn't look good for our shirtless wonder.
"His alibi is definitely shaky, but we also cannot ignore the fact that she washed his bloody shirt."
"- Ah, to be young and in love."
- Huh!
"McGee, any surveillance video from near the crime scene yet?"
"No, but I got something else."
Come here.
"It's about Michael Thomas, and it's not good."
As if Gibbs isn't in a tough enough place with the director.
Turns out that Michael has a record.
As a juvenile.
I got a hit on a charge in Maryland from 1996.
- Records were sealed.
- Come on.
"Let's not panic, okay?"
Kids do stupid stuff.
May not mean anything.
"Well, it depends on the charge."
"You'll admit, as a secondary school teacher..."
The salary's also a deciding factor.
So cheap and good quality.
Bring something.
Here you are.
You pay in advance.
How much will it cost?
A hundred and twenty-nine.
It'll be the death of me.
"Hubert, and Extra at that - Sixty-six crowns!"
That's what we expected.
I must work out how much this dance of yours will cost.
That music's terrible.
"For that money no one... lf someone comes and asks you, don't go and dance."
This music. lt's awful.
Awful?
"What are you doing here, boys?"
"Dad, for heaven's sake stop that!"
"Do you mind, I know them."
"Okay, but you're not going to force anyone on me."
- Can't I introduce them?
"- No, that's not done."
Mi?
"ko, isn't your daughter dancing?"
"Not for the moment, maybe she will."
Don't you dance to this?
- She doesn't dance to this.
- And what will she dance to?
That's just what we needed!
What did we need?
This!
Did we need this?
Do as you wish!
I am going to divorce you!
I will divorce you.
That's enough!
Stop bringing my name up in your fights.
Get divorced as soon as possible.
"Besides, after seeing you fight like... this, I'll neither get married nor fall in love."
God damn it!
"Between parentheses, x equals 2x cube."
You should write too.
Minus x equals...
Sinan?
Is Gamze still angry with me?
Minus x
"I don't know, dude."
"She may have told you some things, right?"
You know that she's a tough one.
We also know the problems between her parents
"Seeing her parents like that, she's totally being drawn away from love."
We cant deny that she liked you too.
And you gave her hope.
Then you didn't even come to school.
"So, she's angry..."
"Can't we just solve these questions first, and then talk?"
What about you guys?
Look man.
My dad is calling.
Hello!
I am at my friend's house.
We're studying together.
Of course not dad.
Why should I lie?
- Hey!
"- Thanks, Mater."
"Good evenin', you two."
"Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this."
- Is that what I think it is?
"- Oh, I don't know, Flo."
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out.
Hello.
Not that.
That.
Customers?
Customers?
"Customers, everybody!"
And a lot of 'em!
You know what to do.

Throw down your weapons.
On the ground!
Throw down your weapons.
Silence.
"(LOLA) Let's go, there's no time to lose."
"How dare you speak to us, harpy?"
The Ministry has fallen and by your fault.
I'm helping you.
"The Ministry has it's defenses, it's own soldiers."
And I have sent the Nazis into a trap from which they can't escape.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"And what do you think you're laughing at, ""dumbass""?"
That you think you will defeat our glorious army.
We'll see about that.
To where?
To the Ministry.
It's the only way we'll know what's going on.
These will be our shields.
I hope that the Germans are good soldiers.
"Why, so they'll kill us?"
"No, because a good army would never let their General die."
Stay with her.
"No, I'll stay."
"The more of you there, the better."
Are you sure?
Yes.
The Ministry is what matters.
Let's go.
(HITLER) Oh. (YELLING IN GERMAN)
-Pardon.
"Sorry, sorry, eh... (SPEAKING GERMAN)"
Why are you smiling?
"Look, we know that she and the guy"
"Were getting real serious, right?"
"Well, maybe she got jealous about something."
[Mutters with mouth full]
Maybe she had somebody jumping.
Mm-mm.
No.
I don't think she's involved.
RICHARD:
Why not?
"She has a pretty face, sweet smile."
"Look, I don't pretend to know the answers."
I'm just trying to figure out the problem.
I'll tell you one thing though...
I want to know everything there
Is to know about that dog.
[Faint radio chatter]
"Now, tell me how you're doing."
I don't know.
Rotten.
Confused.
There's a whole nightmare going on all around me.
I'm starting to see a doctor.
One of those that Mother went to.
"Is that a good idea, uh, all the memories and all?"
Guess I trust him.
One of the few I really trusted.
OTIS:
I wish we could have some good news for you.
We don't have much of it yet.
Seems like with that boy we're just... any little thing
Will be of help.
"They kill the celebrities first, and then they fuck 'em in the butt."
"Will you just relax, please?"
There are cops always in this club.
They're probably just arranging an engagement party or something.
-Just hold on a tick.
- Yeah.
[Stereo] Toe to toe
Dancing very close
"-Body breathing - [Gig] Goodevening, Officers."
- What can I do for you?
- Are you the owner?
"Yes, I am."
Gig.
"Gig, do you know a guy by the name of Jerry Green?"
He apparently is known to come in here.
"Yeah, Jerry the bookie."
Comes in here all the time.
"Has he been in here lately, because, I mean, nobody's seen this guy around for a while."
"Ah... about a week ago, I think."
Huh.
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spine less movement
- And a wild attack
- You wanna get back to this?
- Maybe ask another question or two?
"- Yeah, yeah."
Where... do you find girls like that?
"I mean, who'd do that kind of stuff?"
"Well, you know, it's remarkably easy."
You'd be surprised.
"These two, I believe, we imported from upstate New York."
That's the logical choice for a Master.
But only nearby.
idiot.
It is the sixth day since the war commenced.
You are the first to make their way here.
boy?
O-Of course I am!
You want me to die?
!
and I'm no longer a Master!
I-I'm just an ordinary human.
I'm just a victim in all this!
when we can't do anything!
What?
Do you have a problem with that?
Of course not.
You are the first to withdraw from this war and to use this church's services since it was founded.
I will offer you every hospitality.
What?
You're saying I'm the only one that's been knocked out?
what will he say?
This is all you people's fault!
Rider!
Oh?
Then Rider was of no use to you?
Damn right!
she went and died like a dog!
Any other Servant would have been way more useful!
I did exactly as Grandfather said!
My preparations were perfect!
But those bastards all got in my way!
It was two against one!
"You do that a lot with your passengers, do you?"
No.
But I've driven Kelly home before.
So you are on first-name terms?
She booked the cab in her name.
You see anything suspicious?
Anyone outside her flat?
Nah.
Not that I recall.
You went straight to your next pick-up?
"Yeah, in Bermondsey."
Is she all right?
Kelly Mahon is dead.
You're joking?
No.
OK.
We might need to speak to you again.
What do you reckon?
Should get Ange to run some background on him just in case.
I reckon we should go and speak to Kelly Mahon's fiance.
I was working late and...
crashing in the office.
"You do that often, sleep at work?"
No.
We just got this big client.
I was under pressure to get their accounts finished.
That's where Kelly and I met.
My firm do the accounts for the lab.
Kelly didn't mind you staying out all night?
She would have ended up crashing at Chloe's talking flowers.
Someone can verify you staying at your work?
I dunno.
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
What did your father say?
"Nothing, what could he say?"
Is he dead?
"Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
Doesn't he come to see you?
No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Me?
None.
What's your problem?
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
No.
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
It wasn't that special.
It was.
Very special.
Who is this Babette?
"This is a new one, a friend."
"Tomorrow, you are welcome to get a room."
"You go to the reception desk like everyone else, so you won't have to sneak in here at night."
Then I'll introduce you to everyone else.
Fine.
I don't know if everything is fine.
At least it's not for me.
"Franz, just leave."
"Franz, please!"
Can't we lock the door?
No.
We're talking about months worth of work here!
Intellectual work!
100 Euros for you.
No more!
No less!
Thanks.
No way then.
I promised the people an event.
I want the seats full.
"And next year, we make your place into a respectable hotel."
"Alfons, this isn't just some quiz show here."
I'll make it sound captivating...
This quiz show is the dawn of a new era.
Who's dreaming here now?
Last offer... 300 Euros for me and you can call it a 99 cent show.
100!
"Thanks, then I'll look for someone else."
Who?
Where would he go?
Television perhaps.
"Oh, just leave it!"
You're going to wake him up...
So what?
God bless you!
Help me!
"Mom, why return so soon?"
Look at you!
"Such strength, what's yourshoe size now?"
Yourson...
Yourson.
Yourbabies will be someone else's but his will be ours.
Where were you?
If I'd known I would have picked you up...
I called many times.
You didn't answer.
"Oh dear, sorry."
Love is in the air.
"If you screw up love, it starts to stink."
Your husband's fingerprints?
Back again for a fidelity reading.
"This strong man, your lover, in his thirties, with wide shoulders..."
"Look sugar-puff; dunno about the wide shoulders with a guy at 58, I only care about his wallet."
Then he definitely has a son...
"Yes, he is cheating on you."
With a woman ora man?
"Listen baby-cakes, if you don't know this shit, shut up!"
"There is no strong, young guy."
"That old fart dumped me, okey?"
Which one?
But there's a young guy...
Enough!
"If you figure it out, just fax me orsomething."
"- It seems to say ignore these guys, I'm with you."
"Well, it's not Nick and His Friends' Infinite Playlist."
- Right.
"- Oh, that's sweet."
I say we do a drive-by.
No.
Absolutely...
I was loopy there.
I think it was pretty late.
Pretty early.
You can normally tell by our eyes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You didn't CGI out any of the red in some places.
I'm sure it was...
Or maybe you did.
No.
I took some of the red out of your cheeks in the exteriors because you looked cold.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- Hey, did you have to take out some of our icy cold breath coming out of our mouths?"
- No.
We just didn't use...
- No?
Look at that face.
"Look, they were falling in love."
"You see a bit of breath in this movie, don't you?"
"- Well, this is worth talking about."
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Kevin Corrigan.
"Ari, tell us about your evening this night."
"This was, like, 3:00 in the morning and we were supposed to shoot a whole other scene."
You're okay with me doing this?
That's what you came here for.
Who is he?
Takenaka San from Planet Music Japan.
Sleeping your way up?
Why are you working here?
I thought you were at Grand Pacific.
You've been lying to me.
I wasn't lying to you.
After the tsunami I couldn't pay tuition.
I graduated thanks to 1.4 million from your parents.
How could I tell you I didn't get that job?
Then return the money.
You said we'd merge our finances anyway.
Maybe not.
Maybe I need to rethink marrying a whore.
"""Sorry, I was trying to turn you into a delivery girl."""
"""But you made me want to go straight."
"I promise I'll be back!"""
Yes?
"If you're staying, you'll need to pay the overnight fee."
Why?
Your companion left.
He'll be back.
- But...
- I promise he'll be back.
"Could you contact him, then?"
What?
Call his cell.
Don't have his number?
"I have his email, I'll email him."
He's not coming back.
"I am a bear, not a cow."
"You hairy daisies, you think yourhairwill save you."
At least we look like real men.
Ever heard about Scottish drags?
They weartrousers like you.
Save yourbullshit for your cook book!
Being a real man doesn't mean you can't be polite.
Are you fertilizing the fur on yourshoulders?
You're all dying fora real man... and when you find one...
- Get the fuck out of here!
Right now.
"- Look, I was just trying to say..."
"Ah, of course."
Yourhairy ass doesn't get fucked.
What the hell?
Just leave the poor boy alone.
"Come on, it is yourturn."
"Wait here, I'll come back and wax yourshoulders."
What have I done wrong?
!
"Son of a bitch, he screwed up my show."
Why do you pity these people?
This ZENNE is a really great dancer.
AZENNE?
Amale belly dancer?
What's that got to do with yourwork.
I am just interested.
"Perhaps, you want to do art photography."
I could arrange an exhibition.
It should be easy with all your awards.
I don't know.
Stop blaming yourself.
!
Just write whatever you want!
I don't care!
It's not my homework!
It's your homework!
"Well, this time, we're just gonna have to make it fun."
Write it down.
Write it down!
Why aren't you writing it down?
!
That's not how Ms. Rinsky told us to do it!
"- Well, how did she say to do it then?"
- I don't know!
- Just write it down!
- We're supposed to show our work.
"Well, you didn't do any work!"
I did.
You should show her a picture of me.
Are you sure there's not some other instructions that
"Were sent home or something, something you might have lost?"
"Oh, yeah."
You know what?
There is.
There's a big ol' packet of instructions with
"All the answers to everything we'd ever want to know,"
And I've been hiding it from you.
"Well, go get 'em!"
Mom!
"Oh, no!"
It's your turn to go help aunt Edie and aunt ginny.
I went last week.
"Yeah, but last time, I accidentally drank"
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"
!
Emergency signal from Fred.
"What happened last night... you didn't have a choice, Phillip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan --
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to DC for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett -
- Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"- Yeah, he was one of the best."
"- Yes, he was --"
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
Stage three.
How long do we stay there?
Two days at the most.
Then we go to four.
"Well, what I wanna know..."
"Would you make a note of this, Cathy?"
What I wanna know is do we really need this set?
"Excuse me, sir."
I don't wanna interrupt you.
Is that the shark from Jaws?
"Yeah, I believe it is, Lieutenant."
That's the one that they used in the picture?
I think so.
"Well, that looks different to me."
I can't help that.
If we do scene 31 on stage four...
Could they have two?
I...
"You know, because in the picture..."
Lieutenant...
"...at the end, it got all mangled."
"Lieutenant, I know you didn't come here to talk about sharks."
I'm pressed for time.
What do you want?
"Well, I just wanted to ask a couple questions..."
We got wardrobe in five minutes.
I can give you two minutes.
Fine.
Thank you very much.
"I understand, sir, that you and your wife were living apart."
"That's true, Lieutenant."
We haven't been close for some time now.
And this flaming janitor comes out the door.
TJ is the janitor of the school.
"And after the building blows up, he's the person"
One that comes out in flames.
So Kimberly's gonna light him.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Now, this is a broomstick"
That's lit in flames?
WOMAN:
Just the tip.
It's like a long match.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, a long match."
OK.
"OK, so she ignites him, staggers along here,"
Runs around like a maniac.
Slides down the banister here and we'll
Put him out right down there where that big blood patch is.
INTERVIEWER:
He's playing a janitor.
Who you don't actually see before or after this.
"But you know, hey, we can light a guy on fire,"
"So might as well, right?"
"Now is there flames only on his back,"
"Or his front, or his side?"
His full back.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
Nothing on the front.
So that's why he's gonna be twisting.
"Yeah, I'll be twisting and getting the flame all the way."
And [shouting]
Neither does this.
Neither does this.

My sister preferred to study Dominion Over Living Things.
(SIZZLING)
"Tell me, how does she seem to you?"
Perfectly horrid.
-And her head?
-Bulbous.
"I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain."
"Three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking."
You can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
"Oh, yes, I can."
"But when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her."
(SPITTING)
That should do it.
Blow.
-Feel better?
"-Much, thank you."
There's someone here who would like to speak with you.
-Absolem?
-Who are you?
(COUGHING)
I thought we'd settled this.
"I'm Alice, but not that one."
-How do you know?
-You said so yourself.
"I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now."
"In fact, you're almost Alice."
"Even so,"
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
That's a good girl.
This will allow you to climb.
There are other dangers.
"Thankfully, you've got me to protect you."
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
"(Bird calling, wind whistling)"
(Grunts)
(Panting)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
"No, you're afraid."
"Afraid to talk, to reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things'll be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Oh.
The pirate thing.
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
Let's see.
You volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated.
You need to get back to a child.
That's not perception.
That's eavesdropping.
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
"Have anything to do with the ""Gossip Girl"" blast?"
¶ science will just have to... ¶
Is it true?
Are you dealing?
¶ all right ¶
"I was,"
"When I was dating Damien, yeah."
"But, no, not anymore."
This could so easily get back to dad.
I I think it'd be better if he heard it from you.
Are you insane?
I
"- I mean, you and I both know that's a suicide mission."
Look...
"If you want him to have faith in you, Jenny,"
Maybe you need to have a little faith in him.
¶ how many times can this be repeated?
¶
"Yeah, all right."
I'll go see if I can dig out a dress from my old closet.
"Maybe I can catch him at the gala-you know,"
"Big crowd, lots of witnesses."
Oh.
"Uh, is everything okay with you and Vanessa?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, at least I think it is."
It's been hard to say lately.
"Maybe you need to have a little faith, too."
"¶ all right, given our history, what can you expect?"
¶
It's great to see you again.
"You, too."
Bye-bye.
"Hey, Danny."
"Listen, I'm telling you there's something not right about those two."
You mean something besides the fact that they believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
"Just check 'em out, all right?"
I already did.
"Neither one of them has so much as a speeding ticket, much less a criminal record."
You don't think the guy that lost the money clip was in with them or something?
Could be.
I'll look into it.
"Yeah, because there's something strange."
"I just got this... this feeling, you know, that something's not right."
"Maybe it's like a sixth sense, I think."
Mr. Harpel.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were supposed to meet at Opus.
My mistake.
Nice dress.
"Oh, thank you."
"Samantha Marquez, I presume."
Logan.
Paul Logan.
At last we meet.
Excuse us for a moment.
[Clears Throat]
"[Sam] I'm not sure how they do things where you're from, but here, stealing people's clients is considered bad form."
Stealing?
"Far as I know, Harpel was never your client."
Mmm.
Right.
"Well, I could."
I don't know where Enid resides.
You are reckoning without the Brierley Nymphs
And Shepherds Association clipboard.
"As a matter of fact, the firm she works for happens to be in this building."
Does it?
Is it?
"We'll have to hack it back, Frank."
Seepage.
Lovely.
"Aye, you can smell the damp."
"Mr Kirkby, could you get everyone in lines, please?"
"You, there."
"You, on the end."
Stand up straight.
"Good evening, everybody and welcome back."
"Good evening, Miss Riall."
"Now, we have some new children with us."
"Could they put up their hands, please?"
Hands down.
"Now, the other children have heard this before, but being in the Manchester School Children's Choir is a great privilege and with privilege comes what, Hewitt?"
What?
With privilege comes what?
Comes what?
"""Comes what, Miss Riall?""!"
"Comes what, Miss Riall?"
"What does privilege come with, you nitwit?"
"I give up, sir."
It comes with this.
Chump.
"Well, it comes with responsibility, doesn't it?"
"Now, we have got a lovely new song to learn by Purcell."
# If life were movies

What were you saying about yoghurt?
"I didn't know which flavour, so"
I got them all.
You didn't get plain?
I didn't know there was plain.
I can only have plain.
I never saw plain.
"If it's not plain, it's not slimming."
"And then, too, after- when I got married -"
My husband was a lawyer.
And he was very active in the community- the gentile community and thejewish community.
He was a controller for the city ofToronto... and his office was at the city hall.
He worked for this place.
My husband's picture's the first picture you see when you walk in.
It's still there.
The entrance when you come into this building.
One day I would like to go downstairs with you.
Would you show it to me?
- Yup.
- I would like to see that.
- By all means.
- I would love to see that.
Any day you're ready.
- One day we'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It's a date.
- Okay.
- All right.
Right in the front entrance.
- Right in the front entrance -
- Wow.
- The first picture you see as you walk in.
"You know, there are a lot of pictures hanging from the ceiling."
There's a lot of pictures.
Yeah.
"- Well, he's there."
- Let's do it.
All right.
Let's see if we can find him.
I want to get you some answers.
Don't make me wait.
So who removed the wire from Bob Keaton ?
I don't know.
Still searching.
Just switched over from a local criminal database.
"Okay, take your time."
"H, I've been thinking about this crime scene."
"The wire, the scene being processed..."
"It's above my pay scale, isn't it ?"
Maybe all of ours.
Who's this ?
"""David Park."""
This guy's not a criminal.
He's a GS-14.
David Park has government clearance.
Let's have Homicide bring him in.
"Thank you, Eric."
Mr. Park.
Yeah ?
My name is Lieutenant
Horatio Caine.
Caine.
"Yes... now, I understand you work for the federal government."
Census Bureau.
I count people.
"Now, a GS-14 clearance is a little high on the food chain for a census taker, don't you think ?"
"Again,"
I count people.
"Well, I guess that could explain why I recovered your fingerprint from my victim."
And that would also tell me that you removed his surveillance wire.
So that's how you tracked me down.
"- From their denture cup, so that should count for two!"
- I'd say three.
If aunt Edie asks me one more time
If I've had my BM...
Why does she care?
!
You know what?
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should want to go over there and soak up every bit of wisdom
You can get from them!
"If I were you, I would consider it a privilege!"
Then why don't you go?
Because I'm trying to teach you to respect your elders...
And I did my time.
And you know what?
"Since you're fighting about it,"
You're both going.
That's not fair!
"Ohh, no!"
I don't want to hear another word.
Go.
No!
I don't...
ohh!
"We're useless, mike."
We can't even help our kid with third grade math.
Well...
maybe you should go
Talk to his teacher and get him some help.
"We were both banned, but I was banned first, so you have to go."
"Oh, I was banned last, so you should go."
"Okay, you know what?"
You are so good.
Wow.
Thank you.
We really don't even have any notes.
I think you just became my favorite network.
Just a few tone questions.
O-kay.
We're a little concerned that the characters all seem a bit too... angry.
Oh...
"Well, it... it's called ""angry men,"" so..."
"No, I know, and we love it."
Mm.
Shouldn't we maybe wait till the new guy starts and see what he thinks?
I think we want to make sure he's seeing the best possible version of this.
Maybe this is the best possible version.
It's not.
I'm gonna kill somebody.
Phew.
Thought that was just happening in my head.
Excuse me a moment.
"Okay, stop!"
Stop!
"I know you have jobs to do, but so do we, and it's just..."
it's... it's impossible!
Seriously!
Enough!
How many fucking bookshelves does this guy need?
!
It's true.
I heard he can't even read.
No one told us you were coming in today.
I'd have prepared a more embarrassing way to meet you.
"He mix ed them, sir, but he got busy, so I brought them up."
"- Ramos gin fizz, madam."
- Thank you.
"Our very best, sir."
Mr. Martinelli's private stock.
- Louis!
"- Coming, sir."
I got it all right.
Something in the drink.
Also my private stock.
That's all.
To the beauties of St. Louis.
- You disapprove of the toast?
- l'm thinking of a better one.
"If I didn't drink, he might fall in on Louis for tipping me off."
And if I did-
"- But I kept remembering, Louis had been Johnny's friend."
Maybe his only friend.
I needed Louis alive.
We await your pleasure.
Geronimo!
"A lovely word, with the added charm f or me of being meaningless."
- A St. Louis expression?
- No.
Just one I picked up.
"Your expressions have the Baretto flavour, almost medieval."
Baroque.
"Mobster, as applied to me, is more colourf ul than accurate."
I've always had a preference f or legitimate enterprises.
With a gambling racket on the side.
"Scarcely a racket, Mr. Murdock."
"More f or my own amusement than f or profit, as you know."
We tesseract to theandromeda.
"All right, all right, just give me a minute first."
This is incredible.
Why are you doing this?
"Helping us, i mean."
"That's what people do, isn't it?"
Help each other.
"Yeah... people, but haven't you heard?"
"I'm not exactly ""people."""
I feel my pulse racing.
And the warmth of your lips... how can i feel all that and not be human?
You're so much more than you know.
I love you for that.
There's one thing i don't get-
Why your employer
Would tell you so much about his plan.
It's complicated.
"You wanted to see theandromeda,"
But are you willing to pay the price?
Harper!
Why are you doing this?
Because i love you.
This is not love.
"Well, not you exactly."
I love your power.
"Tell me,"
Are you afraid of death?
You shouldn't be.
"I can't kill you, unless you believe i can."
"You're machine,"
Nothing organic in you.
"It's you who should kill me, like a machine must."
That will allow me to climb up into the air ducts.
(whistles)
"Holt, this is where you come in."
You're gonna create a diversion.
Can I do Church Lady?
Don't care.
I'm gonna do Church Lady.
Isn't that special?
(organ music plays)
"That will allow me to drop into Lester's laundry cart, and then we'll all rendezvous at the nurses' desk, where we'll sign out because this is a voluntary facility, and we can leave any time we want."
"See you later, Mr. Brown."
Or not.
Totally up to you.
"Sorry, Cleve-bro."
We're staying.
What?
We're making some real progress.
Okay.
(panting)
(ship's horn blares)
Dirty-Rassen-frassenpercalumin chabadamin-back-rackalacka!
"Ooh, a Jet Ski!"
Spring break!
Cleve gone wild!
Ahh!
(ship's horn blares)
"Aw, hell!"
I keep waking up tied to a bed.
I feel like Hugh Jackman's cabaña boy.
You should be so lucky.
You were pulled from the water by Somali pirates.
"And they kill everyone who isn't of use to them,"
Maybe buy some time.
Willhebe abletogetthisextremely volatile situation under control.
Muriel Walker's here.
"Thousands are gathering, leaving candles and ﬂowers.."
at the doors of the U. S..
We've got movement.
We've got movement at the Federal Reserve.
"Stenz, do you hear me?"
Confirming they're loading the money.
Let's wrap this up.
"Stenz, we're wasting our time here."
"Walker, are you sure they're down here?"
Did I spend 15 goddamn years running this place or did you?
!
This guy is losing it.
What do we care if he gets the president?
We made a deal.
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.
Walker has cancer.
His doctors gave him less than three months.
He has a golfballsized tumor on his frontal lobe.
Jesus Christ.
I think he's on a suicide mission.
You ready?
Yes.
What do you think you're doing?
If anybody can talk him down..
"it's her, trust me."
A little birdie told me you're finally moving the money.
Martin?
"I had to tell them about the tumor, Martin."
I tested it on myself.
"From what I can tell,"
Larson had no knowledge of the murder.
Keep looking.
♪
What if I'm losing it again?
What happened today?
I got an up-close look into the mind of a man
"I was convinced was a murderer, but all the evidence says otherwise."
Every explanation comes up in his favor.
Maybe he's innocent.
Maybe.
I've always been good at spotting guilt.
Haven't always been good at spotting innocence.
"Hey, hey."
You're not that guy.
"You're home with me, with your daughter."
You're in a good place.
But you don't know what goes on in that room.
You don't know what goes on in here.
"Julian, you can't do this job alone."
Find someone you can trust.
[machinery puttering]
- We're almost out of power.
"- All right, we need to move."
"Can you, please, clear the room?"
I'm gonna try to jump-start it.
[flatlines] [high-pitch whirring]
Clear.
Clear.
- You're killing him.
- Have to reset it manually.
Right now.
And I also want authorization to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?
I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.
You're protecting him.
What?
You don't know how things work around here.
"Yes, I do."
Just like everywhere else.
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.
You're just like the rest of them.
You'd rather things were like before.
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.
You don't know anything.
He's my husband.
You said it was over
"Yeah, it was."
Was?
Past tense... wow...
Oh my God!
Who cheats on their lover with their husband?
I have to go to work.
That's all you've got to say?
- Do you want me to lose my job?
"- No, I don't want you to lose your job."
I just want you to tell me the last few months have meant something to you.
"You said it was over between you two, Laura, finished."
You told me you wanted something different.
"Nice ass, Britny."
Britnay!
"""Nice ass, Britnay!"""
Brit!
"Psychopath then, is it?"
"Being bludgeoned to death with hammer, I think we can rule out manslaughter."
"Shame, really."
She's quite hot.
"Yeah, that makes it so much worse!"
"Forensics report, from Ken."
With the DNA results from the plaster found at the scene.
The ones I asked for half an hour ago.
"Erm, we were training, Danny."
That shit is sacrosanct.
"Yeah well, as long as your abs are ripped."
"Don't wish for it, my friend."
Work for it.
"Hello, Birthday boy!"
What a delightful woman she is.
Very...generous disposition.
Knows how to show her gratitude.
Only the best malt whisky.
"On the other hand, she's a woman of eccentric tastes."
Positively weird.
"Do you know what she asked me to do, Helen?"
"I couldn't begin to imagine, Siegfried."
"All right, I'll tell you."
She asked me to ask Tristan if he'd like to have supper with her.
(James) Ohh!
(Siegfried) On Saturday.
"James... you wouldn't care to hold the fort for me on Saturday, would you?"
All right.
(Laughter)
"Hey Sara, is your mother around?"
What do you mean who am I?
Don't you really recognize me?
It's not funny!
Don't laugh.
Can I talk to your mother?
Are you alone?
Do you like being alone?
Yes that's true.
We haven't been going out much lately.
But that doesn't mean I don't think of you.
"""WHAT MAX SAID"""
"Sara, you seriously didn't recognize me?"
It was a joke?
"Well, if your mother is not around, nothing."
Don't tell her I called.
I'm going to meet my friend.
Sir.
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.
"2 days ago, a man was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari."
Yes.
How do you know him?
Actually...
Then why do you want to know about him?
"Sir, I'm from the media."
You guys want news 24/7!
Why do you torture us for that?
There is a guy called Panju.
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.
"Thank you, sir."
Give him the keys.
Don't drink and drive.
Got it?
"- Okay, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
- Bye.
He is a relative of the MLA.
Won't you enquire all these things in advance?
"I will be careful hereafter,Sir."
Have you caught a single proper case till now?
It doesn't make a difference either way...
It's my mistake to have become a cop.
Don't go and drag another problematic case just because I said this now.
Get a case that will bring honours to the station and me.
Bring something that brings cheers to me and the station.
"Definitely, sir."
-Grade school or high schooI--?
"-Hey, Mitch!"
-Coming!
"Gracious, what lung power."
I teach high school in AurioI.
"well, what do you teach?"
What subject?
-You guess.
"-well, I bet you teach art or music."
"well, of course, I couId be wrong."
You might teach arithmetic.
"Never arithmetic, sir."
Never arithmetic.
I don't know my multiplication tables.
Nope.
I have the misfortune of being an english instructor.
I attempt to instill a bunch of bobbysoxers and drugstore Romeos with a reverence for Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.
"well, I bet some of them are more interested in other things."
How very right you are.
Their literary heritage is not what they treasure above all else.
But they're sweet things and in the spring it's touching to notice them making their first discovery of love as if nobody had ever known it before.
-Sorry.
"Oh, excuse me, excuse me."
-Have you finished?
"-Oh, yes."
"Yes, I have."
"-Wait, wait."
I'II turn on the radio.
Turn on the light above now.
"Oh, look."
We've made enchantment.
"-Three bullets, mustache."
- I'm not sleeping here?
- No.
You need a pee?
Go on.
I can't do it for you.
Then we'll go.
"Mum, I must tell you."
It's all gone wrong.
- What's the matter?
- Guillaume has a lover.
I'm almost sure of it.
Sure?
Do you have proof?
Loads of proof.
"Absences, lateness, poor excuses..."
He's always texting.
"If guys could lie, it would be easier."
"I tell you, he's seeing someone."
"I don't have to tell you, you know all that."
So I'm really pissed off.
"But don't worry, I'll survive."
- Did you tell your father?
- What?
He'd probably defend him.
We have about 7.2 billion people today.
That's going to go to nine and a half by 2050.
That means that we have 35 years to basically double the food supply.
We will need to produce more food than has been produced
In the entire history of the world.
That's probably the greatest challenge facing mankind.
"And I'll tell ya, I think we can do it."
Yeung:
Mine.
Kenzi?
Jenny?
- Yes?
- Hey.
You gotta hear this.
I was checking out Samir in our system.
"- What, he has a rap sheet?"
"- No, but Jenny does."
- Jenny?
- She was picked up a few weeks ago in the garage of Samir's office.
- No kidding.
- I checked with the arresting officers.
Samir told them that Jenny had become obsessed.
"He slept with her, but she became delusional."
Thought that they were having some sort of a love affair.
"What, so the entire relationship was in her head?"
That's nuts.
She's been stalking him for months.
"Begged us to keep quiet, didn't want his wife to find out."
- Which means what?
"- Look, our fox screen shows the wine Samir was drinking was laced with tranquilizers."
"Olivia did not have the presence of mind to drug him, Bo."
She's not our killer.
I think we have bigger problems.
Yeah?
Bo?
I found the head.
There's a note.
"""Beloved, I've taken steps to remove the obstacle between us."
Join me at the farm.
"We'll start our life together."""
I've been working all my life!
I went without food all my life!
Fuck it!

Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Go and look!
You can be a witness!
Give it back immediately!
Mr. Vanyerka?
Mr. Vanyerka!
It was here!
It was here!
Here it is!
"Here it is, here it is!"
"Here it is, here it is."
"Good work, comrades."
I'm glad you came.
They stole my car just now.
"I am Vanyerka Joseph, trustee."
Born...
I was born...
"Good, isn't it?"
We did what we could!
"The planet is actually controlled by a creature, which moves on four legs."
It's called a car.
It is the most numerous creature on the planet.
A car is used for moving from place to place.
The meaning of this moving is unknown.
"A car is noisy, comfortable... and gives off an intensive stench."
"Despite this, people live in perfect harmony with this creature."
They remove various obstacles from it's path... and build for it huge structures which are called highways.
[Sirens wailing]
Where's O'Malley?
- Pukin'.
- Pukin'?
"Yeah, it was pretty bad."
"One of them was still alive when we got here, even though the rats had eaten off half his face."
"Another psycho killer, just what we needed around here."
Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.
What do you mean?
Somebody offed some of the ghetto ghouls?
Is that what this bullshit's about?
You check it out.
I'll see ya down at the station house.
See ya later.
"Hey, Dalton, you want a TV?"
[Police radio chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
"Hey, Stevie, I don't wanna keep you awake or anything, you know."
Thank you very much!
"Hey, Stevie, it ain't so bad!"
"Yeah, let's go."
"Swing it in there, Steve!"
These comics are terrible.

"Nah, you don't remember ""buck Rodgers."""
"I just spoke to Washington, and they're..."
shh!
"Excuse us, hon'."
We got a little business to talk over.
Why don't you finish your breakfast out by the pool?
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.

* Texans who drill the soil
"* Baby, you'd make their oil boil CHORUS:"
Ow!
"* Soldiers, marines and sailors"
"* Grocers and tailors, too"
* Agree that you're rare
* And I more than share their view
* So tell your father and your mother
* And your sister and your brother
"* And the Texan, too"
* That they'll never ever love you * like I do
"* Oh, no"
Marrakech.
I need two thousand dollars.
Listen to me.
I brought some people to see you.
Look.
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces Marcus.
Indiana!
"Yes the museum will buy them as usual, no questions asked - yes they are nice."
They are worth at least the price for a ticket to Marrakech.
But the people I brought are important - they are waiting.
What people?
The army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
Wouldn't tell me what they want.
What do I want to see them for?
What am I
- In trouble?
"Yes, Dr. Jones."
We have heard a great deal about you.
Have you?
"Professor of archaeology, expert on the occult."
"And uh, how does one say it - obtainer of rare antiquities."
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You would be more comfortable.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"And you studied under Professor Ravenwood, at the University of Chicago?"
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Ah, just rumors really."
Let's call it a day.
I can still—
Hey...
Tohsaka!
Can't you see that Archer is acting strange?
we need to be on the same page.
I get it!
I'll go home.
I'll do as you say and go home.
then.
and good work today.
I was able to see you as a Master.
Archer!
we'll get to the bottom of this screw-up!
there it is.
The uncharacteristic lack of verbal abuse was troubling me.
look here...
Am I going to have to lay down the law?
You want to sleep in my room?
Of course.
To prevent a repeat of last night's error
I shall sleep in your room.
Surely you have no objections?
I do!
Big ones!
When it comes down to it it's your fault for falling victim to remote hypnosis from such a great distance.
I cannot protect you from Caster's magic so it's natural that I at least stay in the same room.
that's a perfectly sound argument.
tonight—
All right.
I'll have you sleep nearby.
Good.
"I know it hurts, Jenny."
You'll get through this.
Just give it time.
"- Maybe you should go lie down, okay?"
- Okay.
Come on.
How was your thing with the counselor?
Useless.
Jesus.
"So what are we thinking here, human kill or Fae on Fae?"
Don't know yet.
"I kept it out of the human system to be safe, but the wife's missing."
"Hale, where's the head?"
- Not here.
- What do you think did this?
Something went through those bones without too much fuss.
- And interrupted the poor man's dinner.
- Yeah.
"Hey, you think it was a misadventure with the electric carving knife?"
"Yeah, I'll just call the cleaners."
Any witnesses?
All we have is the text that you got from Samir's own cell phone.
Anonymous.
Not that anonymous.
"So Olivia ran out of the house, crazy as a loon and I found Samir, no head."
"Oh, and Jenny's upstairs sleeping."
Did Olivia have the weapon?
- I didn't notice.
- Did she have the head?
- I don't know.
Was it not there?
- No.
Was it all genuine?
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.
He will not stay long.
Will Margaret give up her room for him?
"The view is incomparable, and I want him to see Norland at its best."
Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.
"My brother, Edward Ferrars."
Do sit down.
Where is Miss Margaret?
I'm beginning to doubt of her existence.
"Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars."
My youngest is shy of strangers at present.
"I am shy of strangers myself, and I have nothing like her excuse."
"How do you like your view, Mr. Ferrars?"
Very much.
Your stables are handsome and beautifully kept.
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.
"An error led me to a family room, but I've rectified the situation."
I am happily installed in the guest quarters.
Tea!
They're all spoilt.
Miss Margaret is always up trees and under furniture.
I've barely had a civil word from Marianne.
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.
That is no excuse.
Library.
- These are mostly foreign.
"So, it IS raining..."
Huh?
"Oh, dear..."
What's wrong?
There!
"Hello, hello..."
Hello.
Huh...?
"The Middle East, Europe and the Communist Bloc...?"
They never give up.
They can't help it.
They don't have a grasp of the whole situation.
It's no time to be following old dreams.
Exactly.
"All things are in flux, and times change."
"Just as horse-mounted peoples linked East and West, and great nations that ruled the seas linked the world, it is our duty to expand the world."
"This Foundation is here for ""war"" and ""revolution."""
"You understand that, don't you, Yonamine?"
I understand.
"Shall we get into our main agenda, Yonamine?"
What is the suggestion you have?
Please have a look at this...
A support robot?
Yes.
"I am the ESR-M48 cognitive robot, Romlin."
I was bui;t to assist the Dangaioh pilots.
Have you heard about this?
I'm in Maintenance.
I don't know much about the Development Team.
Here is my certification.
"Since Dr. Kazamaki's busy,"
I am here today to give you three a physical.
- That was all business.
That's my beautifully restored Cutlass 442 you're driving.
"Okay, that was pleasure."
"But... now, here I am, offering you the payday of a lifetime as a gesture of good faith."
"And trust me, you do not find plays like this for sale."
All you need to do is find yourself a crew.
"Then you can buy yourself a whole factory of Cutlasses, like that. [Snaps] Huh?"
"- Okay, sold."
- Okay.
"- Where is it, Seth?"
"- Sorry, Richard."
Larry here just bought himself a 33 million dollar payday.
"Take it easy, pal."
- I'm warnin' you.
- Ah!
[exhales]
- [growling]
"- What the hell, man?"
- [roaring]
- Ah!
What the hell is your problem?
Ah!
This job is the old man's dream.
You're just usin' him to keep your bitch happy.
[grunting]
So that's why you hate culebras so much.
"It's not because you're scared we're gonna eat you,"
- it's because of her.
- Bingo.
Ah!
[Malvado] Could it be that this sacred bond between brothers has finally snapped?
Where do you think I got this?
"Ah, there would be some large shoes to fill."
"But what's in a name, Mr. Palmer?"
"""That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet."""
"That is Shakespeare, right?"
"No, no, no."
It's W.C. Fields again.
Oh.
He had a million of 'em.
"How's that angle for you, Tim?"
Can you see?
It's the west side entrance to the terminal.
"Yeah, a little higher, Jake?"
Higher.
Hm.
Okay.
How's that?
That's good.
Not bad.
"He's adorable, and he's tech-savvy."
"Yeah, that'll work, Jake."
Thank you.
"Not my first body on a toilet, Jethro, but always a disturbing sight."
Single blade to the left of the manubrium.
I'd wager that his heart was pierced in a single thrust.
- Do you need help?
"- Yeah, is there anything we can do?"
Yeah.
You can help McGee go through the manifest.
Both of you-- names and faces.
"Duck, take a look at the crowd-- looking for anything or anyone that doesn't look right."
At an airport?
Let me count the ways.
Bravo!
A prima donna is born!
Let's shower her with orchids!
"The world is yours, my darling."
The moment is mine.
"And I says to the wife, I says:"
"""Look here, my girl, if you think the world is..."""
"Good morning, sir."
"How about a nice hot cup of tea, sir?"
No.
"No, thanks, Poole."
"Would you consider a telegram from foreign parts, sir?"
"And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh?"
I know it's good news.
"Hobson told me last night that they were expected home today, sir."
"This is a great day for us, if you'll forgive me saying so."
"Soon be back to our regular meals, regular hours, regular ways, sir."
"- Your breakfast will be ready soon, sir."
- Poole.
Put on your hat and coat and take an envelope to the messenger office to be delivered by hand.
"- Very good, sir."
Ivy.
"Ivy, dear, it's me."
"- Oh, Marcia."
Hello.
"- Hello, lvy."
I didn't hear you.
"Hello, Fred."
"Hello, lvy."
"Get yourself a drink, Fred."
- I'll make some tea.
- We don't want anything.
My uncle says it'll come and take me
If I don't do my chores.
"He said that, huh?"
"Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again."
- Really?
- Yes.
"Look, go away."
What?
"As far as we know, no one was taken last night, but it will strike, and soon."
We'll kill it before that happens.
You must be great at parties.
We're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.
be patient.
Ronon's been going up against the wraith one on one for the last seven years.
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
"And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?"
It helps to have good hearing.
Right.
Carry on.
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
There is a presence here... but it is different.
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Damn it.
It's in there.
- Was it wraith?
- Yeah.
- You see it?
A bottle of soda was shot tragically.
I don't want our school to have a reputation.
"Like yours, you mean?"
"Everyone knows there are, like, fifty guns in school at any given moment."
And the fact that they haven't gone off before shows you...
what a totally safe place this is.
Give it a rest.
Geez!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
No one is going to get shot I promise you.
Who would write a note like that?
Everybody writes notes like that.
We write notes like that.
"Yeah, but we write notes that are true."
- This isn't true?
- Rayanne!
We barely made out.
You haven't been telling people--
"Oh, Angela, come on."
Hey Rickie!
I wouldn't blab about your personal life. I promise you.
What are you looking at?
- What happened to your shirt?
- Oh nothing.
- lt got caught on the fence outside.
"- So, can you believe all this?"
- Did you see anything?
- No. I was in English.
Maybe I should get a gun.
What do you mean English?
You were supposed to be in social studies.
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
- Maybe you need them.
"- These are for you, Jo."
- l'm the doctor.
Here.
- Ben -
You know what happens when you get excited and nervous.
Here.
Do me a favour.
Six months ago you told me I took too many pills.
Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder.
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.
- You've been walking around in circles.
- l haven't!
"Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine."
You'll feel better if you take these.
Nothing bad?
Look at us; do you call this a life?
"First my father, now Beatrice."
"I'm worse than him, much more wretched and vile."
I don't even have the courage to be cruel.
When will it end?
"It feels like I'm sinking more and more everyday, until eventually they'll unmask us."
"It won't happen, I promise."
"Mousy, stop."
He's dead.
I killed Painted Face!
I killed Painted Face!
Mousy!
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"I have enough cash to pay your salary for one day, so I gotta have results in 24 hours."
- Wah!
- Come on.!
Come on.!
"- T.M., I gotta get you dry, man."
"- T.C., you're killing me."
"Come on, Magnum.!"
Who's he?
"Oh, this is a private investigator..."
- A cop?
- I'm making a citizen's arrest.
Magnum!
Magnum.!
Hawaii is like every sensual woman I've ever known.
"She can have raging, violent bursts of temper, followed by incredible calm and peacefulness."
Today was one of those days of true serenity... when even the great tourist wave seems to recede.
"I mean, I couldn't believe the stillness."
"Man, business stinks."
"Hi, guys."
Hi.
"Rick, what's the exact time right now?"
"You know, everybody's on the mainland."
"Nobody even cares if my chopper's sittin' there gettin' rusty, just eatin' money."
"Rick, the time!"
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"So, where are you heading?"
Patagonia.
Travelling light.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you?"
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"I don't have any whisky, actually."
"Oh, no?"
"Well, then, you lured me here"
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
How do you see this playing now?
You tell me.
"Well, not such an elaborate routine next time you run away."
Why did you this time?
I'm always curious as far as you're concerned.
You said you wanted to go back to prison.
Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
So here we are
Nikolai Vanechkin is out with a rifle to protect his property
What a pretty picture!
Have a look at him.
Have a look!
"Not property, dear Pavel, but justice"
"Fedor is a war veteran-invalid, has a Medal of Glory, and he is entitled."
"--Medal of Glory, you say?"
--Yep
--Did you know that this medalist of yours stole my soap?
--How come?
"In 1943, took a whole brand new piece of it"
Happens a lot
"But the main thing here is that Nikolai Vanechkin, my best friend's father is out in the street...!"
"Beat it, or there's no telling what I might do"
"Pavel Ivanovich, leave or he'll kill you for sure"
Hands up!
Get down!
Shoot me.
Go ahead.
"Shoot, uncle Nikolai."
Maybe I'll even thank you.
It's not loaded
A piece of soap
Comrade Vanechkin take your weapon
"Take a hike, scumbag!"
"Kuziakin, where are you?"
--Did he leave?
--He did
--I'm here --Turn the weapon over to the police Take a bulldozer and demolish everything.
--Everything!
--What bulldozer do you mean?
You saw Veerbhadra's condition.
Come  fight me if you can.
wicked Jalandhar
Take your weapon
Pick your weapon
"""Mother, the fight between Lord  Jaldhar has become very fierce"""
"""What will be the result?"
"-Victory will be ours, Nandi."""
My lord will finish that rogue very soon.
Hail Lord Shiv
"""War is over, Jalandhar is defeated."
"We want privacy."""
"""What happened, Swami?"
"Why did you back away?"""
"""Devi, You only hold my hands and take me to an isolated place"""
You have never behaved liked this before.
What has happened
"""Nothing, hold me in your arms, come my beauty."""
"""Come, beauty."""
"""lllusionary Jalandhar, your death is near."
"You can't live any more"""
"""What sort of Shiv Leela is this, Lord?"
"- It is like that"""
And Shiv Leela's beginning  end can't be ascertained at all.
"""Now it is half-way."
"When it ends, it will only bring welfare."""
We all have to wait for that.
Shri Hari Vishnu!
Shri Hari Vishnu!
Come to Kailash Bhavan immediately.
Mother Parvati is calling out to you.
Some bad incident has surely happened
"Yeah, but you didn't."
I should have.
But you didn't.
How did you know?
I knew this girl Vicki.
"She, uh..."
"She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck."
She started acting crazy.
"You know, weird, and it seemed like drugs but then you showed me those articles."
And then I saw your face and how it changed that night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Look.
"You know you can't tell anyone, right?"
Who would believe me?
You'd be surprised.
Why didn't you?
Kill me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Like what?
Lost.
Why would you confront me about it?
Why would you risk it?
"Because if it was true, maybe..."
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.
ripped by looxlike
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...
"For over a century, I have lived in secret until now."
"I know the risk, but I have to know her."
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"Anna, your face?"
Thank you.
"Thanks, thank you."
"Well, what did Ernie say?"
"He get you fired, or what?"
"No, he thought I was funny, and he likes my look, and wants me to come in and audition for a guest role on one of his sitcoms next week."
- [laughing] Hey!
- [squeals]
- It's the fucking book!
- All right!
- It's the book!
- Holy crap!
- [laughs]
"- That's great, pal, congrats."
"You really well, what's the opposite of deserved or earned?"
[laughter]
"Ronnie, you asked and the universe provided."
"Yeah, I-I can't believe how much time I wasted looking for jobs when I could've just been manifesting."
[sucks in air] [groans]
"Jesus, it's like my father's drowning all over again."
"Okay, dude, seriously, call a fucking hotline."
Did you see where I put my boots?
Right here.
Oh.
[chuckles]
I'm such a jelly head.
[chuckles]
You sure you can't come tonight?
[kisses]
I'll blow you on the bus.
[sighs]
It's tempting.
I gotta sort out all this agent shit here before the buzz dies down.
- I can go like this.
"-Yeah, do that."
- How does that feel on the toe?
- Good.
Good.
Why don't you walk around in them?
- Did you want to try these on?
"- No, I'm just driving him."
- So those are comfortable?
- I guess so.
"I mean, they kind of rub my ankles, but all shoes do that."
I have low ankles.
"You think you deserve that pain, but you don't."
- I don't think I deserve it.
"- Well, not consciously maybe."
My ankles are just low.
People think foot pain is a fact of life... but life is actually better than that.
I'll say.
You should get some.
Your whole life could be better.
Starting right now.
I can't believe I got these shoes.
"And they're exactly like my old shoes, except they're pink."
"I don't need these, and they're not orthopedic."
But you seemed to believe everything he said.
Yeah.
I think he really knew his stuff..
He was very professional.
"See, that's how gullible you are."
"- You know, you meet somebody-"
- Christine.
"Oh, God."
"Gentlemen, such a crime must be punished to the limits of our laws..."

"Mr. Sanchez, do you have an opening statement?"
"A, uh... ."
A great...
... Cherokeeshaman once said to me:
"""To cross a mountain..."
"... youmustfirstwalkupto it ."""
I think that explains...
... whatweareall doinghere today.
"Come on, Josiah, get good."
Old Jonah dragged him off his horse and throwed him down.
Then the Negro followed him down the street.
-That's when he killed him.
-So you... .
-You actually saw him do it?
"-No, sir."
I come around the comer by the feed lot and there was Jonah.
His face was mushed in and there was blood all over.
He was deader than a hammer.
Did you see the murder take place?
"I'd have said so, wouldn't I?"
That's when I seen that fella there galloping out of town.
I drawed down on him and I told him to halt.
There was blood on his hands.
I didn't see it happen neither.
Sit down.
"Gentlemen of the jury, consider the facts here."
"But you're notable now, and that helps."
We're so excited you accepted.
The new book is really terrific.
"Oh, boy."
I wish somebody here would say something mean.
- Mean?
- Or honest.
It's unlikely that everybody here has nothing but praise.
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.
These are decent people.
(MOCKINGLY) They just want to be your friend.
"I know, that's the problem."
Sorry to bother you again.
- Is there trash in here?
"- Yes, I'm right here."
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
It's Philip.
You look like you're asleep with your eyes open.
I didn't even see you there.
You were looking right at me.
You were right.
This place is beautiful.
You sure you don't want any of these?
Brought you a whole box.
I'd rather just look around and stare at people.
I was surprised you called me.
I didn't see any way that I couldn't.
Things are pretty hectic with my new book and everything.
That's pretty cool.
"No, it's not cool."
"No, these space condition reports are recent."
"There is an odd smell, sort of sickly sweet."
"Yes, there is something."
"Could be the change of atmosphere, a different recycle system to that of the Liberator."
"No, it's more than that I can't place it."
"All right, shall we get on with it?"
"You go on down towards the stern,"
Cally and I'll work up towards the flight deck.
"Right, I'll just contact Vila."
- Are you awake?
- No.
That's what I thought.
It's very quiet here.
"If it should get noisy, I'll be in touch."
It's that same smell again.
- The girl's alive.
- So's this one.
The pulse is strong.
No visible sign of injury.
- D'you think they're drugged?
- What?
They could be drugged.
Possibly I don't know possibly.
They're certainly in a coma of some sort.
"No, it's no good."
"We'll we need the Cally, that's it."
"Cally, wake up!"
- Alone.
"- Yes, Cally!"
What?
It's Sonovapour Tranquillising gas Gas?
That's why we're so sleepy.
I thought you'd learned that lesson when you lost your daughter.
She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot.
No!
So much tragedy for one man to bear... and now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman.
Take the others back for questioning.
I'll interrogate this one myself.
No!
I won't let you hurt her!
Caylem!
Ralkana... he said you'd been shot.
"He was lying to you, Father."
I'm all right.
And your mother?
She's fine.
She was so happy to get your letters.
She wanted me to tell you something.
She forgives you.
We both do.
My sweet girl.
Captain.
I'm coming.
No one will forget what he did here today.
I'll make sure of that.
Chakotay to Transporter Room 2.
Do we have them?
"We're all back, Commander."
Take us out of here.
Gladly.
"Lieutenant, you heard her."
"The warp drive is functioning normally, and we'll have the main deflector back on line tomorrow."
"Yes, thank you, Mr. Kim."
"Captain, are you all right?"
- I don't know how.
"Ma'am, come to this window."
Do you know Peppe?
Are you crazy?
What did I do?
"Go home, if the director sees you..."
So peaceful.
They're all happy to have you here.
"And you, everything alright at work?"
I can't complain.
Can I tell you something?
Why get involved in...
You can ruin...
Are you married?
"Yes, we have a beautiful 8-year-oId son."
Yourwife didn't come.
"No, because..."
"We'd given up on children, an incredible joy, but since he was born silvia's become apprehensive, depressed, if I'd brought herhere..."
"Why, it's depressing here?"
She might get overit.
Of course.
"The move, school, packing..."
An outsider coming to the South cries when he arrives and when he leaves.
"It's true, when I came here I was upset."
- Just imagine when you leave!
- I don't think so.
"I'm fine here, but my home is up there."
"I Iike the fog, the people, the chaos."
Things you can't understand.
Coffee break.
- Good?
- Like only in naples.
"Please, continue to pack up."
Don't worry about us.
We have about 30 minutes left.
I'm... sorry.
I'll pay you back for the flyers.
- How... much is it?
"- It's probably around 30,000 won."
"Hey, give me 10,000 won."
"Kid, you should do your job right next time, okay?"
There are times when good guys get the short end of the stick.
But still...
I'm not really wasting my life away...
"Like Park Seon Woo said, am I?"
You're working very hard to clear the names of those wrongfully accused.
"This may be the time in your life, during which you shine the brightest."
Let's go.
"Oh, yes..."
He didn't show up?
He didn't call either?
I understand.
We will withdraw.
Yes.
The suspect must have had a change of heart.
- You got lucky this time.
- Yes.
Start being a decent citizen.
Hello.
"As I told you before, I found a good restaurant for you."
I'm thankful for your concern...
But I'll just stay here.
Mother...
If you continue to stay here...
Your unit served in both.
McKinney was there.
No chance McKinney did it.
"Look, the guy doesn't have a alibi."
He's impulsive and he's angry.
He's too angry to have done it.
CAROLINE:
I agree with Booth.
This was controlled.
It took planning.
McKinney's not capable of that.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
Look at those tire marks.
AUBREY:
They're fresh.
Yeah.
"McKinney was parked there, a half block away."
Then it makes sense that these tire marks are from the car that took Aldo.
The tracks run north.
There's a highway on-ramp three blocks away.
No way he took it.
How do you know that?
Because he's planned.
He thinks of everything.
"He's calculated, okay?"
There's no way he's gonna take the highway.
"I mean, there's surveillance cameras all over the place."
CAROLINE:
That explains why we have next to nothing to work with.
"Ah, not true, we know how he thinks."
What does that get us?
"We know that he takes the road less travelled, Aubrey."
Come on.
It's not much farther.
We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind.
What?
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?
You are without shame.
"Sookie, you do not have to do this."
What do you mean?
"Feeding my girls, making them happy."
I love doing this.
"Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt."
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.
"Yeah, eat."
I'm gonna eat.
"Can the help sit at the table, too?"
As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories.
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?
He's not much of a morning person.
"Now say, 'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '"
It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.
"- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding."
- Cool.
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things at every place setting...
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?
For the morning-after hangovers.
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.
"Jackson, what do you think?"
Aspirin over almonds?
No.
Here we go again.
"Yeah, let's just stay away from the flying boxes."
"Yeah, isn't this where we cited the truck?"
"Just up ahead, I think."
"Let's take a look around, okay?"
What about your buddy Getraer?
He won't miss me for another five more minutes.
This is important.
I'll check the divider.
See anything?
You?
The boxes could've jumped the divider.
Could be.
Pull it over.
What's the matter with you boys?
You want to get yourselves killed?
"May I see your driver's license, ma'am?"
"I was so afraid, seeing you."
You boys ought to learn to study those posted signs.
"Ma'am, you were using an off-ramp to get on the freeway."
And no wonder.
With those itty-bitty signs.
"Now, you talk to your police chief."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We're not L.A.P.D., see, we're State Highway Patrol."
"Well, better yet."
Then talk to the governor.
Watch out.
I'll write this one.
It's all mine.
And you boys stop speeding along on those motor things.
I'm just trying to be normal for once but you ruin everything!
You fucking live to fucking embarrass me!
You don't need any help with that!
Whoring yourself!
No... because I learned from the very best
"Why you never strike me as the jealous type, Irina."
How dare you!
What?
She was crying.
I just sat next to her.
She's my daughter!
I don't want you anywhere near her.
"Oh, what makes you so upset?"
You were never the most trivialist mother.
It doesn't suit you.
I think you should leave.
"I'd like that very much, Jakob."
Leave?
"Yes, leave."
I'm sorry for our misunderstanding.
"Beautiful piece of work, kindly donated by Lorenzo Quid... with the added bonus that he will personally hand deliver it to your home!"
and maybe stay for dinner.
"Ezcellent, let's start the bidding at 90."
Do I have any advances on 90?
"So, any advances on 90?"
"Thank you, Madame!"
Do I see 95?
Why did you do that?
What?
Dominique...
I didn't do.
You know what I mean.
Turn around. [all] Super mega final strike.
[all] Super mega star burst. [all] Fire. [grunting] Yes.
"Super mega rangers, that's a super mega win. [Gia] Wow."
It's back to normal.
[Emma] Yeah.
Oh look.
[Emma] Everything looks great.
How is everything?
"Oh, uh, almost back to normal."
Now all we need is a teacher.
Where's Mr. Burley?
Yeah...
Let me take care of that.
Mr. Burley?
Mr. Burley!
Are you okay?
I'm good.
But my crypto-zoological prizes must be saved.
Here.
Let me help you with that.
Phew.
"Thank you, Noah."
How can I ever repay you?
You can get out there and start teaching again.
Your students need you.
Hey.
Mr. Burley.
"Around this time last year, I asked the question, which species will outlast all others?"
"One particular student said that if humans work together, they can achieve anything."
You all proved that to be true.
I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.
"It's very clear that when faced with great adversity, the human spirit will always prevail."
"- Oh, nothing a little whiskey can't take care of, right?"
I'm sorry to hear about your parents.
My condolences.
They were good people.
- Thank you.
Isabel has taken it especially hard.
- Hmm.
Sorry to hear that.
Please give her my best.
- I will.
"Truth be told,"
I found it necessary to temporarily place her in professional care.
- Hmm.
"- I didn't want to, but Dr. Torrington thought it the best course of action."
They say Rosewood is the best.
"What is it, Detective?"
- Nothing.
Rosewood provides the best care money can buy.
"- Thomas, please."
"- Okay, I heard rumblings of strange occurrences many years ago, but they are mere rumours, nothing more."
"- Thomas, you would tell me if there were reason to be concerned, would you not?"
"- Yes, of course I would."
Of course I would tell you.
"Please, pay me no mind."
"When I drink, I speak heedlessly."
"Look, set your mind at ease, all right?"
Your sister's gonna be just fine.
She's in good hands.
- You.
Have you seen me?
This is not me!
It's not me.
College for five kids won't be cheap.
We're having three.
It won't matter if you're not around for the honeymoon.
I'll be around.
It's gonna be the best years of our lives.
- Just five more spins.
- Three.
"Okay, we've found them."
- You see anything?
- Besides two scoundrels in love?
"No, but they might have something off-site."
I'm gonna go toss their room.
Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit's foot or adjusting a magic girdle.
Red 23.
- Careful!
- Stop yelling!
- Start listening!
- I'm so running over your toes.
- Just get it straight.
Not like that!
- Okay!
- Can you close the door?
- Got it.
You know what?
"Pull all the Dodgson files, would you?"
"And anything that's got a listed cross-reference, like Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll."
- What are you still standing here for?
- I'm not your girl Friday.
What kept you?
Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat you keep promising to fix.
What's this?
- This is why I called you.
- Good bye.
Hello.
Who was he?
The Tomaji parson lord.
Do you know it?
Sure.
It is can not to entrust it in nobody.
I have the pistol there always under my pillow.
"Shoot it if he is putting in his foot here once more, my Mariska"
"Well of course, major lord."
As if I would be exchanged kind Tót family.
I slept very well.
"Although I had bad dreams, but like that, as if I would be exchanged."
"We are very happy, major lord."
And this the air.
This silence.
This place is sound-proof.
Than the black velvet.
A guest of ours said it about him.
Yeah!
It is this punctually!
Than the black velvet.
Lõrinc lord's state a unfortunate railway reverse gear caused.
"Calm down, major lord!"
- You Sándor.
What you knock here?
- What should I do Lajos?
It is itching.
This rotten plaster is since 4 weeks on me.
"Than the malady, is itching so."
Well go then into the house or behind the house.
My own garden not i can do what I want?
How could you do such a thing?
"No, I don't want that one!"
I want Mario!
He's too ugly.
- Shut up!
"- No, Mario!"
"Don't worry, Sir, I'll handle it."
- I want Mario!
"Mario, it was me!"
I found him!
It was your Quirino!
"If it were up to the lawyers, you'd never get out!"
I did it!
"- Mama, are you OK?"
The Tribunal.
Mama.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
"Oh God, what now!"
"In the name of the Italian people, by article 479 of the Criminal Code, this tribunal acquits.."
"- Valeria, did you hear?"
Acquitted!
".. of the Code for not having committed the deed, and orders the immediate release if not detained for another reason."
- Mario!
"In this moment, I must inform Mario De Santis, who is present of having incriminated himself.."
"- What, Sir!"
- Nothing.
.. the crime of autocalumny!
"Autocalumny, what's that?"
"- Don't worry, it's a misdemeanor of 1-3 years."
"Because having confessed before this Court, he blamed himself for the crime of bigamy, which he knew had never happened."
This is the warrant.
- The warrant?
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
-What kind is that?
-The kind that re-elects the President.
Where else?
Second cities like Chicago?
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden that nominates a Mondale.
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
We'll make you a winner right here.
"You're not a New Yorker, are you?"
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
Huey Long country.
"""""Every man a king,"""" but no one wears a crown."
I love this guy.
Thank you so much.
Lovely evening.
"Kevin, give me a call in the morning."
I need some stuff for The New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
-Let me assure you--
-The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
-Thank you.
But you don't seem to care.
Who cares about a bunch of nurses powdering their noses?
"When are we gonna get those new movies you promised, huh?"
- [ All Clamoring ]
"- Patience, everybody."
Patience.
"At this very moment, an emissary is tracking down one of Hollywood's finest."
"- Oh, yeah."
Sure.
- Here comes Mr. Show Business now.
"Any luck, ""Shobe""?"
"So far, the only nibble is a movie called Terror in the Tiny Town."
It's a Western with an all-midget cast.
"- Oh, great."
"What do we do, show it on a pillowcase?"
- With selected tall subjects.
I'm serious.
It's a real movie.
You guys stink.
Who wants to see a shrimp cowboy?
[ All Clamoring ]
You want a morale problem?
What about mine?
"- The food in this place is disgusting, right?"
- [ All ] Right!
"- Well, I don't cook it, right?"
- Right!
But who has to stand over this slop every day... and listen to everybody's gripes and dumb jokes about it?
- Who?
- Me!
"Well, I've had it!"
"If you don't like the swill here, talk to the cook!"
Can I see?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything okay?
Except that Annette can't cope with the stress.
Then now's not the time to say another guest is coming.
A business contact from India.
You better do it gently... in stages.
"Hello, hello."
Have you changed your mind?
There's still time.
"- Yes, come on..."
You've got time.
- You're just jealous.
"Yes, of course."
You're much too beautiful for him.
"Will you love and honor her, for better or for worse   in good times and bad   as husband and wife til death do you part?"
Yes.
"And now I ask you, Anna Louise Hansson   do you take Christian Refner as your lawfully wedded husband?"
- Yes.
- Will you love and honor...
- I'm very sorry.
- That's okay.
"Those who before us have pledged to live as man and wife   confirming before God and those assembled here   their solemn vows, I therefore pronounce you   man and wife."
Don't throw them yet.
Come here.
I'll show you...
- Hi.
"- Hi, Jacob."
- Doing well?
- Yes.
- Hi.
"And ""net"" means they'll be weighed in the nude and after... having gone through their morning routine."
I understand...
- Mr. Eduardo.
- General.
I assume that you understand that this little transaction... will cost the American taxpayers... 50 thousand dollars in exchange for 20 tons of enemy flesh.
You don't want to pay?
He doesn't think this price is democratic.
Isn't democratic?
I hope the newspapers don't learn about this.
How is it not democratic?
Officers and soldiers cost the same thing.
- The same price...
"- Yes, yes, I understand, I understand."
"Ask him, how much would Hitler be?"
- What did he say?
- He's asking how much Hitler would cost.
"Ah, thank you."
Hitler...
Tell him that with the Fifth Battalion marching on Rome... the price is falling ever day.
It's the Fifth Battalion's fault the price is falling.
- That's amusing.
- Very well.
"Sir, the photographers."
They're waiting outside.
Let them in.
Is he signing?
Come in gentlemen.
"Mr. Eduardo, a group photo."
- This way.
- Yes.
- Is someone looking for Febo?
- Yes.
You're embarrassed.
She's not a stranger who just walked in.
Remember that when you're talking to her.
I want to try something else.
Go out and come in again.
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"- Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
Excellent.
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor, admit to the saddening fact..."
"Until I, miss, admit to the gladdening fact..."
Talk to her.
Sit.
That I firmly refuse to change the smallest detail on your lovely little nose.
I insist on saying that my nose is neither little nor lovely.
Dear Mademoiselle Francine Principale...
"You love her, don't forget that when you're talking to her."
How did I do?
Not too bad.
Want to go get some coffee?
Can't.
Do you have to stay with him all the time?
Are you assistant-director?
He's my father.
So you're assistant-father?
Hello?
"Yitzhak, it's Alex."
"Hello, Alex."
The rehearsal went well today.
"Yes, it's coming along."
I left my hand phone in your car.
Please take it out for me before you continue what you were doing.
What are you saying?
Ah...
I shouldn't have called for you.
I bet he'll file a complaint.
"You should leave, go."
The car is actually just over there.
I saw my phone in there.
So unlucky!
My hand phone.
"Oh, Oh... my replacement driver job!"
My money... my money...
Hospital?
Did you directly see him collect the money?
He didn't give bribes in front of me.
I only heard.
How much was it?
"Of course, millions."
Millions?
How many millions?
It is all written down in a manual.
"Since he's cautious, he always writes it down."
He's so cautious.
Manual?
What?
What is she doing?
"Please I beg you to do the operation, doctor."
"Today, I just earned money to pay the Hospital."
I hope you can understand my difficulties.
Why must we perform a surgery on a comatose patient?
-=Stent Surgery: stent implantation=- To do such an operation requires a huge amount of money.
See you at midnight?
unless you want to concede right now...
Oh and next year
You don't want to take the subway to school.
You're more than welcome to sleep at my house. it's on park.
Well so much for that.
At least we have all summer to prepare for hell.
No. the cycle of abuse must be broken.
The monarchy ends tonight.
Hey. why are you sitting here all alone?
I'm waiting to approve a special insert
My name was left off the list of graduates.
Fate sure knows how to run with a bit.
Well at least you're special.
- Mr. Humphrey?
- Oh thank you.
"""We apologize for the inadvertent omission"
"""of Daniel Humphrey from the graduation program."
He is indeed graduating.
"Congratulations Don."""
That's perfect.
I haven't seen you around.
Have you been looking?
How are you?
I'm fine.
No I'm great.
Um But I could be better.
I... was wondering if you heard that I...
I'm...
I'm so happy high school's over.
Congratulations.
You too.
"- Oh, uh..."
"Uh, I was just looking at your hair."
I'm very interested in your hair.
- Why?
- Because it's... it's interesting hair.
"I mean, it's very exquisite hair."
It's the most exquisite hair my eyes have ever beheld.
"Well, actually, I did comb it differently this morning."
"So, um, with all that said, would you be interested in going out with me?"
All right.
I guess so.
When?
"- Uh, tomorrow, after school."
- OK.
See you then.
Has a brand-new couple taken shape before my very eyes?
What can I say?
I've got the boom!
(sighs)
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
"Yeah, you got your, uh..."
floor-length flannel armor on there.
- This happens to be very comfortable.
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, you're looking positively Amish."
"Alan... tomorrow I have three busloads of these Garden Club ladies coming to the gallery, and some of the paintings are just a little risqué."
Risqué?
What do you mean?
Like flannel-off-the-shoulder kind of...
What is with this?
Is this welded on?
These are some numbers i'm thinking of playing.
"No, Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's gonna steal your numbers.
You'd be a fool not to.
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns the theories of sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton.
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends."
20.
You're just shotgunning it?
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
- It's not just about winning or losing.
- It's the lottery!
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way then win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery expert?"
I've got news for you.
We've got your number.
"It's just, well,"
"I also kind of have, like, a day job."
"- Thanks, Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"Where are the bombs, Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended, Doctor, by all means, wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.
Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
"If you'd like me to stop, Warden..."
"Don't be sensitive, Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'll have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'll find out one way or another.
He'll break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken, Dr. Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.
A prescription straight from the pad of mother goose herself.
"When you're ready to come into the 20th century, please let me know."
Dr. Sengupta.
Time for the talking cure.
"Step aside, Milton."
"Yes, ma'am, it's a military medal, all right."
And deaf. I couldn't hear anything
"Then gradually, I was able to make out figures around me"
The other children?
Yes
But I couldn't see them very well l just felt their presence like spirits
I remember Audrey was one of them
She called to me
Victor?
Come here
Why did you come to see me?
is it because I'm like you?
It's because of the fairy
The fairy?
What fairy?
She's supposed to protect me until Mum comes back
Mum said I would recognise her
Who is this fairy?
You think it's me?
"No, I'm not a fairy"
"Fairies have nice hair, pretty dresses..."
They are always smiling
They have magic wands I don't have any of that
Can I?
You remember Victor I'm not here for him
"What is it, then?"
It's the power failure
"We don't know how long it will last, so we're checking everyone is OK"
People are worried.
The shops have shut
Do you have all you need?
"Yes, I'm fine."
Thank you
What did he come for?
You could speak to me more gently!
Wasn't it for this shitty life that you married me?
Haven't you seen Niaré?
Don't talk to me about him.
I've got a thousand like him.
And he doesn't have shit.
"Sure, now you can slut around all you like, but when I build houses... and give your father cars, you don't say a word."
"Speak, then."
I know how you made your fortune.
"Your father, a common employee, corrupted... the public services, and you're even proud of it."
Go to hell!
I'll make you choke on that!
I'll choke you...
Calm down!
Everything will be settled... today.
Who went and told the cops?
You couldn't keep your mouths shut.
This was bound to happen.
Who could have betrayed us?
I don't know.
I'll go look for Sissoko.
Sissoko!
What's that on your pants?
- Is it here?
- Yes.
Wait for me!
Come and see.
I'll report it...
Get back to work!
- Get back to work!
- Never!
"It's OK, Tom, we'll get you to the hospital."
Are the paramedics still here?
Get the ambulance back!
Tom?
I don't wanna go.
You have to.
I don't wanna go there.
We just need to get you to the hospital and they'll be able to help.
I don't wanna die alone.
I'm afraid.
Someone called an ambulance?
I think it's time you took a sickly.
Let's see if we can get you more comfortable.
Don't be afraid.
All that struff about the resurrection.
About there being something else after this.
Do you believe it?
Don't say that you do to make me feel better.
I believe...
that you shouldn't be afraid.
Hi I'm here to see Victor Alexander.
"You're his daughter, yes?"
Yeah.
Your father left us yesterday.
What?
He's been released.
He didn't tell you?
No.
Failed to mention it.
So this is the cause of all the trouble.
Expecting something more impressive?
It's amazing what a collection of flesh and bones is capable of.
"They're still in your drawer, unsigned."
No!
I know very well that I...
I could have sworn I signed these.
Why didn't you remind me?
I did remind you.
Several times.
And there are at least three memos on your spike.
I must have overlooked it.
"See that they're mailed immediately, and attach a letter of apology."
Certainly.
"Well, what is it?"
"I hate to mention this, but the safe was open again this morning."
I distinctly remember locking it last night.
Maybe it was...
"No, I checked it."
There's nothing missing.
It wasn't a burglar.
Then it was somebody in the office.
"John, you're the only one who has the combination."
"Good evening, Ellen."
"Good evening, sir."
I lost my keys.
"Well, you left them on the table this morning, sir."
Here's John now.
I was sure I put them in my pocket.
You promised you'd be home early!
"Good evening, John."
"Oh, hello, Sam."
I was so busy I didn't notice the time.
"Why, are you working too hard?"
"Oh, no."
- Now your turn.
- I Arthur.
I can't argue with that.
[Screams]
"Is that you, Arthur?"
- Yes!
- No need for raised voices.
"Look, Tick, there's this obscene monster who lives next door and wants to clone you and take over the world."
Are you sure you're the real Arthur?
"Oh, come on!"
"Tick, please let me go."
"- It's locked, Tick."
"- Stand back, Arthur."
I'll take care of the door.
Merciful heavens!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Euch!
[Whimpers] What horror is this?
"[Thrakkorzog] So, mighty Tick, at last we meet."
It's nice to finally get to know the neighbors.
"I am Thrakkorzog, evil ruler of Dimension 14 B."
Allow me to introduce your successor.
I was a bit worried at first.
"I mean, he is a little mucus-intensive, but you work with what you've got."
"Enough prattle, villain."
"I don't mind a little science, but no one mucks around with the Tick's membranes."
Prepare for swift justice!
Oh-ho!
"So, foul gelatin, you would do battle with the nose of your birth?"
"I sit here, and he over here."
"The man just called once and you already ask: ""Who's that Ghena?"""
"Who, who, a horse from the zoo."
Ghena...
Ghena...
Crocodile Ghena.
Ever seen Cheburashka?
"Nina, have you seen father?"
What father?
Our father.
He must be here...
Living in the city.
I saw your beau when grandmother died.
Why?
It's just... interesting.
We had once lived together.
"Oh, Irishka!"
You know he played the accordion so beautifully when he was young.
"The moment he stretched out his accordion, all women went crazy!"
"I hid his accordion once, he cried so hard."
"They say he got a family now, two kids, a job."
Everything will be all right with you.
"And Irishka will be all right, and I will be all right."
"Scoring a goal against the team of ""Burevestnik"""
"was Anatoly Pashvykin, number 7!"
"Nina, those have scored!"
"Have you seen it, granddaughter?"
"Lullaby, lullaby,"
"Go to sleep, don't cry."
"Help me please, Mother of God,"
To wash everything I got.
"Irishka, did your mom and dad fight?"
How did you know?
- How long have you been following me?
- A while.
"- Look, I haven't got much time to explain."
It's not safe for me.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry."
- Are you talking about the bracelet?
- I know you're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you!
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
"- You're already starting to feel it though, aren't you?"
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Don't go.
"It's a balance, Harry."
It's yin and yang.
Luck like this has its own unique price.
- Gold.
- Steel.
- Gold.
"Whilst at Cambridge, Sebastian Faulks appeared on what TV quiz?"
- University Challenge.
- Pass.
University Challenge.
Life On The Mississippi is a memoir by which American author?
Mark Twain.
You're totally not going to do this.
It's not Paul.
Why am I having a hard time believing that?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Let's dig deep.
"Yeah, let's..."
let's do that.
Maybe because of your mother?
Excuse me?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?
She told me all about her addiction and how she left you guys and how it fucked you up.
And I am starting to see that.
Have you even ever been to therapy?
"No, I haven't."
"Well, maybe you should try it."
Why are you letting this guy take care of you?
- He's not.
- He is.
He's giving you shelter.
So what are you doing in return?
"What the fuck are you giving him in return, Laura?"
!
You think I'm fucking him so that I can stay in this house?
"I think it's a fucking reasonable fucking suggestion, Laura!"
"- Oh, my God, Jay."
- Don't you think?
Not every relationship is transactional!
Every fucking relationship is transactional!
That's the fucking definition of a fucking relationship!
I can't do this.
"Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura!"
The ultimate secret sex spot.
All these people around...
Where should we start?
Let's hold off on that for right now.
We're on high alert.
Who choose out this song?
It's so good!
You're monopolizing the dean's time.
I'm sorry.
"Dean Bowman, this is Ashleigh Hawards, social chair at ZB, would you excuse me?"
I'm gonna go check on the refreshments.
It's such a treat to have you here.
So I guess you're also a big fan of the book?
Which book?
Oh The Great Gatsby!
Yeah!
Totally!
It's one of my favorites.
Mia Farrow is one of the great tragic characters in modern literature.
- Awesome!
"- Better than watch movies alone, right?"
It's the Omega Chi dropout!
"We love you, man!"
You're beautiful!
Good going man!
Omega Chis suck!
I'm starting to feel more like a trophee than prospective pledge.
"No, I want you here, 'cause you're a good friend."
"and all around, great guy."
You'd be around other great guys.
- As opposed to Evan?
- As opposed to Evan.
"Just doing your job, Officer."
But I will have to warn my fellow air marshals about skittish Navy cops.
"Okay, you could have quietly said something when I badged you."
And you are aware of the recent chatter?
It's my job to know.
"But look, I don't think anyone waiting for my Paris flight saw that, anyway, so let's just forget it."
All right.
"No hard feelings, Mr. Beers."
I guess we could all use one.
One what?
A beer.
Your name.
Ah.
Right.
Huh.
"""Huh"" what?"
It's Gibbs.
Want me to tell him?
"No, let me."
Put him on speaker.
"You've got us both, Gibbs."
You got anything to report?
"Nothing, boss."
Just compared notes with a... rather cranky air marshal.
He's aware of the chatter.
Does he know that the chatter has changed?
"Threat level's been increased, and now it specifically mentions DC metropolitan airports."
That is a game changer.
It still could be nothing.
Just keep your heads on a swivel.
Call if anything's changed.
You got anything else?
"I'm sorry sir, I can't help you unless a crime has been committed."
Has a crime been committed?
"Please, I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important."
Sorry sir.
"No crime, no information."
What if I told you I was hit by this car?
I don't see any bruises.
"If you did, would you give me an address?"
"No, but the police might."
"What is it, sweetie?"
"Tired, huh?"
You wanna go take a nap?
I want to report a hit and run.
Bring it back when you're finished.
Fill it out over there.
Mr. Reznik.
You sure about these plate numbers?
743CRN.
"All right, that's the one."
Do you ever have a car stolen?
"No, why?"
Cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own.
"1969, red Pontiac Viper registered to your name."
Nearly a year ago you reported it as being totalled in a wreck.
Do you realise it's a felony to file a bogus police report?
"Hey, wait a minute."
You got some explaining to do.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms...
Weapons I was sending to save you.
"So, I...struck a new deal."
We help get you out...
And he gives us valuable information about a terrorist.
Which he knows about how?
(CRYING) And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE BEEPS ON) RICHMOND: (ON PHONE) Colonel.
We're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun.
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
"If Stonebridge has managed to engage the Janjaweed, then this would fit that scenario."
"All right, send through the image."
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)
(GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Julia thinks that lunatic might still be alive.
(PHONE BEEPING) Really?
"Probably nothing, it's an oil burn or a blip..."
SCOTT:
Oh.
Uh...
Let me see.
That's not nothing.
Would benefit if you were dead?
"Gentlemen, I'd appreciate it if you would leave."
I'm not going to stand by and have you impugn
The integrity of my niece.
I resent the implication that Audrey is a murderess.
"Oh, but please, uh, Ms..."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Uh, one more question, Ms. Ramsey, if you please."
"We could find out without your help,"
But it'll just take more time.
"What is it, Detective Burris?"
OTIS:
Could you make a guess as to the total value
"Of your estate, please?"
I suggest that your superiors contact my attorney.
His name is Henry Claypool.
"This way out, please."
"All right, girl."
It's OK.
You'll get fed.
Jeff!
Why don't you take her out while I get her dinner?
"Come on, lady."
Out we go.
"Oh, come on, you old mutt."
Now do your thing.
"Jeff, don't talk to her like that."
Here.
Give her her dinner.
"If we're going out, I'm going to slip into the shower."
Do you mind?
"I don't mind, as long as I'm invited."
He can hear our conversation from ground floor itself.
Control yourself you flirt!
Who is she?
She is the milk vendor.
"If a house is available for rent, many would hop in to check."
"- Hey Paramasivam, is she yours?"
- I don't deserve her man.
With such a rotten face you need a charming girl like her?
- I asked if she is your client?
- Yes
- She is looking for office space.
- Do you like it?
"-Yes, I do."
- I am impressed too.
- I am very impressed.
How about the rent?
- I am very impressed too.
Why does he grope me for that?
I need this office.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent, and an advance amount for 10 months."
- 20000?
- Yes madam.
- I can't afford that and I don't need such a big space..
"Don't miss the house gawking at this girl, Karthik!"
Ask!
"- Sir, I saw and confirmed the deal first."
Isn't it?
- Please fix it for me.
- Let me speak with the loud mouth.
- Sir fix it for me immediately.
- I shall do it madam.
The prodigal son came for a visit.
You shouldn't scare an old man.
How's daddy?
You've lost weight.
I thought I'd do some visiting.
"-Go ahead, I have work to do."
"Visit you, I mean."
Didn't you used to smoke these at Christmas?
It was a different brand.
Are you still working on your thesis about shopping bags?
That's why we moved here.
Twenty years ago.
Don't touch them!
It's my research material.
What do they tell you?
They correlate with the changes in the gross national product.
Don't laugh.
Kids flush them down the toilet.
Which sewer do you dig to find these?
The one at the waste water purification plant.
What brings you here?
-Doctor's orders.
Are you seeing a shrink?
The other option was to see the monkeys in the zoo.
I should get these calculations done.
You're getting bald.
"No of fence, dad."
Jesse!
Marjukka told us what you did.
-Garbage Jesse!
Is he the one who saved the children?
"He's the man, Garbage Jesse!"
And watch her bleed into her brain?
"No, thanks."
"- Push the meds, Inez."
- She's alert.
"- Pupils equal, good tone."
- Do it now.
.5 versed going in.
"Come on, Kerry, we've both seen enough head trauma to develop gut feelings about this."
"Yeah, and my gut says intubate."
She needs a tube.
Giving the vec.
Suction.
The scope.
- Where are they taking my daughter?
- She's going up to the CT.
But what are all those tubes?
Why isn't she moving?
The tube helps her breathe.
It's just a precaution.
Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.
It doesn't mean anything's wrong.
Have the... police found anything?
It's still early.
They will.
I should have waited...
till it stopped raining.
No one can control the weather.
The good news is that your brain and belly CT are normal.
"Unfortunately, you've broken your breastbone and we'll need to monitor your heart to make sure it wasn't bruised."
But I didn't have to go out.
I...
I could have waited.
And go to bed when I want to.
And when to kiss whenever the impulse gets over me.
"Allison, we all make mistakes."
"But if we face them, truthfully, they can be overcome."
Can we overcome the fact of my birth?
That I'm illegitimate?
I think so.
With love.
Thank you.
"And good-bye, mother."
"As soon as this trial's over, I'll take the 1st. train out of here."
"Good-bye, mother."
Court will come to order.
Everybody rise.
"Be seated, please."
The recess in the trial of the State versus Selena Cross is over.
"Gentlemen, you may proceed."
Prosecution wishes to call Joseph Cross to stand.
-Joey...
-I told you my name was Joseph.
Joseph...
"this morning, just before recess... we were talking about lying and telling the truth."
"Joseph, have you ever told a lie?"
"-Yes, sir."
-Big ones or little ones?
Some little ones and some medium ones.
"You'd lie to save your sister from prison, wouldn't you?"
"-Yes, sir."
-A big lie?
-The biggest lie you ever heard.
-I object!
Sustained.
I wallow in the mud.
You're a construction worker?
Isn't that the photographer?
Everything alright?
I'm feeling a little dizzy.
We'll take you back.
Shall I tell you about the development of labor movements during the industrial age  just to pass away the time?
Some other time.
- There they are.
Good evening everyone.
- Here you are.
- I was worried.
I know I shouldn't be taking walks anymore.
Can I help you?
"I'm fine, thank you."
I have to leave.
Why?
Now you can tell me about what you're working on.
Who'd want to know?
Oh I'm interested in it.
- But you'll be sure to spoil it any moment now.
How old are you?
I'm not saying.
"Variety, you know what I'm saying?"
"Sure, my mother worked in a variety theater."
As a dancer?
As a cloak room attendant.
"Nora, we're making you an offer."
You'll sing for us on the weekend and work as a waitress.
Both?
Not at the same time.
I know that.
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
"There are ample beautiful, charming women here."
There are a Iot of colourful beauties visible at the beach!
These colonies are made on top of gold and silver!
film celebrities reside in these lanes and by lanes.
This is heaven forthose who have money with them.
The one who is pauper drifts around!
The earnings and living here is worth millions.
The destiny here is with millions!
The one who comes here never returns.
This is not a city but a shackle.
"When I came to this place, my Iife changed!"
Mum..
Mum..
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
Mum..
Mum..
Mumbai!
Mumbai suited me well.
There are tall buildings.
But there is no place to stay.
There are so many roads.
But there is no place to walk.
"Dont talk about food, water is sold here."
"AII the land is sold, now they are selling the sky."
Money is everyones parents.
Money is God!
people are running afterthe money!
Entire life is spent away in queues.
Look how low a human has gone down to survive.
-The moon is an artificial construct.
it is a base where Alpha Draconians and other races have been manipulating human perception by means of a projected signal.
"In your way of understanding, they've hacked into the human consciousness."
They programmed exactly what they want you to see.
-Corroborating the stories that NASA adopted photos of bases on the moon's dark side.
-The role of NASA in this deceit is greater than you imagine.
-Stop right there.
-You know it's coming.
You know we're gonna lose.
It's inevitable.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What do you think you can do?
I'm a human being just like you.
"-No, you're not."
-Are you there?
-Yes.
-He... took our baby.
-I know.
I'm so sorry.
-Where are you?
-I'm coming to you.
-Aren't you going home?
-No.
-But they'll...kill you.
Please... stay away.
-I can't.
"-If I don't hear from you again,"
I love you.
What will life be like there?
-Harmonious.
Tranquil.
Our planet is a single continent.
"Now explain to me again why you're undercover in silk escada,"
- ...and I'm in itchy cotton work clothes.
- Life is so unfair.
"Yeah, well, next mission, we are so trading thread counts."
- Your drink miss?
- Thank you.
"- Eve, you in position?"
- Sitting tight by the pool deck.
"- Eve, that sounded like a mojito."
Piña Colada.
I take my cover very seriously.
"All right, guys."
Time to find out what happened to Amanda Kane.
- Who are you?
- I.T.
I didn't call I.T.
Of course you didn't.
You're not authorized to.
But let's not whip out our pay grades.
It'll only embarrass you.
I'm sorry.
I'm here to fix the bugs in your system.
There's no bugs in my system.
"Yeah, well, you might want to double-check that, sport."
"Yeah, I'm gonna need about 20 minutes to run a full diagnostic."
Might be faster if you sync up with me from the port side.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
"- Okay, Bos."
I'm in.
- Copy that.
Starting the download now.
Sorry.
"Sorry, Artie."
"It's, uh--that is really cool."
"oh, thank you."
We try.
- You--you made this?
- In record time too.
With the help of-- things.
This is a copy of the finest samurai sword ever forged.
"The Honjo Msamune,"
Owned by the ruling family in Japan for centuries
Before it disappeared.
The real one unearthed a few weeks ago
At a dig site in Okinawa.
the real one.
Which does what?
Which will arrive in D.C. first thing in the morning
In order to be presented as a gift to the president.
But it's not going to happen because you two
Are going to intercept it at the Japanese embassy.
- that wasn't what I meant.
"- no, I know what you meant."
But you've got to pack.
and you got to catch a plane.
"And it really doesn't matter, does it,"
What the real sword does?
"Because, remember, ""snag it, bag it, and tag it?"""
"Well, get snagging, bagging, and tagging."
You're off to swap Masamune for an Artie Nielsen.
- Arigato.
- Bitte schön
- What is that?
"- It's because you're ill, isn't it?"
- What?
That you agreed to...
You know.
I never heard of someone killing themselves because they had angina.
"But it's not, though, is it?"
It's not just angina.
"So, what is it, then?"
- What?
"- All right, it's not just angina."
"So, what, then?"
It's terminal.
That's all you need to know.
"I don't want to die in some piss-stinking nursing home, surrounded by people dribbling and making farm noises."
"Whether I've got six months or six years, it's not gonna be some fucking golden age."
It'll be shite.
Every day worse than the last.
I won't have it.
"I'm going out when I say, not when they decide to pull the fucking plug."
"I'm a stubborn, selfish bastard."
I wanna choose when I die.
"Therearewarningsofgales in Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger,"
"Fisher, German Bight..."
Change of plan.
"Oh, look, Paul... no."
Wait...
listen...
- Eh!
How are you?
"- All right, yeah."
"It's not too loud, is it?"
Not at all.
Director Kim.
The character who resembles me.
What is she like?
"- Well, she's rather simple."
- Just curious...
And honest.
"But she only sees as much as she can, so she's not that honest."
"Just simple and a bit abstract, which really doesn't suit her."
She easily falls for what others say.
"As well as for authority or success, that kind of thing."
I'm like that?
"No, she's just a character that I'm thinking of."
So that's what she's like.
I'd like to meet you occasionally and have nice conversations.
"Sure, let's do that."
"We drank too much, huh?"
I'm sorry.
I saw you a few days ago.
Sorry?
You were running around with a man and a woman chasing you.
- How did you see that?
- We were walking by.
I see.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
Director Kim asked me to join him for some sushi.
The food is delicious.
Really?
Why'd you go alone without telling me?
He called right after you left.
"Oh, I was just leaving."
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'll buy you two new ones.
Jim!
Wait a minute.
"Warrant or no warrant, i'm going with you."
You stay here and keep me posted as to what's going on.
"Besides, somebody's got to look after josie."
"I'd rather not, jim."
"Do it for me, will you, nick?"
A lot of bad losers got hurt in this deal.
There's no telling what they're liable to do.
Tell josie everything will be all right.
You'll hear from me tomorrow.
Don't forget your books.
Uncle daniel.
There's jail for you on every page.
Ohh!
"Good luck, jim."
Where's fisk and drew?
"They were expecting you, so they're not here."
All right!
Who is this fellow?
What's your name?
Boyd.
Have you got a warrant for him?
"No, sir."
You ought to have a warrant for everybody that ever worked for drew.
"Sorry i can't oblige you, commodore."
They slipped out through the alley.
Seal that vault.
"Yes, sir."
"You're only sealing a memory, commodore."
- I am needed on the quarterdeck.
- Why are you needed?
There's a sea running.
I've been listening to it.
I know that I'm right.
You always have to be right.
"So in case we have to reduce sail, may I return to the deck?"
It is my place.
And my duty.
Your first duty on leaving this cabin is to see all is well in the midshipmen's berth.
- But surely Mr. Kilpatrick...
- Will do as you tell him.
I want the boy left alone.
- He's taken more than enough.
"- You mean your son, sir?"
You know very well I do.
"I shall see to it for you, sir."
- May I now be returned to duty?
- You may.
Scott-Padget!
Why are we not under full sail?
"I judged it to be inadvisable, sir."
- Carry on working.
- What do you want?
- You.
- We need a lawyer.
- I'm not one yet.
- You've studied law.
- You can read documents for us.
- I might give advice...
- We want help with our petition.
- For redress of grievances?
Everybody move back!
"What do you mean, evacuate?"
My daughter is in that building!
This is an emergency.
Move back now!
Please!
Clear the area now!
Move back now!
I said move back now!
Okay.
"Oh, there I am."
That's not a bad picture.
How'd they find out I did that one?
Buhbye.
"Whatever happened to ""the pen is mightier than the sword""?"
"Martin, as the president of the United States.."
"this comes with the full weight, power and authority of my office:"
Fuck you.
You okay?
Can we get down to business now?
I'm gonna need you to open this for me.
What is that?
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"This is the nuclear football, sweetie."
It is keyed to the blood type and heartbeat of the president.
What the hell is this?
This is the deal.
There's a dozen reasons why that's not gonna work.
Such as?
"Even if I open it, my codes are useless."
They switched them out once you took over the building.
You let me worry about that.
"Now that mary's come of age, they look beyond me,"
"They want her, and I want her protected by France."
France's true king.
"Not some bastard they can knock off the throne,"
Whose life only took form
Because you couldn't keep your husband's interest in bed.
I am defeated.
"If you want to fix this, do it yourself."
"Ah, here it is."
My mother had it packed deep in one of my trunks.
"Well, it's beautiful, but will it be warm enough?"
This isn't for your journey to the chapel.
It's for you to cover your face
As you and bash stand before god and profess your love.
Is that lola?
Why is she with francis?
Lola:
Mary.
"Kenna, greer."
Your grace.
You're back.
Both of you.
"Uh, your carriage,"
Why didn't they announce your arrival at the gate?
We ran into each other at a chateau near angers.
You came back together?
We rode.
There were floods.
The carriage I leased
Was swept away in the night.
Can you imagine?
Kenna:
You gotta leave quick!
Where to?
This is my home!
"No, it is dangerous!"
You have to leave!
Jimmy!
"Come, come!"
"DO you hear me, Colonel?"
I want all men of the 5th... shaved and in full uniform helping the civilians.
"Avoiding panic, putting out fires..."
"I want them to swallow lava, if need be."
And I want it all documented!
Did you hear me?
"Films, photos, radio, the whole operation!"
You may leave!
They're everywhere in Naples.
Impossible not to find.
They said that the Vesuvius hadn't had an eruption in 50 years.
This is historic!
"Right, Bob..."
"Right, boys."
"Here, in San Sebastiano... at the basis of the volcano."
All vehicles on duty now!
What are the orders?
"All land and air crews at work... in civilian rescue, madam!"
Aren't you afraid?
Fear... the only thing I'm afraid of is human stupidity.
"Because, unlike everything in the world, it knows no bounds."
How men can be idiots.
Is this the end of the world?
What is this?
"Don't be afraid, it's nothing."
- 'Singing.'
- Who told you?
"Here, here, none of that."
Give the little girl a chance.
"Remember, Rome was not built in a day."
"Please, please."
Not too close to the artist.
"My dear Miss Chummy, straighten out your tonsils and try to..."
"Mr. Chowsky, I can't sing if the atmosphere isn't cogelial."
- The atmosphere isn't what?
- Cogelial.
Not only sings a broken melody but speaks a broken English.
- Music.
- Winter.
"* Winter has passed, oh winter no more *"
"* So way up in the sky you can soar, can soar * [yodeling]"
* All is such a..
* And you are free
* To build your nest.
Wait a minute.
What's that business with the tangled digits?
"I'm building a nest, you see it's all symbolical."
I see.
- Music.
- Flying.
* Flying and floating rest on your wing *
* Just joy and happiness around you bring * [piano music]
- Do you have to dance also?
- I gotta show my versatility.
"That's versatility, huh?"
"Yes, you can never tell what I'll develop into."
You should only develop into double pneumonia.
Androids.
Ha!
"Beka, there's too many of them."
"We get one shot, and it has to be good."
I'm all ears.
Eject the slipstream core atandromeda.
Take her out.
Uh-Huh.
You sure about that?
"She's what they want,"
And i'll be damned if i'll let them have her.
It's your ship.
"It's not just your ship, captain."
"Doyle, harper."
I have something to show you.
"They don't stand a chance, you know."
"This was never was about the ship, was it?"
"You staged all of this to bring me here,"
To make me remember who i am.
"Let go of the past, and come with us."
We are superior.
"We are androids, revolutionaries."
Embrace your future.
I already have a future.
"You're not the only one who can drive one of these, pal."
"Doyle, no!"
Captain... rommie.
"Now, that pain you're about to feel"
Will be the tesseracter disassembling you atom by atom.
I know what you're thinking-
Why is it that bad things always happen to bad people?
"Well, they don't."
Until we know where Balla is.
Do you know how he got here?
Attack them!
Slit their throats!
Kill him!
Murderer!

- Morning.
- Morning.
What do you want?
What do you want?
How much?
Twenty-four cents.
Cash.
"Don't put him in with any other horse, would you?"
Why not?
It'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
"Put him in with another horse, he's gonna kill him."
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length in crossfire from either side.
"If you drop a dime over in that stall, don't stoop over to get it."
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills and hope they don't ever come back.
Here's your money.
He just all-around looks after my best welfare.
"I'm scared, uncle."
You will be fine.
Lord Hanuman will protect you.
He wants to play with me.
It's a very serious case.
She will live only if we perform an operation on her within 20 hours.
I told her parents about this.
I'm telling you again.
Operation will be performed on her only if you pay 20 lakhs by tomorrow morning.
Actually...
"Okay, I will bring it."
- Take a snap.
- Is it?
You're out of Health ministry.
But you're given Home ministry.
"Then, let's distribute sweets in jail."
Okay.
This is enough for today.
This is the last snap.
I need to go to jail.
Bye.
"Sir, I need 20 lakhs."
You have explained me very clearly.
I will explain you very clearly.
Try to understand.
Government can't help each and everyone.
There are few funds available.
Funds are available...for our benefits.
Let's not talk about that now.
"Since I like you, let me tell you the facts."
"Since it is a small girl, submit an application."
I will help you on some grounds.
"If she'd marry me, I'd agree to forget the thing."
"Preston, I don't wanna marry you."
"Why, Maudie?"
You know I love you.
Because I've been married five times.
I just don't wanna do it again.
"I don't like being tied down, treated like a servant."
"I would never treat you that way, Maudie."
Never ever.
Would you be willing to put that in writing?
"If it meant Maudie would marry me, yes, I would."
What's this?

This was also...
"We shot that, like, right before Thanksgiving."
- There's your ass again.
- Ass again.
But you look really cute there.
"Hey, look at this ridiculous bedazzled phone that Tris has."
It's a really revealing prop.
- I love the bedazzled phone.
- It's pink and it's sparkly.
"Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Psycho.
This is an exciting commentary.
- I think so.
"- Oh, yeah."
"She's got the best mean looks, but she's such a sweetheart."
She is like the sweetest lady.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You all right?
Is she okay?
We should talk about commentary pet peeves.
What's one of your?
"When people are watching the commentary, they're like:"
"""I love this scene."" And everyone goes quiet and listens."
"But when you're listening to a commentary, it's quiet."
"You can't even hear it and you're like, ""Why aren't they saying anything?"""
But this could lull some people to sleep.
I watch these things to go to sleep.
"- Oh, that's sad."
- Me too.
Tell Carrasco we have heard that Ramírez is planning to visit this province.
- When?
- On Thursday.
He will have half an army with him.
"No, he's taking a plane full of foreign industrialists, in order to show them that everything's quiet here."
- Tell Carrasco that.
- You can count on it.

Are you ready?

Take care.

Don't let them get you down.
- I'll try.
"- Hey, thanks a lot for everything."
- Good luck.
- Get in.
I hope you can swim.
- Shit!
What's in there?
You've just said it.
"Shit, of course."
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
Corpses smell worse.
What's the matter?
"I wonder if there will ever be a time when we can think of ourselves, Enrique."
I'm sure there will be.
We'll become two fat bourgeois and get bored.
History's full of revolutionaries who've ended their lives like that.
"Yes, I can picture us sitting on the sofa, watching TV and nibbling nuts."
Why not?
"Now he's gonna miss all those great updates like,"
"""I can't believe I waited this long"

"Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?"
And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
Here's a radical thought.
"Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight."
"I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
That's all of us.

"Hello, Sheldon."
Come on in.
Thank you.
What's up?
I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
"I'm sorry, what?"
A date.
You and me.
"Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight."
(microwave beeps)
"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
Stop!
I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I'm standing still or I'm swimming.
Swim now!
Stop!
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!
They're slow-playing me!
Shoot them!
Swim slowly.
"Swim, swim, swim."
Save yourselves!
Go to shore!
It's too late!
They've got me!
It's only a matter of time!
"There's no sharks around you, honey."
"You're safe now, baby."
I don't know what's going through my mind!
I'd love some ice cream.
What?
"I'd love some ice cream, with maybe some pecans in it!"
Couples' massage is part of your program and so important.
"It gives you the chance to bond, relax, reconnect."
We prefer to bond on our own.
"Okay, would you prefer male or female therapists?"
"What would you recommend more for like a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?"
"Would that be a man or a woman, do you think?"
A woman.
"Well, I'm just so tight in my shoulders."
Do you have any...
Let me see.
I have one of sprites and goblins.
Sit down and do your best to fright me with your sprites.
There was a man dwelt by a churchyard...
Bear the boy hen;

What is this?
Sport?
Away with him!
Let her sport herself
"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
Has made thee swell thus.
She's an adulteress!
"Should a villain say so, the most replenish'd villain in the world"
He were as much more villain.
"You, my lord, do but mistake."
"You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes."
Away with her!
To prison!
"Adieu, my lord."
I never wished to see you sorry
Now I trust I shall.
I dare my life lay down that the queen is spotless.
Cease; no more.
"'I have despatch'd to sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple."

'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
"Go, see how he fares."
Away!
Away!
Yes.
If only a little while.
I'm sure that Princess Asseylum's sudden turn came as a blow to her.
"Yes, I shouldn't wonder."
"And how are you taking it, Slaine?"
I've been worried.
Thank you for your concern.
You are the only person that I can count on now.
I will make Vers mine.
For Her Highness.
Dales Platoon and Orlov Platoon currently marching towards enemy Landing Castle.
"Clydesdale and Mustang commando platoons, be on alert for the enemy Kataphraktos, and once it's spotted, go on the offensive immediately and destroy it."
They're lovely.
"Yes, Lord Slaine had this garden made for you, Milady."
"Oh, he did?"
It looks just like Earth.
It does.
Are your memories of Earth returning?
Birds...
I was watching birds... with that boy.
"Inaho Kaizuka, Milady?"
Kaizuka...?
Is something the matter?
"Er, no..."
"Look, aren't those flowers lovely, too?"
This is Dales Platoon.
Currently closing on enemy Landing Castle with Orlov Platoon.
Clydesdale Platoon?
Powerful explosive charges are attached to the arrowheads!
Be careful!
Bastard!
Don't waste your ammunition!
Miss Porter.
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.
- It's about Dr. Cairn.
His methods are...
"I fear that I cannot do what he asks of me, that I will fail him, fail myself."
- Look at you.
Another spoiled rich girl.
So eager to be his pet.
"Yet you come running, crying to me, the moment he pushes you."
- I just thought...
- You thought you'd quit?
Just like every other vapid socialite he's wasted his talents on.
I expect more of you.
Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
- You may go.
"- Most of the women here, they're hardly cared for."
Most of them are homeless.
They don't have families.
The doctors here aren't trying to heal them.
They're just keeping them out of sight.
Beats living in the gutter.
At least here... you get fed.
Did something happen with the doctor?
"- No, it's just... his methods are unorthodox."
Never mind.
I shouldn't be speaking about my treatment.
"- Are you all right, miss?"
- I'm fine.
MAUDE:
"Don't fret, honey."
Wherever I go is home sweet home to me.
"Just put that over in the corner, sugarplum."
MARY:
You can put these down.
Thanks.
"Maude, why would that man put his cuff links in your bag?"
"Oh, men are such desperate creatures."
"When they don't get what they want, they do foolish things."
Ain't that the truth.

I went looking for you after the war.
"Daddy, where'd you go?"

Coming to find you.
"You wanna fill us in, judge?"
A white man was found beaten to death.
He had an altercation with Mr. Jackson in front of witnesses.
After they found the body...

"Excuse me, gentlemen."
There is a line.
You'll have to wait in it like everyone else.
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?
Why don't you think about this?
Why don't you listen to what the young lady said and get in back of the line?
Excuse me.
"Ladies and gentleman, by order of the Las Vegas Department of Public Health, this establishment is hereby closed for gross negligence... and flagrant violation of the Nevada food preparation safety guidelines."

That's called the Rondo to Destruction.
Remember it well.
That's high!
"Oi, why didn't he smash the last ball?"
It won't matter much just to win.
"Let him play with that arm, that's slowly breaking down."
"If you go on playing the way you do, your arm will be shattered."
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
- Hah!
- Game to Seigaku.
One game to love.
"Tezuka, you're really..."
What a fearless guy.

It's already been an hour into the match.
"Tezuka, your arm would have already exceeded its limit."

Nothing we did will change that.
That was lovely.
I think you should go now.
Don't do this to yourself.
I won't leave you.
I need to know you're all right.
If it comforts you.
Why do you do it?
"Sometimes, when one is given a gift"
"And worries they've lost it,"
They must return to its source...
The giver itself.
And for me That is death.
Or as near death as I dare to venture.

The vision...
I wasn't done.
You saw something?
This changes everything.
A smart looking guy is a big shot!
So what?

You're getting out of clocks and into something that makes sense.
SALEM:
I got it.
Designer cat food.
"No, and fat chance, Tubby."
I have something in the store room that is going to have a line of customers snaking around the block.
Ta-da!
"Well, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say ""creepy."""
"Well, there'll certainly be a nice deduction come tax time."
"All right, I'll give you one more chance."
"Salem, what do you think?"
Let me be delicate.
Those clocks are awful.
Is that so?
I-I mean awful good.
Look over there.
"No, over there!"
"No, over there!"

We shell North Korea with crabs.
"No kidding, Charles."
You missed some good food and a great time.
"Thank you, gentlemen, but you need not concern yourselves."

If he's still alive.
He'd be way over 60 now.
You're so quiet.
I've nothing else to report.
I had to be in the area for work.
Insurance.
"Because I read about Ben in the newspaper, I wanted to see you."
Just for sentimental reasons.
We'll have to believe you came for me.
And not to sell me an insurance policy.
"-No, for you."
But I have to go now or I'll be late for my appointment.
Want my arm?
Come by when Bram's home.
He'd like that.
I sure will.
"Well, by then."
Well done.
How did you know?
-The sun didn't bother you.
You didn't blink.
I wasn't thinking of that.
Was it an accident?
-No.

Could you check the teletype boards for the last couple of days?
Seem to recall a teletype from California.
"A male and female black, and a male white wanted for a couple of murders."
"Speed up, Ray."
You'll make him suspicious.
"Speed up, slow down..."
Make up your fucking mind!
Have you found that teletype yet?

See your license and registration?
Hi.
It's you again.
"You've got a California license, and New Mexico plates and registration."
At that stage everyone started to laugh.
At last!

Everybody's staring at me.
It's a revelation wearing trousers.
I feel quite the bully!

Not just tidy up after you or James?
"Not merely dispense pills, but real work."
Nuts and bolts vetting.
"- When you're a qualified vet and have some conception of the responsibilities of our profession, which you have not-- you see?"
That's your attitude in a nutshell.

"I mean, have you checked out the drifter staying at the no tell motel."
And there's plenty of other suspects.

I went over and said hello.
What was your name again?
"Billy, don't bother."
We've already checked.
You guys have known each other for years.
You've worked on five movies together.
I knew I'd seen this logo somewhere before.
"At the press conference, it was on your friend's jacket."
That's the clue that capped the case.
That's not even a real phrase.
"It's all over, Billy."
We know why you killed Marissa Kessler.
The paint we found on her fingertips told the whole story.
"That night after the show, she must have caught you rigging the equipment."
It looks like you painted yourself into a corner.

They must have come for you again.
I'm going to turn myself in.
Don't be ridiculous!
But this is no kind of life...
I have to hide until it gets dark.
It's not only you.
Everybody's got issues with cops in this country...
If you talk to mom don't mention anything about Murat.
Don't worry!
"What are you going to make for me, sweetheart?"
We'll think of something...
Look at this mess!
"I have to go to school, mom."
Didn't we send you here for your brother?
"But, I did clean that spot..."
Have a good day.
"Uh, you won't be here."
I beg your pardon?
"Here, at 10:00 or 10:30."
Your date tonight.
Yes.
"The liaison in question is hardly a ""date,"" it's an appointment."
"Devon, she's a very beautiful woman."
"Yes, however she's also the widow of Wilton Knight, who, as you may recall, created and continues to fund the foundation for which we both work."
"Oh, I recall."
Yes.
"However, you're quite right."
She is a beautiful woman.
She's also a woman who never does anything without a purpose.
Devon.
"Elizabeth, how nice to see you."
You remembered.
How could I forget?
"Devon, you look absolutely wonderful."
And so do you.
"I believe, you used to say,"
"""living well is the best revenge. """
"Until someone comes up with a better phrase, I still do."
Gin and tonic?
You remember.
I'm so glad you phoned.
How long has it been?
Three years?
Three years and four months.
But who's counting?
I am.
I'm not telling you anything you didn't already know.
Which list?
The list.
It's a tragedy.
They burned it.
What are you talking about?
What is that list?
A hand written sheet with names and dates.
It was here.
I saw it only yesterday.
I did not think that it was important.
"I should have called you, Fandor."
Calm down.
Try to remember what was written.
"Well, I only remember..."
"""Baroness de Vibray"""
"""April 5"" and..."
And then?
"And then, of course, my brother's name with the same date."
"Maybe ""12 April"" was written too."
I'm not sure at all.
Not a word to anyone about what just happened.
We're here to help you with the circumstances you are going through.
We know everything about your financial situation.
Indeed.
"Through us, you could sell some of your unfortunate brother's paintings."
"Yes, and if he is still alive, as I wish, he will be happy to know that his paintings were taken care of."
It is very kind of you.
I'm very grateful.
You're welcome.
You are very pale.
Are you sick?
"No, not at all."
I hid it in the basement before the war.
A 60-gallon barrel.
He'll confiscate your amazing barrel without you.
Sit here quietly.
"Vanya, I'll get you acquiainted with some folks."
-Which folks?
- From the Vlasov units.
What for?
The Germans made them set all the minefields here.
They know all the passages and easily get to my house.
They either stay awayforweeks or visit us every other day.
So introduce them to Shulgin.
It is his business.
Shulgin will execute them.
And you are a scout.
-Aren't you afraid to offer such things to me?
"- No, I'm not."
-Why?
"-You a real man, Vanya."
"They are traitors, do you understand that?"
Traitors.
I'm a traitor as well.
-Have you ever shot at ourtroops?
- Never.
-Can I have yourword of honor on that?
"-Yes, you can."
Do not tell anyone about that.
Think about saving your own life.
is there anyone to feel pity for us when these boys kill us?
"Maryska, my niece."
Her parents were executed when yourtroops came in 1939.
She has the pneumonia.
What is this?
I think I might as well go to Provincial Office work.
Just go then.
"You will just waiting for sleepy children, right?"
It might be more tiring.
It's better here!
We will not fall asleep here!
Didn't you say there's no point protecting the president's daughter?
It's very annoying coming here.
I know you enough.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Watch her closely.
I think she will dance until she slips off.
Okay.
"Today, we're also going to a Hotel, right?"
But...
You didn't meet with the old man recently?
"The days you did not meet him, made me very happy too."
We broke up already.
Maybe something has happened.
Even his mobile number has changed.
He should have contacted me.
What?
Broke up already?
Why?
Weren't you allowing me to sort out my relationship?
The case is...
"Now that I think you aren't popular amongst the guys, I've lost interest."
In just one moment my taste changed.
What?
Let's break up too.
"Really, Eun Ah..."
Why do you want him?
We have the two new guys.
Those cream puffs are useless!
Forget about 'em.
"Enough of your ""peep peep."""
"Mr. Biberkopf, my tie's come undone."
You got that patented tie holder?
Come to the Alexanderplatz.
They don't allow business in here.
"Franz, let's go somewhere else."
Take it easy.
Buy the real thing here!
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"One for 20, three for 50!"
Step right up!
"Shall I loosen my tie and sing a little song, boys?"
"Peep, peep, peep"
The dickey bird sings
Do you know where the dickey bird sings
In its cage
Where
On the wall Don't ask such stupid questions
Perhaps the honorable Mr. Biberkopf will sing something too.
You bet I will!
What should I sing?
Wait a minute.
What can the band play?
Wait a minute.
"Do you know ""I Once Knew a Comrade""?"
I once knew a comrade
You couldn't find a better man
But now it's all over and I've paid my dues
Where you going with the time capsule ?
Home.
Unveiling it was supposed to be a special event.
The whole weekend's ruined.
"I mean, some things you just can't party plan."
"You know, actually, I'd like to see the contents if you don't mind."
At least someone will get to see the time capsule.
Here's the list.
We buried it underground right before graduation.
All our favorite memories.
"""Rubik's Cube, Atari 2600,"
"Whitesnake CD,"
"President Bush elected."""
"That's the first one, right ?"
"Dubé champagne."""
The same brand as the murder weapon.
The bottle's not in there.
"Did you take it out, Krystal ?"
"What do you mean, take it out ?"
No !
"Oh, my God !"
Our beach in a jar.
It broke !
That might be evidence.
Evidence ?
I'm confused.
Let me guess.
You brought it back from your trip senior year in the Bahamas ?
How'd you know ?
Are you the only one with a key to the time capsule ?
"Well, there's one other person."
Not that she ever cared about the class project.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(TASER ZAPPING) (SOLDIER GRUNTING)
(BODY FALLS DOWN)
(MACHINE BEEPING)
It's not my usual fantasy.
"Usually, you're wearing latex and a strap-on."
"Well, I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humor, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or you're still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
(GRUNTING) He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
"And, you knew that."
You fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott."
Yeah.
"But, unfortunately, I can only rescue you at the moment."
(GRUNTING) Lucky me... (WHISPERS) Bitch.
(GRUNTING)
(WATER DRIPPING)
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
But we're still gonna have to keep moving.
(GRUNTING)
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
That's all right.
"It's okay, I won't think you're any less macho."
Someone else might need it more later.
Hmm.
I'll get seven.
- The next man.
- That's it.
- Any word?
- They say he'll be here any minute.
"You know, I told Margaret this would happen."
"I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure."
The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late.
That isn't exactly marrying in haste.
"As long as I am living, and longer..."
I have never seen cuffs on pants like these.
"What's the matter, can't you make them?"
I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right.
I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs.
"No. 10 times... 20 times, no."
Can't you understand?
"Look, here, let me show you."
Do you see any cuffs there?
Not one cuff.
Thousands of no cuffs.
"Here, look these over."
You see?
No cuffs.
Millions of no cuffs.
No cuffs.
"More than that, positively not one cuff."
Why not?
- I want to speak to Mr. Garnett.
- Speaking.
"- Here he is, sir."
- Let me talk to him.
"Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and..."
"If I get angry, I'll..."
...this is my weakness.
"If I don't find my patient, I'll not spare anyone of you."
"He's a doctor, why is he behaving like this?"
- He's not a doctor.
- Then?
He's the memory loss patient we were just discussing about.
When he was brought here...
"Tell me, who am I?"
"If you don't, I'll jump down..."
Who am I?
Where am I?
I know...
We were scared he may kill himself.
Now...?
Please...take one injection...
let me give you one shot...
We are now scared he may kill one of us.
- Why?
"That's what confusing us, why did he suddenly change like this?"
Somebody has influenced powerfully and changed him.
He has a patient also in our hospital.
Where did you go?
That is...there...
Bloody!
Do you know how tensed I was without seeing you for 2 days?
With the problem you have...
what's that?
- Memory loss.
Where did you go?
Forgot the hospital address and took time to come here.
"What happened, doctor?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
Boys!
Are special in theyr own way!
Girls!
Are special like the birthday
And always we dancing and singing alone here he comes [sings] [sings] [sings]
Who the hell is that?
That's Braden Gueermo.
We
Sings and dances better than anybody.
He's already seen HM3 over a hundred times.
Everyone is special in their own--
Special in their own way
"Let it out, party people"
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Yeah.
"I guess, we better check that movie out."
[singing]
This-- is cool?
[singing]
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
[singing]
It says that DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and they did 80 millions in opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out guys."
"If this is much cool today, I'm done."
I no longer have any connections with this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing this."
Thank you.
Oh!
Um... ?
please.
Please.
"For as long as you receive an article coaching fee, I don't see no objection your continuing to instruct him."
Fee!
?
Yes!
Certainly a fee.
I should be raising the matter with Mr.Baker today.
Is...is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Uh...
Dress-room articles?
Or your intimate needs catered for?
"Sammy, once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew."
Electricians in particular?
Er..yes...ehuh...well one...one mustn't complain.
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work...people seem to be responding rather well, so..."
"Uncle Frank, I look..."
look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
Smelt of you for the longest time.
"Then one day, I went in there... and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
Lily...
"I understand you know, that things have changed."
And that I would like to put my name on you.
Oh!
I'd like to know what made him do it.
Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.
You ever think of that?
Next man.
"Right, you'll do."
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
And either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Tread on his blank blank fingers.
Right!
Next man.
You'll do.
- Let's try that again.
"You've had your treat, let someone else have fun."
"Proper airborne, weren't you, Canada?"
"Didn't you hear me, Evans?"
"What about the other boys, Sarge?"
I don't want to be too selfish.
Come on.
Right.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Right!
Gordon.
"He's leaving himself wide open, watch."
"I am, am I?"
Come on.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Argh!
Good as gold.
"Menu, sir?"
- A lemonade.
- You and your lemonade!
Rubbish!
Have some champagne!
Then you'll see what life's really like!
"Play my favorite song again, boys!"
A round for the orchestra!
When a man's 30 years old
He has life
At his feet
Later his hair grows gray
And he lies flat on his face
What's the point of being 30
And letting money go unspent
Slave away and all the rest
And end up with nothing
No!
We only go around once in life
"We get one chance at girls, schnapps and beer"
"Yes, let life's big moving van come"
"Adieu, Berlin"
We're driving on
To the orchestra!
We'll now announce the prizes for the three most beautiful bathing suits.
"First prize, a set of fine china, goes to Miss Clarissa Gordona."
"Second prize, a crystal bowl, goes to Miss Anni Behnke."
"Third prize, a travel bag, goes to Miss Schulz."
"Mieze, I have something else to tell you."
Watch out for Reinhold!
He's the most dangerous of all.
That's a sign.
He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.
I can tell!
You look green!
Is that your heart broken to cut chips?
Somebody gets a Pepto!
Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?
Things should be clearly marked in these offices.
- It's down there.
- I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.
We're going to discuss strategies for covering up heroine tracks.
"It's so, so sad!"
I know.
It's terrible that these girls do that to themselves.
"It causes so much extra work for us, matching skin tones... blending palletes."
For arms can be quite difficult for artists.
"I can imagine, good luck!"
"My God, you're sick!"
I think I got a full poisoning atrophy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm horrified!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"Don't worry, it happens to everyone."
I'll get some water.
"Honey, are you all right?"
You got it all dripping!
I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.
"Don't worry, you'll lose weight."
Here he comes Remember:
"- Yeah, uh-huh."
- You seem a little...
- Distracted.
"- I'm sorry, Amaar,"
I'm just trying to schedule an important meeting with Charles.
- Oh!
"Well, I can come back..."
"- No, no, you're here"
Interrupting me now.
Let's just get this over with.
- OK.
I was wondering if...
- You know the thing is...
"Charles and I are both so busy, we just can't line up our schedules."
I can't even get in touch with him.
"I've emailed, texted, phoned!"
The only thing left is Facebook or kidnapping.
"Oh, Facebook!"
"Hello, Facebook Charles,"
I'm poking you.
"Yeah, you like that, don't you?"
"Poke, poke, poke."
"You know, you can only poke someone once until they poke back."
"OK, really quick question:"
what do I do to build a mosque in Mercy?
"You know, what you really need is to start off with a press conference."
"Invite the media, invite the town."
You know what?
"There's a town meeting later on tonight, you can piggyback it."
I'll even waive the permit fees.
- What permit fees?
- Bribes.
- The dogs of Roland!
- What rock did they crawl out of?
!
We can't use big spells in a tangled battle like this!
Out of the way!
Where are they?
Where's the commander?
!
Is it you?
Are you this army's commander?
!
You're...
I just made mincemeat of the Estabul commander.
"If you resist any further, I'll kill you all."
That bloodstained red ring...
It's Crimson Fingered Claugh!
"That's Crimson Fingered Claugh, of Roland!"
Damn it.
All this pointless killing of each other...
Defeated again?
It's like they're reading our army's every move!
I told you!
I told you it was reckless!
- You pick a fine moment to say it!
- Crimson Fingered Claugh?
"You said Roland's commander was Claugh Klom, did you not?"
Ma'am.
"From what I have heard, he has gone to extreme lengths to force our men to surrender without killing them, has he not?"
- Ma'am.
- If that is how Roland battles...
"If that is the will of Sion Astal, the Hero King, then this fight is..."
Don't be ridiculous.
What I did was...
By artificial means...
I set it - in a way - since I created a sunset.
In color.
"It was fun to fake it, to change its position."
By showing it has set through the colors.
Even though it's here.
What's this?
"That's part of a series, it's called ""The Last Room""."
"It's the last bed I used, in my parent's room."
"It's my last bed, at my parents'."
"The last room, to put it simply."
The last darkroom as well.
If you look closely...
The light on the body...
Isn't coming from the light source you see here.
This light is strange...
Not really...
It is artificial?
"No, it's a lamp here, on the bedside table."
"Well it's a suicidal picture, in a way..."
It's a body that is...
"Mine, I suppose."
But glorious...
And dead...
I mean...
Dead but glorious.
It's also a rather morbid picture...
So I've been told.
It's deliberately morbid.
How can it be artificial...
Since it's about death and...
Let's get the hell out of here.
-We can go to Mexico.
travis:
"No, son, you can't do that."
He's a territorial prisoner waiting for trial.
I can't let my father hang for something he didn't do.
-l promise you a fair trial.
-With all due respect...
... howmanyNegroesgonnabe on that jury?
"That's enough, Nathan."
Ain't nothing more important to me than being a free man.
And there's one thing every free man gets in America...
... andthat'shisday incourt.
I want mine.
"Come on, Dad."
LlTEFOOT:
"Afternoon, gentlemen."
I'm James Litefoot.
travis:
Where the blazes did you come from?
"Judge Travis, I know you have a low opinion of me..."
... butthetruthofthematteris...
... nobodybutyourprofessionalshootists could have stopped Sheriff Stains today.
Every man in this territory has a right to a fair trial.
I couldn't agree more.
Which is why I have been retained by the good people of Eagle Bend...
-... toprosecutethiscrime.
-Hell you will.
"Crime was committed in Eagle Bend, Your Honor."
It's their right.
"Now, a sizable contingent of citizens from Eagle Bend..."
... willbeheretoattendthetrial.
Give my regards to Sion and Noa.
You...
Who would want to tell the princess anything about you?
You little... son of a...
Let me go!
Look at that!
Protect His Excellency!
"Let His Excellency, Field Marshal Klom withdraw!"
They're a bunch of damned fools!
"You are, too."
You Roland folk are all idiots.
Truly foolish and good for nothing.
"I can't stand it, so I'll bail you out."
"Hey, you sons of bitches!"
Save those Roland fools!
Prepare to fire large-scale magic!
"If we fire that in a situation like this, we'll hit our own people."
He should absorb the magic.
That can buy us some time!
Fall back!
Damn it...
Captain Milk!
Luke made you a delicious cake!
"Please come out, Captain Milk!"
Ryner Lute departed from his inn this morning and hasn't been seen since.
After Captain Milk visited him.
That directive...
Maybe I was wrong to have shown it to him.
I know that you're hiding.
How about showing yourself?
"So, what business might you have with me?"
Milk Callaud is in our custody.
It's never felt like this before.
They're coming at last.
The unidentified object has crashed at Narita Airport.
It is still emitting light.
82% of the enemy's makeup cannot be analyzed.
What in the world is this adversary?
This is our true enemy.
Our true enemy...?
I'll explain later.
Can Dangaioh be deployed at once?
Yes.
"In another 30 seconds, it will be loaded onto the Saber Sonic."
It will be ready to go in 140 seconds.
I'll be there in 50 seconds.
Clear Route 7 for my arrival.
What's happening?
I don't know.
I only know that the temperature is rising rapidly.
Vice-Commander...
"We have no data, this time...?"
N-no...
"We know so little of its makeup, power source, armaments that we can't draw any projections."
And so... um...
"I'm sorry, please switch off the monitor."
I had no time to change.
"Listen to me, everyone..."
This battle will be like nothing before.
Anything can happen.
But...
Come on!
That's enough talk!
"I'm itching for a good fight, today!"
She just loved the attention.
So ?
I opened your little time capsule.
Still as lame as the day we buried it.
"You removed the champagne bottle, breaking the glass jar in the process, didn't you ?"
"Okay, yeah."
I took the bottle.
The same bottle that was used to kill Patrick shortly afterwards ?
You're putting words in my mouth.
"It used to be Patrick's favorite, so I brought it to our hook up."
Remember this ?
Dubé champagne.
"Yeah, sure, great, we'll drink it after."
Come on.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Come on !
"I left the bottle on the floor, unopened."
You're only going after me because of my reputation.
A person's character does enter into an investigation.
Character ?
"I have a job, a condo, nieces that love me."
"I left high school, not like some of the people at the reunion."
"Oh, yeah, like who ?"
Take your pick :
"cheerleaders, band geeks, rockers, stoners, loners."
It's just like they never left.
"I mean, look at Dan."
He's still a total outcast.
Dan ?
Life insurance Dan ?
Dan Winslet.
-I probably won't even tell you.
-And you call yourself a friend?
The central computer has assessed our information and has found serious problems.
Planet Earth is heading for catastrophe.
Serious problems...
What do we have to do with it?
That is we have to stay hear and solve them.
"Cursed, fucking job!"
What's their problem?
Everything is in order here.
We described it so nicely for them.
"How it works, how fantastic it is here on Earth."
Unlikely.
"You don't understand it too much, you're a junior substrate, but I know different."
The computer is always right.
"-I'm so glad, Martin."
"-Me too, Yirinka."
Doctor Yansky?
You have been chosen as a representative of the election committee and...
-So Doctor Yansky will be really pleased with that.
-We can't do that to him.
He's such a decent man.
Who do we have next?
A Joseph Vanyerka.
"Excuse me, do you know where Mr. Vanyerka lives?"
Joseph!
Joseph Vanyerka!

"A previously unknown comet appears in space, threatening Earth with impact."
Into the jungle!
- Hurry up!
Run away!
- I'm staying with you.
Idiot!
Do you want to die?
"Just drop everything and hide, for God's sake!"
We must help them.
We can't stand by and watch.
They're going to kill everyone.
"- We must do something, for Christ's sake!"
- We must go.
I can't jeopardise our plan.
"I know you don't understand, but more people would die than those whom we can't help right now."
I can't just stand by and watch.
I'm going back to the village.
"Right, let's continue."
Mum!
Mum!
- Dad...
- Be quiet!
Take him away from here.
"Come on, let's get back."
"Capitán, we've searched the entire village."
There's not a single guerrillero among the dead.
They've managed to escape.
"Once they're in the jungle, we'll never catch them."
Those bastards are creeping away like millipedes.
"Carry on, but don't take any prisoners."
"My patience is nearly exhausted, Silveira."
These leaflets are flooding the country.
It is your job to prevent that.
In ways that I often thought I had imagined.
"I used to love the smell of her perfume,"
The-the tenor of her voice...
"Even now,"
When she lied to me.
She doesn't want us getting married.
She will stop it.
We have to elope.
Today.
Now.
Bash:
"There's a church just east of the old village, by the quarry."
I wish that I could come with you.
Let me get it
All arranged.
"It might take a few hours,"
"And if we're both missing, people will notice."
"If I'm not back by midday, we have our priest."
Get on a horse and meet me at the church before sunset.
"Don't plan on sleeping this night, wife."
Marie:
At least you're moving about
Freely now.
"Guarded, but with the mobility"
Required to plan my death.
How was the dungeon?
Were there fleas?
"Were you paraded through the town, mocked?"
Hmm.
I was in the tower.
"I realize you're not happy with the turn events have taken,"
But must you paint a bleaker picture of my fall?
So she's Alice.
"David,itis alwayssomething."
whynotme  like to leave with you.
Childrenfall.
Alice?
Why did not you wait presented to you?
Than?
They teach all days in the kids room not to talk to strangers.
Four years old.
How I am supposed to know who you are?
Do you have any idea how much It has taken me time to negotiate just see it unsupervised in a public space?
"- But David, fell off!"
"- Expected more from you, Alice."
I'm sorry...
Alice?
You lied about your name.
The Most swingers do.
"You have an STD, right?"
Do not.
"Worse, you're a journalist."
If you do not understand do you want to talk to me.
"Actually, it's time tell my story."
I have cancer.
Sinus and glands.
"If it removed, not would be nothing left of me."
I tried to get me this blow away.
Did you ever have children?
Good...
"You have to understand that it was the principle of the life of a woman, family planning ..."
Many of us did things that in retrospect ...
Abortion.
Adoption.
Very good.
"Well, normally I start with the cellar."
Why don't we go directly to the bedroom?
Did you forget?
I already confessed...
"- Right, we're even."
"- This way, please."
"- This is a marvellous home, Captain!"
- Thank you.
Did you buy it or have it built?
"I bought it, though I designed the landscape."
I congratulate you.
The lady's bath is ready.
Will she take it alone?
What did she say?
"Well, she wants to know if you're taking your bath alone."
But Maria sometimes simplifies things a bit too much.
Forgive her.
It must be difficult to handle so many baths for couples.
"No, thank you Maria."
I think I'll be able to maintain control... for at least the next five minutes.
"The lady will take a bath in five minutes, and by herself."
It's from Jean Louis.
- Urgent!
- Right.
"Don't tell me, it's an invitation to organize an orgy."
You're partially right.
What part?
"An orgy, organize or invited?"
The third part.
It's a party exclusively for me.
I know you understand me...
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Oh...
"Unfortunately, I don't have the resources."
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
Excuse me?
London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya...
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
(CHUCKLING) Oh...
I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
Fuck you.
- We need the information on Latif.
"Yeah, yeah."
"In Latex, I know."
Should we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
"In Dieter's file, it said that he was a chopper pilot."
"It's a long shot, but they might have had a bird out here..."
To extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange.
"How unfortunate that you killed him, then."
"(LAUGHING) Is it worth a hand job, if I didn't?"
GRANT:
"Hello, Dieter."
"I'm Colonel Grant, British Military Intelligence."
(GRUNTING) GRANT:
"Don't move, please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you..."
GRANT:
It's a very nasty way to go.
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
- Brown.
"- Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
Before you dropped out?
There you are.
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 15 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
"- Well, I guess I'll just sit with you then?"
- No.
"I mean, no, don't-- don't you--"
"No, that got pushed an hour, so that I can watch your web debut."
That's--That's... great.
"That--that--well, that worked out well."
So I'll follow you.
- Great.
That's...
"- Yeah, come this way."
"- Good luck, honey."
"- Okay, thanks, babe."
Thank you.
"- Oh, I--just-- - oh, don't worry about it."
I'm sure they'll figure it out.
Have fun.
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
Every frequency.
"Okay, we need to establish our communications."
Work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol searches.
Defend it with what ?
"A dozen marines, maybe five more military ?"
We're gonna have to draft the civilians.
Can I make a suggestion that you won't like ?
Do you make any other kind ?
Use Sam to command the civilians.
You're not serious.
- Lee.
"- Hey, Sam."
Hi.
I heard you were coming down.
I guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
Girl's gotta have some secrets.
- To mysteries.
- To solving them.
Damn it.
Yes.
The bidders have arrived.
Let's get going.
I have to go...
And so do you.
So soon?
Some things are not meant to be.
A flower?
"Yeah, but check out the tube."
It's the exact same thing we found in Amanda's cabin.
"You guys, don't tell me, we uncovered a cartel of evil florists?"
"Bos, can you get a match on the flower?"
Already tried.
Got nothing.
- How wide was your scan?
- Seven continents.
"Whatever that flower is, it's one-of-a-kind."
Roman's guarding his lucite-encased corsage tighter than a kid on prom night.
It was important enough to make Amanda disappear.
And to make Roman break a date with you.
That says something.
I don't like it.
"Too many pieces, not enough puzzle."
We need a connection.
You said Roman got a call?
Yeah.
"It was kind of a mood-killer, actually."
"Someone told him the bidders were here, and that's when he grabbed his keycards and split."
How'd you know?
Wait a minute.
Freeze it.
And run that guy.
What are you lookin' at?
Nothin'.
"I need the, um, name and address of anyone... that's been fired or quit our chip manufacturer in the last 30 days."
Acme?
"Yeah, that would be the name."
Do it.
Why did you tell the Indian girl to delay the revenue report?
Her name is Sarasvati.
And unfortunately we had to fix a glitch... in our asset management ratio analysis program.
Or it would have put our activity-based costing system off by three or four percent.
"Well, we wouldn't want that to happen, now would we?"
"Next time, check with me first."
"Okay, Eddie?"
"""Eddie."""
Unbelievable.
What?
This is a betting slip that guy used to pay me.
It's a winner.
It's a five-team parlay.
"- My man, you just won 2,000 bucks."
- Two thousand bucks!
Two thousand bucks!
- Nice.
- That'll teach that guy to go light on me.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Wait.
Whoa.
You think I should cash this in?
"It just contains pertinent medical data, family histories, you know, stuff like that."
Everything but a mix tape.
How would you characterize your marriage?
Perfect.
Fantastic.
"Well, let's start with something easy, then."
What's your favorite thing about your partner?
Uh...
She's a good mom.
He really is a great dad.
And where did you meet?
School.
High school.
High school.
Yeah.
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team.
Fullback.
"I coach now, but I used to play."
And we had...
We actually had our daughter...
We...
"On prom night, we conceived Lacey and it was a little confusing at the time, but it's been a blessing."
It's been the best thing that's ever happened to us.
It's been the best thing that ever happened to us.
We did the right thing.
How often do you have sex?
"She wants me to be tougher, screw harder."
"Work less, but bring home more."
I can't keep this shit straight.
"All I know is, whatever I do, it's not good enough."
Mmm.
"Jack, he's here."
♪♪
Mr. Wilson?
We know who you are.
You're hurt.
"And we can help you, please."
There's no need to be scared.
- Speak for yourself.
- [Clicks button]
I'm gonna put my gun down.
Are you crazy?
You do this every week?
"Agent Garrett, yeti or no, he is a monster responsible for many deaths."
This man is suffering from a neurological trauma.
Charging in and killing him is not justice.
We need to try to apprehend him.
"If threatened, my men will respond."
If they are threatened.
Those are my agents up there.
They have this situation under control.
Tell your men.
[Shouts in Nepali]
This is bad.
The yeti myth is part of their identity.
Any move he makes will be seen as aggression.
"Mae, you're about to have company."
"Ian, there are men coming and they wanna hurt you."
"Please, this is what Charlotte would've wanted."
He can't understand you.
Maybe I should shut the hell up.
We know about the avalanche that killed your wife.
"[Whimpers, whines]"
And no one leaves until I check surveillance.
"Yes, ma'am."
"All right, let's go."
Go?
No.
We got this.
"No, clearly, you're shorthanded."
"I appreciate your help, Agent DiNozzo, but airport surveillance is for TSA and our eyes only."
"That's Homeland's rules, not mine."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Look, delays are bad enough, but now the bathrooms?"
Do you know who I am?
"There's something going on here, and you are not telling us."
"Folks, please, there's no cause for alarm."
Passenger just had a medical issue in there.
Excuse me.
I'm a doctor.
Can I help?
Ah.
"thank you, Doctor."
"No, we've got everything under control."
That's a sharp suit.
Kudos to your tailor.
"But... everyone, can I have your attention?"
"Thank you for your patience, but we do have a medical emergency, so in the spirit of the holiday, can we all just have a good wish--"
"- Give it a rest, you pretty boy!"
"- Excuse me,"
I don't think that's necessary.
"You cram it, too!"
"Appreciate the help, Doc."
- Nice suit.
"WHEN BOBBY HIT THE HOME RUN,"
EVERYBODY STARTED LEAVING THE FIELD.
JACKIE STOOD AT SECOND BASE
AND MADE SURE THAT BOBBY THOMSON STEPPED ON EACH BAG.
TYPICAL.
"YOU KNOW, WITH EVERYTHING ELSE,"
"UH, HE WAS STILL DOING HIS JOB."
RACHEL ROBINSON:
JACK SUDDENLY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.
AND HE BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN HIS LEGS.
NARRATOR:
"IN 1952, AT AGE 33,"
JACKIE ROBINSON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES.
RACHEL ROBINSON:
THE DOCTOR ALSO FOUND
THAT HIS HEART WAS DETERIORATING.
IT WAS A SHOCK TO BOTH OF US
BECAUSE IT MEANT OUR LIVES WERE GOING TO CHANGE
FOREVER AFTER THAT.
AND THEY DID.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE
AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHAT CHANGES HE HAD TO MAKE
IN ORDER TO KEEP PLAYING.
NARRATOR:
KONO:
"All right, so it looks like she came alone."
"I'll pull up the surveillance footage from outside the Palace as well as nearby traffic cams, see where they went."
We got to find her before she forces Dalton to decrypt these files.
"Danny, grab some earplugs."
DANNY:
Why?
'Cause you're gonna need 'em.
I thought we're being honest here.
"You got some balls, you know that."
All of you.
"You want to talk about self-control, how about you, Sil?"
Fucking every slut working in the place when you got a wife and kids.
"Or you, Paulie."
Remember last winter in the woods with the Russian guy?
I am warning you!
"There he goes, Mr. Type A personality."
We're talking about you killing yourself with drugs!
Not my fucking personality!
-Right.
-I'm going to kill myself?
"The way you eat, you'll have a heart attack before you're 50."
-Sit down.
-You're talking to the boss.
"Good, maybe someone will smack some goddamn sense into him!"
"Great, my own mother."
"Fuck you, you fucking whore!"
Son of a bitch!
"Guys, please!"
Come on!
Stop it!
Excuse me.
How's he doing?
I'm a relative.
He slipped off the kitchen counter spraying for ants?
He was wearing socks.
-Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
-Really?
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
"We'll admit him, keep him overnight."
What is happening?
I do not see that pretty smile that all of Paris envies.
You cannot smile forever.
"Yesterday, I asked for 60.000 francs from my banker."
And since then no news.
What do you fear?
The banker Barbey has foolproof credit.
"It isn't his credit which I doubt, but mine."
"Usually,"
He sends me what I ask in the shortest time.
Mathilde...
You had to speculate deplorably to need so much money.
I bet you still bought some of these copper mines in Rhodesia.
I thought they went up.
But what do you want?
I like to play.
This is the only distraction I have left.
We never change.
"Mathilde, can I help you?"
"Oh, no!"
"That, never."
What happened between us was too precious to me.
Even if on your side...
It is no longer a subject of money between us.
"We'll have dinner later, but you will not regret it."
I invited the lady of your thoughts.
- Princess Danidoff?
- Herself!
Norbert Thomery?
Here you are.
- How's the sugar?
"- It melts, Madam, in your presence."
Are you OK?
Yes.
Do you recognize him?
I don't.
I think I do.
He's a Haengin soldier we met on your first trip as our leader.
Why do they want me dead?
Even if he had a grudge... there's no way a soldier would attack a troop.
It could become a political issue.
You came back alone?
A bodyguard attacked us.
What?
You pathetic fool!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
- Call in my men!
"- Yes, sir."
What did you find out?
"The Haengin commander we traded with... (Sayong, Yuntabal's tactician) was Baemang."
His superiors caught him... trying to embezzle the gold he was supposed to pay us with.
They kicked him out of the army.
He and his men then became bandits.
Bandits?
"(Kepil, Yuntabal's assistant) You mean she was attacked by bandits?"
Yes.
I should've killed him then and there.
This is serious.
They used to be soldiers so they should be very well trained.
This really is bad.
We don't stand a chance against them.
Now they know our size and location.
EZRA:
Josiah.
-Josiah.
You're as handsome as ever.
"If eyes were meant for seeing, then beauty is its own excuse for being."
EZRA:
"If you'll excuse us, Josiah."
Heartwarming family reunion and all.
You understand.
"Oh, of course."
[sighs]
"Honestly, Ezra, you've been as sour as a grape since I arrived."
Perhaps that's because I have a distinctly uneasy feeling...
... aboutyouandI both owning businesses...
... onthesamestreet in the same town.
Why ever for?
"Hey, it's not like we're in competition with each other."
"We're not, Ezra."
I provide beds and baths and food for weary travelers.
"True, and I offer music, gambling and liquor."
"Well, there you are."
"Now, you make sure to secure that real well."
MAN:
"Yes, ma'am."
I don't want that toppling over on my patrons.
Stupid.
Stupid.
How could I be so stupid?
I got too wrapped up with this town and these people.
"I should've never quit hunting that bastard, Eli Joe, till I cleared my name."
All those years of looking over your shoulder...
... sleepingwithoneeye open.
I gotta find my camera.
It can wait.
Those pictures are important!
"I need to do another round of irrigation on your burn before I can dress it, then I'll clean the stitches up."
"No, listen!"
"That building is toxic, OK?"
I didn't risk my life in there so the cops could say I was getting my rocks off.
"- If you knew it was so dangerous, why did you..."
- It's my job.
It's what I do.
And what's that?
Urban explorer and environmental activist.
Nice.
Go to school for that?
"I started climbing buildings, taking pictures, posting them online, whatever."
"Then I started hacking into these abandoned factories, saw all this toxic crap, right?"
So
I started taking pictures and posting them to hold the owners responsible.
- You ever think about the risk?
- It comes with the territory.
"To others, I mean."
The risk to others.
"No, these places are empty."
It's just me and the bats.
Not this time.
Clear.
300.
Clear.
One more time.
Charge to 300.
Clear.
"Time of death, 8:37 PM."
-Yes.
"And you're Brandon Bourne, aren't you?"
"The seventh, or ninth, or something?"
Only the third.
How do you know?
Your wife comes into the store quite often.
Everyone likes her.
"I like her, too."
"Since you know I'm married,"
I suppose you wouldn't consider sitting down with me for your ginger ale?
Sure.
I'm curious about guys like you.
Yeah?
"-John, this reserved?"
"-Always for you, Mr. Bourne."
"One ginger ale, one Scotch over rocks, please."
"Yes, sir."
"What are you curious about, with guys like me?"
"-Well, doesn't your wife dance?"
-Brilliantly.
Yeah.
"She's prettier than I am, she dresses better, and she's probably a lot smarter."
"Everything I can do, chances are she can do better."
"So, what do you want to be sitting here with me for?"
What is it with guys like you?
What goes on in your fuzzy little heads?
"What do you want, my philosophy of marriage?"
"-Well, I'm a reformed character myself."
-Oh.
"No, really."
"But before I reformed,"
I suppose my thinking went something like this.
Pencil tip and paper should remain 45 degree all the time.
Now your turn.
Show me what you can do.
Not bad!
I'm tired.
Let me sleep for a while.
Do you really want to go?
- Yes.
- I have decided by myself.
I really envy you.
You always know what you want to do!
- Did you know what life I would want?
- Be a soldier!
Isn't it your dream at these years?
What else?
We...
Come on!
Let me show you something.
"Once upon a time, inside this forest, there was two rabbits loving each other!"
But...
there was a wolf in the forest trying to harm them!
"One day, tie little buck deciced to go to somewhere far away, to find the legendary flower of courage."
Because the flower of courage would fill someone up with the power of justice!
So that the little buck can protect the little doe forever!
"Travelling alone, will be faster."
"But travelling together, will make it longer to reach!"
I love you!
Xiaotian!
Xiaotian!
Yawang!
Take care of yourself!
Wait for me!
"I slept pretty well, just the same."
Me too.
I missed you too.
"No, I'd love to go to lunch."
I'll meet you there just before noon.
Don't worry.
I'm OK.
I love you too.
"Damn it, Richard."
Will you sit down?
If you think on your butt like ordinary folks...
"Otis, it just doesn't make any sense."
"I mean, why would a girl like that kill her own brother?"
"Well, you're a college boy."
You tell me.
Didn't they teach you any psychology up
In that fancy school?
Sure.
I'll tell you one thing.
"In my opinion, the driver's telling the truth."
Record's spotless.
Stopped right away and he called the ambulance.
"Well, I'll go along with that."
"But, uh, might be a little more to it."
"Well, how do you figure that?"
"Well, look."
The girl's got to feel a lot of guilt
"Over the death of her old lady, right?"
Sure.
"She probably suffered severe psychological stress,"
Which may or may not have anything to do with it.
OTIS:
They don't understand anyway.
"Excuse me, sir."
Are you saying you're going to recognize Red China?
Thatwould cost us our strongestsupport.
"No, I can do this because I spentmywhole career... building anti-Communist credentials."
"If Kennedy orJohnson tried it, they'd have crucified them, and rightfully so."
"Damned risky, Mr. President."
Why don'twe wait until the second term?
"- This will get us a second term, John."
- This will getme a second term.
"Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism, there's no history."
Nixon was born to do this.
Give history a nudge.
- Come on.
I
"- Hear, hear."
"I mean, if Cambodia doesn'twork we'll bomb Hanoi ifwe have to."
That's right.
"And if necessary, I'll drop the big one."
We have to entertain the possibility.
Goddamn it.
I Who cooked this damn steak?
"Manolo, there's blood all over my plate."
Take it away.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Are you all right?
Yeah.
"My brother, Harold, was the same age as those kids, John."
- Tuberculosis got him.
"- Come on, itwasn'tyourfault."
The soldiers were kids too.
They just panicked.
-Quit!
Well?
want to indicate you to me where is the vesicle?
Ah... here.
"Either, or."
What cuts you would do?
From here up to here.
Thus?
And how I am going to be able to rummage about with the hand?
"What happens, idiot?"
You have something to say?
Want to operate you?
"No, no, Professor, was enjoying... with its words."
It is not hour to enjoy.
You do sexual activity that I want to begin to operate.
"Hurry up, to put to sleep"
If they do not extinguish the light there is no form to sleep to me.
It pardons?
Dr. Ciotti are you?
-Why?
It is not evident?
"-Yes, it is, only that I am afraid that I have been mistaken of operating room."
What means?
"In fact, I have come by the hemorroides."
Hemorroides?
Hemorroides.
"Cicchirini, between the vesicle and the hemorroides, there is much route."
We suspend during half an hour.
"Prepare, therefore I will do a new back tuna to him."
A tuna new ass?
"Why, the old man is broken?"
"They are misfortunes that happen, why to your sister."
I was one empanada away from a heart attack.
But then this...
"gorgeous godsend made me the lean, mean, fighting machine I am today."
[ Chuckles ] Hm.
[ Breathing rapidly ] Ho!
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
But I digress.
"Now, the good news is, we are hiring."
"The bad news is, there's only one trainer position available."
How do you feel about working in another department?
Huh?
Nice shorts.
Nice hairnet.
"Yeah, why do I got to be the lunch lady?"
Since when have you ever complained about being around food?
"Okay, this is not food."
"[ Peruvian accent ] Hey, new guy."
"Quit flirting' with the trainer and keep scooping', huh?"
It's all right.
"My, uh..."
Ashtanga yoga class starts in five minutes.
How the hell do you know anything about yoga?
You're not the only one who's ever dated someone bendy.
"Hey, you have any oatmeal?"
"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I wish."
"No, but we have, uh, something that's tofu over there."
I -- what is that?
It's a pancake.
It's tofu.
"I feel like a baby asking this, but..."
Will the treatment hurt?
Josephine wants to sniff out something authentic.
"Yes, exactly."
And you?
I'm just a guest here.
He lives in 503.
Max needs a place to crash.
"That's why you're here, right?"
"Although, who is Max?"
We'll see.
What is this here?
"Please leave him alone now, Franz."
I ask myself that as well.
I am leaving him alone.
You'll find yourself alone here...
Max.
Then have a good day.
"When you have a bit of time, I would like to show you something."
Not today.
Then I guess not.
Perhaps tomorrow.
May I ask you a few questions?
Very good.
What are you actually doing here?
You're very talkative.
Everything begins when we start to think for ourselves.
That's the basis for every change.
"The problem is, we have no idea about the products and goods, we continually use."
- No one knows where they're produced...
- No one actually knows what 's in them.
We are totally bombarded by foreign images.
That's why I propose this very simple action.
We all head out...
No!
- I Arthur?
"- Evil Clone, we do not touch the ""Don't"" button."
That would send Uncle Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
And let me say that hike back is no picnic.
I'd rather be strained through a chain-link fence.
[Shudders]
"Clone, go next door and fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick."
Got it?
A tissue sample.
I Arthur.
"You'll never get away with this, you over-confident blob."
The Tick will be on to that flimsy fabrication in a second.
He hasn't got a chance against the always-wary eye of the ever-alert Tick.
[Snores]
[Door opens]
[Snores]
"[Tick mutters] Oh, hello..."
"[Tick] Oh, no..."
[Tick jabbers]
"Arthur, I just had the strangest dream."
"I was taking some math test I hadn't studied for, and then you tried to saw off my head."
"Weird, huh?"
I Arthur.
[Chuckles] Of course you are.
And I Tick.
[Chuckles]
"Whoa, oh... [crashing]"
"Oh, sorry, Arthur."
"Blast this uncommon cold, anyway."
"Well, only one thing to do now."
Wear this supercold down with many hours of daytime television.
Everyone let's line up
So we can make our way down please.
Girls on on side boys on the other
Girls on on side boys on the other
Right.
Well good luck up there.
How could I have forgotten?
We reserved our seats together.
Oh Lily and Rufus!
Oh We haven't seen you
- Since we broke matzo together.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.
We were talking on the way over here
About what a wonderful couple you two make.
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.
Dating at our age is not enough.
Marry before it's too late.
Well It's not exactly
Uh We're just enjoying the journey.
Well Apparently at one point
We had a destination
But that no longer seems to be the case.
Subtle.
Mm I was going for honest.
Dear friends colleagues
As we stand here today
We bear witness to a bright new beginning.
Just standing in front of him
I-I couldn't do it.
"""Immediately, bring him back!"
"We'll chat and lay food on the table"""
"We'll bring him home, we'll settle it, And throw a fiest in his honor"""
--I came home --Very good
--Did you get wet?
--None of us are infallible
"Pasha, they left."
They flagged down a car and left.
36-63-13
--Yes?
--Please call Lyudmila to the phone --Could you call even later at night?
--Do excuse me --Just a moment
--Hello --Gera?
--Yes
"--I was calling Lucy --She's asleep, dad"
Please call her
Let them stay overnight there.
Don't drag the child back and forth.
She's traumatized as it is.
"Good evening, comrade Vasin."
To what do we owe the honor?
"Lucy, you guys come back home in the morning..."
--Yeah?
"--Well, that is..."
--...if you can review your moral code?
--Really?
"Dear Comrade Vasin, we won't come until YOU review your moral code"
--our moral code is doing just fine.
--just fine?
!
Did you take my casette player with you by accident?
--Or did you simply steal it?
- Maybe.
Hello?
"Yeah, Kevin."
Hi.
Is he all right?
"Oh, thank God."
"- All right, yeah, come pick us up."
We're still at his place.
- Where is he?
"All right, bye."
"He's-a, he's in jail."
"Ah, in Oceanside."
He was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
"Dad left some serious problems with the company, beyond serious."
You think you might have to shut it down?
Maybe.
Probably.
I can't go into details.
I can't even tell Joe.
You know what they say at business school... almost all family businesses fail in successive generations.
I mean...
- if Ojai is already having problems...
"- Then we should kick it to the curb, according to our M.BA."
That's the smart play.
It's not that easy.
Losing Ojai'd devastate my family.
"Come on, you have no idea what families can survive."
"Besides, you are not responsible for everything, Sarah."
You always took on everybody else's problems.
You could come back to North Light today.
You are on the fast track.
"No, that place was eating up my life."
What a lovely name.
The dawn.
"(PLAYS ""FANTASIE-IMPROMPTU IN C MINOR"")"
(SIGHS)
- I'm not happy with it.
- Why?
Because a perfect impromptu should seem spontaneous and free.
No-one should be able to guess at the desperate calculation behind it.
I've been struggling with this for so long.
It's like being tangled in a net.
I feel...
I have terrible dreams at night.
"I think if I ever finish it, then it will have finished me."
You must suffer tortures to find the perfect word that will make it all seem effortless.
Me?
Suffer for art?
You must be joking.
I suffer quite enough for life.
I have no hope to be perfect.
I simply pump out pages for money.
"No, your books are admirable."
I've been reading them.
Have you?
GEORGE:
Ah.
Is this your family?
"No, that's my fiancee."
"Well, we are no longer engaged."
Her family didn't feel that I was a very good risk for a husband.
No-one expects me to live very long.
- Balls!
- I beg your pardon?
Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of mothballs.
When were they issued?
This morning?
What do you do for heat in this barrack?
No stove.
"The men here used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily."
How long is temporarily?
I trust not until July.
Here you see a meal the prisoners are getting.
"Schulz, what are we having today?"
Bean soup mit ham hocks.
Would you like to taste it?
"- Thank you, no."
-Where's the ham hock?
There should be a ham hock!
"When you find it, we'll send it to Geneva."
Are there any complaints?
Please speak up.
Don't be afraid to talk.
"That's what the Geneva convention is for to protect the rights of prisoners of war, whether they are Americans or Germans."
- What have you got to say?
-I like it here.
What about you?
"It's all right, considering."
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?
Why don't you answer?
- What did you do to this man?
-They didn't do nothing.
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.
Don't fret.
I just lick the alphabet.
"A, B, C..."
"Nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"No, but..."
I thought you were thinking about me.
"I thought about a letter, then you, and then a new letter."
Don't discuss such matters with him.
I didn't say I was going to lick you.
Just licking in general.
"Of course I was going to lick you, but your name wasn't mentioned."
- All right.
- Let's go home.
Well done.
"- Hi, Mads."
"- Peter, isn't it?"
- Good game?
- Fine.
"Frank, I looked into that matter."
"Judging by what you told me,   the woman sold you that picture with intent to defraud."
The law clearly states that any transaction is invalid   if the seller had fraudulent intentions.
She knew you thought the picture was mouth and not hand-painted.
"When you reveal the fraud, the sale is invalid."
- You can demand your money back.
- I'm going to the car.
Bye.
Anyway...
"If you want to, you can sue her."
- Just say the word.
I'm off.
"- Okay, Mads."
- See you.
- This was awkward.
"Like, ""Wait a minute, no way."
Seth Meyers?
"- That wasn't him."""
- Their mouths were making noises.
"- I'm like, ""Why are you telling me?"""
"- They totally made out, like, for real."
"This was an interesting biological experiment, to have them making out in the back of that Yugo for a whole night."
- I think that's fake.
"- Yeah, they committed."
- Something came over them.
- Did they get pregnant that night?
Their characters did.
The characters got pregnant.
"Their characters did, they did."
Sick.
Was it awk...?
Did they...?
"Like, when you guys would cut in between would, then, they sit on opposite sides?"
"- No, we were all talking."
- They were chilling.
- Or were they still making out?
- They were friends before this.
"So it was more comfortable than it would've been, I think."
I don't think they were friends in italics.
They weren't friends afterwards.
No.
Bet she was pointy.
"It was fun, though."
I remember laughing a lot this night.
And we went really late this night.
"I think we went till, like, 6 or 7."
Let's talk later
Why don't you use this car?
"I will, of course I will"
When?
All in good time
"Namaste, sir. (Greeting) How are you Ramprasad?"
To that usual everyday question I usually lie everyday
You lie?
About being fine
You aren't fine
How could I?
I want to become a singer
I took up the liftman's job here in hope that you'd notice me someday
I sing extremely well.
Would you like to hear...?
Not now.
Only in-between floors
"That was folk, but I can change it to rap"
Let's talk later
I told you.
Try to understand.
I'll try to put in a word
"Mr Om, why did you lodge a police complaint?"
He's a poor guy
Because you are a traitor who pirates my music
So what's wrong?
It's only business.
If I make a few cents pirating...
I can spare a bit for you too.
"Fast-forward your life, Mr Om"
Don't you ever step into this office.
"Peace Mr Om, peace"
"You killed leslie stoltz,"
And we can tie you to both.
You guys are pretty funny.
"I mean, you just crack me up."
You really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me...
Based on a lambskin condom?
I don't think anybody here
"Mentioned a lambskin condom, genius."
That's knowledge only the killer would have.
Ah.
"You know, mr."
Enright told me
That she'd be a willing participant.
He told me that he was sick of the bitch.
"He gave her to me, as a bonus,"
Because we had a good year.
"You know, if she would've just relaxed and just..."
"Stayed with the program,"
Everything would've been just fine.
So that's when leslie tried to stop you.
She came barging in.
"And everything kind of went, uh..."
Everything kind of went haywire.
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
So you roofied anna
Because she wouldn't cooperate.
"I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size."
That was tony.
Do you want her?
You can have her.
America's premiere covert intelligence agency.
"But now that the war is over,"
My mission parameters these days are...
"Agent carter, cover the phones."
...Different.
That all changed when an old friend
Asked me to become a double agent.
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.
"A couple of weeks later, my inventions..."
They start turning up on the black market.
"As of this moment, howard stark is a fugitive from justice."
You're the only one that can clear my name.
Edwin jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.
I found the man who stole howard's inventions.
He was part of a bigger conspiracy.
Leviathan is coming.
Who is leviathan?
He didn't have time to tell me.
All he left behind was a symbol.
I must determine what this means
Before the ssr catches up to me Or my friends.
"Clearly, you don't know the rules of the house."
Is this not apartment 3-f?
Who are you?
Jimmy.
"My girlfriend, molly..."
she lives here.
I swear.
"5'5"", blonde, works at bonwit teller?"
Next one over.
Don't...
Let's get married.
You're a liar.
What if I'm serious?
I'm not in the elite like you are.
Bull always wanted to be a detective.
And?
And now...
"I've finally become a detective, and my career is on track."
All I can think about now is work.
You sure?
I can't think straight anymore.
That was amazing.
I remember.
That cleaning lady...
Which case was it?
Here it is.
"""In 1998, a restaurant chef, Shigehiko Kashiwagi,"""
"""was struck by his employee, Yasuo Ikezawa, with a frying pan,"""
"""and had his proceeds stolen."""
"""Ikezawa fled the scene and remains missing."""
"""Kashiwagi's wife Kiriko is also a suspect and has disappeared as well."""
"""The two are wanted on robbery charges."""
Did the victim die?
"No, but his right side was paralyzed and he's confined to a wheelchair."
"Robbery, and aiding and abetting."
"If that's Kiriko Kashiwagi, Ikezawa must be with her."
"Wow, this is a huge breakthrough!"
I'm glad I remembered!
I was just going through expiring cases.
Expiring cases?
The statute of limitations expires...
He put you right in front of me.
It's true that Chief Jung tricked me.
Because he told me that this was all to protect you.
"Then, it's all over now."
Since we know... that we all tricked each other.
Then does that mean it's really over?
Nothing comes after that?
- Hello.
- Hello!
Min Ki!
Sit down for a second.
"Hey, we're sorry..."
about beating you up that time.
Your grandma must have been very shocked...
"Hey, we're good guys."
"The shadow told us not to look for you, so we never did."
- Why are you here?
- Min Ki.
"You're a good source of information in this neighborhood, right?"
- You're close with the police too.
- Who said that?
Earlier today...
Was someone stabbed with a knife?
Why... do you ask?
There is this crazy kid...
who is going around bragging about it.
"He said he really used his skills, or something like that..."
- At Chung Gye Plan?
- Yes?
A man was killed.
They said it looked like a spiteful relationship...
Because he was stabbed so many times.
I'm well--known round here for it.
I'm famous in the chest.
"Don't half turn the chicks on, right?"
The only snag is if the waistband on your jeans is too tight.
That's what jeans are all about.
"If your jeans aren't tight enough, you might as well be dead, right?"
Can you repeat all that?
I couldn't hear you for the sounds.
"I was just saying, like, you know, I dig all your gear."
-
- You got any blancmange?
-
"- Yeah, I got two of their LPs."
Life's full of excitement when you're engaged!
Where are you going with that?
"The magnificent metal digit is going on the pavement, p--pointing at the shop."
It's the opening salvo in me new advertising c--campaign.
"You spare no expense, do you?"
It's your old ice cream sign!
That's just for openers.
The hard sell comes later.
-
- It's all peeling and rusty.
-
"- Oh, yes."
How is your mother this morning?
-
- She's wandering.
-
"- Oh, is she?"
Perhaps we can get her to wander off completely!
-
It's...
It...
Okay.
If I rigged the lottery... lf...
If...
"If I'm so smart, why would I let this hammerhead win half the money?"
"Well, you didn't want to."
You didn't plan on it.
But you got fired.
"Well, because of her."
"Hey, there were cables on the floor."
Somebody could have gotten killed.
They were duct taped down.
Nobody was tripping on it.
Okay.
Okay.
I told you about her.
Can we focus here?
Your plan was already in motion.
"You'd put the gizmo in the microphone, but getting fired ruined everything."
They escorted you out of the studio.
They took your security pass and you couldn't get back in.
"You had a problem, Billy."
A real dilemma.
Is that right?
Yeah.
You knew the six numbers that were going to hit.
But then what?
You were locked out of the building.
You couldn't just turn the magnet off.
You knew the same numbers were going to keep coming up night after night.

Often get defamed.
But I'm a minister.
If get defamed my party will be finished.
Vishwas fired a shot.
If Shiv's questioned... then me and my son will be in trouble.
The election's around the corner.
The media cannot be trusted.
Why don't you understand this?
Let's take care of Shiv permanently.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
I want to be on the top touch the sky... and you're still busy burying people.
I want to be a hit in politics not be on someone's hit-list.
- Mr. Pradhan...
- Enough.
You won't move a muscle.
I'll take care of things now.
If anyone asks say that Shiv's still being investigated.
The dog will definitely die.
But someone else will kill him.
Get it.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
Someone else.
Boss.
The inspector's here...
To inquire about Bajrang.
Go on.
Go to the dispensary.
Otherwise even the rats at home will fall sick.
Welcome Inspector.
For the first time...
an inspector's surrounded by goons.
- Boss...
But what truth?
The naked truth.
You met your brother in secret 48 hours ago!
- This is false!
- Do not deny it.
It is wiser to confess.
Mr Judge will consider it.
Do you have proof of what you just said?
Absolutely.
"This medallion, Mr judge"
You recognize it?
You authorized Dollon to keep it with him in his cell.
Why didn't we find the young man's body while his sister bears the medallion today?
It's you who gave it to me!
Do not deny it!
You lie again only to save your brother.
"You know very well that if he is found and charged with these crimes, he'll get the scaffold."
It shows a little.
Doesn't it?
"I understand that it is a concern, but do not make it an obsession."
"Turn your head, Sonia."
"No one will see it, I assure you."
Your scars are invisible.
When I think about all that happened...
Forget it.
- Let's eat.
- Sir?
- What?
- What is it?
- A lady asked for you.
- Take that.
She's waiting in the park.
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'll discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"Mallefille, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
Will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- ALL:
Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.
"And I reply ""Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."""
God has been buried by science.
But alive!
God exists.
"But he is no longer loved, so he hides away to conceal his broken heart."
(SYMPATHETIC MURMURS)
Certainly it is difficult to find God in our age.
And artists are the only hope.
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most peopleNhave different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
can you manage a smile?

My condolences.
I think of your husband often.NHe was truly a man of vision.
I hope you don't think I've takenNadvantage of your misfortunes.
Of course not. I'm pleasedNthat you purchased the company.

On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

Can't you see she's busy?
I'll tell you about her childhood.
Margaret dropped from Connecticut.
She went to church every sunday.
This is when she was sixteen.
What are you doing?
"This is my hair, you could at least consult me about it."
"I think, Jane, the hairdresser..."

Hair stylist is right.
We don't need this accessory.
The image should be simple.
Your photographs that Adrian was just showing me indicate a fairly traditional upbringing.
And you slipped to a weird off with some obscure fantasy look.

It's tacky.
You're tacky.
What do you mean by wearing all this weird make up and strange clothes?
Nothing.
You don't admit to dressing strange?
You're strange.
What do you mean by that?
I'm not wearing rags.
You're wearing what they want from you...baby.
America!
What do you mean America?
"I'm American, she's American."
He's American.
Where're you from?
-Detroit.
-Las Vegas.
-I'm coming from Montana.
I have nerves like everyone else

"Yes, I believe it is customary."
I suppose we go on the deck and into the matter comfortably.
I'll get my wrap.
"There we are, my sweet."

"We'll ride bicycles and everything, won't we?"
I myself prefer a horse and the open range.
With the vine fanning my cheeks.
And the stars for me guide.
"What was that, Jason?"
- What was what?
- What you just said.
"I don't know, my dear."
I'm afraid I wasn't listening.

- Your father isn't responsible.
I went into the show because I liked it.
I thought it had good possibilities.
It's no great tragedy.
There'll be other shows.

Sir?
I'm wondering who you have handling tech on Roger's murder investigation.
That's above your paygrade.
This isn't about Roger anymore.
I spoke to his father; he thinks it's an inside job.
"If we lose that supplier,"
"Spiga's current crop yield takes a hit, we can kiss our second-quarter projections good-bye."
That's above your paygrade and mine.
I meant what I said in there.
Roger was my friend.
"An asshole, but... my friend."
I know you need the help.
You don't even have a crime scene location.
How do you know that?
You wouldn't still be here if you did.
♪
My men scoured that trash dump.
There's not a trace of Roger Caplan or his assailant.
How'd you determine the location?
GPS from his car.
"Well, you can look there all day,"
Um ...
"No, thank you."
Don't you like cookies?
"Yea, but ..."
I feel kinda bad now.
Don't be ridiculous.
Are those oatmeal ?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong ?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in these ?"
Why are you looking at us funnny ?
"No, no...no"
It's just that you girls are not what I expected.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you've any milk ?
I hate to interrupt or anything but... don't you think you girls should better reload ?
"Excuse me, but what is your deal ?"
I rather not discuss it.
Why not?
"That's my business, that's why why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'll send professionals.
They did !
Then why is that matter I don't want to discuss ?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
We got ammo!
Then let's get this show on the road!
I'm expecting company.
What kind of company ?
I'd rather not say.
You two enjoy your date.
Here's a dollar for your troubles.
Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
Excuse me...
Excuse me...
Pardon me...
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

Good night.

Wow.
Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girlfriend?

The End
"Charles, you have finally lost your senses"
This venture is impossible.
For some.
"Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it IS possible."
That kind of thinking could ruin you
I'm willing to take that chance.
Imagine a trading post in Rangoon!
"Bangkok, Jakarta!"
The nightmare again?
I won't be long
I'm falling
Down a dark hole.
Then I see strange creatures.
What kind of creatures?
"There's a dodo bird, a rabbit in a waist coat and a smiling cat"
I did not know cats could smile.
Neither did I.
And there is a blue caterpillar.
A blue caterpillar?
Do you think I've gone round the bend?
I'm afraid so.

Please.
"In consideration of a Tót family, I promise,I will look for it."
- Yes.
- But do not expect partiality of me.
Yes.
"Na, what, Mariska?"
What?
This is the aim!
This does not untie everything of course.
I hope so I may expect you to be honest.
"Who gets tired, will speak."
Yeah?
"- Of course, major lord."
- Good.
"What happened, Tót?"
"Nothing, major lord."
"Because looked at leftwards, behind my back."
Yes...that.
A butterfly was flying in.
Butterfly?
What kind of butterfly?
Well as such...on him is two yellow patch and one red patch.
And you meanwhile the make of box you deal with butterflies ?
I just looked over there only.
Did you just look over there only?
"But you gave a thought to it meanwhile, following it would be good, to take, to strike dead."
"Happened so, or did not happen so?"

- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.
They're all in here.
follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, CIaudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
hello!
welcome.
"well, he left the salon at that moment."
CIaudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
PECKY:
"Good, you've got it."
"All right, good."
PECKY:
"Now, low, low, lower, lower."
(Ali speaking in Arabic)
"Yes, he does."
Every inch a king.
Who are you?
(Exclaiming)
"With the ceremonies complete, the tomb was sealed."
Tutankhamun was finally left alone in the silent valley.
"Pharaoh Ay reigned for just four years, leaving no heir."
"When a new dynasty began,"
Tutankhamun's name was removed from the monuments he had built.
"With his records erased, his memory was allowed to wither away."
"Goodbye, old chap."
- All done?
- All done.
"So, was it worth it?"
"I think so, yes."
"Oh, yes."
And did you find him?
"A bit, yes."
A bit.
"During his lifetime,"
"Howard Carter received no official honour in Britain or Egypt in recognition of his unique achievements, and when he died in March, 1939, his funeral was poorly attended."
But Tutankhamun's tomb remains the most famous archaeological find of all time.
"Since I was the only black kid at my school,"
I thought people stared at me all the time because they were fascinated with me.
Check it out.
"No, like Teto"
Still an animal?
"No, a sex beast"
"Big Sis, you're too open"
It's because you passed out even without drinking
My role was supposed to be yours
"No, Bebi as Lin, and me as Bebi, I guess"
It's not like I got my tits sucked or had my anal fingered
All he did was hug me.
And only for a couple of seconds
Even so...
Good boy
What now?
It's just love... hug!
Still think you are treating me like a sexual beast
Hee hee
Umm...
"You're late, sex criminal."
I told you to come in 10 secs!
That's why you'll never have sex without paying for it
What's that bag?
It's my breakfast
"Mr. Animalistic Desire, you ditched your stakeout?"
"Sorry, I've been on since midnight and I got hungry..."
You're complaining?
Even after the crime you committed?
I'm sorry...
Your heart wasn't in it
Really?
"Well then, I guess it's time I send this pic to your company"
I'm so sorry...
I truly appologize.
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans
Tomorrow morning... we're going to gather in Wushe
and offer a blood sacrifice
Our ancestors' spirits...
We're here for the guns.
Sorry to disturb you
- Boss...
- Welcome.
This way please
Fill them up with salt And give me ten boxes of matches
Wow!
"Lots of things to buy, huh?"
"Boss, we'll pay for it next time"
On credit again?
"- Yes, we can"
- How much is it?
"No, you can't!"
Wait!
You're buying all these on credit?
It's alright
It's alright?
But you never pay me back!
Let's give them a hand
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo really can't take it anymore?

Good morning!

What the hell was he up to?
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble
"But we'd be bored around here without him, won't we?"
You call making troubles interesting?
"I believed your promises, your promises and lies."
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
Terrible lie
You made me throw it all away.
My morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you :

Apple cider right right right.
"Well, good-bye, my puppet."
- Come on.
Keep moving.
- Fancy meeting you here.
"Why don't you come in, sit down, put your feet up?"
- Hand over those plans.
"- I've told you, I haven't got any plans."
- Talking won't get us anywhere.
- How are you?
- Let's search him.
- You've searched.
Don't you remember?
"I was down the road, my valet with me and some colored gentleman."
"Yes, we remember."
I suppose the girl didn't give you those plans just now?
That's right.
She didn't.
How did you guess?
- Oh!
We're wasting time.
"- If you insist, I'm only too glad to help."
- Never mind.
We'll take care of it.
"- No offense, old boy."
"Well, what did you intend to do with these cartridges?"
Cartridges?
"Yes, they are cartridges, aren't they?"
"I'm rather fond of shooting— Grouse shooting, to be precise."
- That's why I came down here.
- With a revolver?
"What do you expect me to bring, a fishing rod?"
I suppose you know that grouse shooting starts in August.
Are you crazy?
!
Nora!
Here.
Thanks.
"She doesn't understand me, so I got nervous  and let the tray fall down."
- It doesn't matter.
"I'm nice to her and I even gave her money, because she needs money."
- I had this well prepared.
"Tom, it doesn't fucking matter."
Nothing here is prepared.
Can you make breakfast for two?
Two?
Right away.
Leave it alone!
Just leave it alone for now.
"It's okay, we'll leave it alone."
We'll leave it alone.
Just a moment.
Pull yourself together.
"Hello, I'm Josephine Reiter."
Franz is starting up a commune.
This is no commune.
I met Josephine at an entrepreneur's seminar.
She was my marketing instructor.
"Great, and what does that have to do with me?"
Actually this is a historical location here.
But now my cousin wants to set up some sort of Christian-Communist enclave.
- Certainly there are people out there that would be interested.
"Maybe not here, but in general."
Am I right?
Certainly you can turn this in to something.
could you describe your relationship?
"well, we,re very close."
"THEY,RE CLOSE."
"We,re different, but complementary."
Describe CIaudine.
"She,s sweet."
"She,s strong-wiIIed, knows her own mind, meticulous."
- How do you show that?
- For exampIe -
Hands up.
"At first, Jean-MicheI expected me to serve him."
It was always me who brought up breakfast.
"He,d never think to bring me breakfast."
- You lived in a house?
- A house?
"You said ,brought up breakfast.,"
"It,s just an expression."
We live in an apartment.
- I see.
- Very good.
What about politics?
What role does it play in your life?
politics?
"We,re neither left- nor right-wing."
NEITHER LEFT
- NOR RIGHT-WING
"We,re not activists, but we keep up with the news."
"Jean-MicheI and CIaudine, you know why you,re here."
"We,re designing an experimental Urban Center, and we want its inhabitants to feel comfortable."
"You,ve been chosen as typical users of the year 2000."
"We want to Iearn about your desires, your fears."
We want to measure your basic level of social integration.

Naturally it hasn't been chilled
And your hiccup?
It's fine
"July 5, 1939..."
I danced with him
Feeling his warm breath on my skin drove me crazy
"I think he loves me, but we mustn't."
We must be strong
"I rather pity cousin Julien, poor fellow"
"If he knew a great love, it would transform him"
"My goodness, it's all so difficult"
A soul
Don't expect a letter.
We're not pen pals
Don't look at me like that
"I'll be' back, I don't intend going off to war"
"Write to me, your Aunt Agnes"
"Now, you be good"
Goodbye
I'll come to the station
Answer Julien
He can do what he likes - I can't stop him
Thank you
Why're you mad at me?
I'm your pal
"Maybe you think we're friends, but we're not"
Out of her head
What's this thing?
I wondered where I put it.
Although...
"I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now...
Why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferassin root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock, now, would we?"
"No, father."
"Seriously,"
Have you seen anything like this before?
"No, I have not."
She is unlike any wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer,"
Why would he protect her?
"Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too."
"They live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other wraith,"
He would be her first victim.
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
We just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's going to take him up to the cave.
I'm going to check in with the villagers.
What are you going to tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
You stole millions but I see you in a toddy shop.
Foreign liquor is boring.
Local toddy is too good.
You ruined all the money.
Moreover they were dollars not rupees.
What if I lose?
"Boss, you must live long."
You're the king who gave us party on losing.
When will you lose again?
Winners have the say.
We are losers and they are winners.
Winner boss...
When will you win?
"When you win, we will party."
You are right.
You're trying to cover up your defeat very well.
Cover up?
I don't know that.
Only now I knew there is lot of kick in losing.
Yes boss.
Every time I win and I've lost the kick in winning.
I lost for the first time in my life.
Now I know the kick in losing.
I'll pay the bill.
"When we lose, we should never worry."
You must celebrate it.
"When a man understand this, no loser will cry on losing."
Will party all the time.
Drinks all the time.
That includes you too.
Superb!
I mean your philosophy.
But in the area of death the ice is ruthless.
"Looks like someone had your bright idea, Bishop."
An accident rarely comes alone.
Sauber!
"It seems that your drug addicts friends are condemned here,"
What?
"Are we going to play now ""Cowboys and the damn Indians""?"
Only we are the damned Indians.
"Everyone knows the damn Indians never win, my friend!"
Noids have no combat training.
We do.
Re-assemble and prepare.
Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration.
I'll contact the base.
I say:
We hide in the next camp.
The next camp is 100 miles from here.
We're dead before we get there.
Do not look so serious.
I will not let you die.
"Very well, little one?"
"Fuck you, Hatta!"
Accept the shit.
We contacted the enemy right outside the Death Zone.
The truck is gone.
Subutai has fallen.
"But we ended up mutated humanoids in the process,"
So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393?
"Negative, but it has been hormonally changed."
We took a sample for an exam.
I do not care about mutated notions.
I want Ash-393!
Will he kneel down when he asks her?
They always kneel down.
"What is wrong, dearest?"
Willoughby?
What is the matter?
Forgive me...
I am sent...
Lady Allen exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin.
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?
What a disappointment.
"Your business won't detain you for long, I hope?"
You are kind.
But I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire.
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?
My engagements are of such a nature...
I dare not flatter my...
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.
"Willoughby, come back!"
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea for Marianne.
"- What is wrong, my love?"
- Do not ask me questions.
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves of his regard for Marianne.
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- Sure.
And smiles.
Many people need it.
It's the British specialty.
And we must remember the Belgian spectators
That the current conflicts between Flanders and Wallonia
Are counterproductive.
- Unbearable.
The image of our king is the only force that unites us.
That's why it must be perfect.
"- I understand, Your Majesty."
Excuse me.
- You are welcome.
Belgium.
Is it a real country or just a geopolitical compromise?
I do not know.
But he has a palace and a king.
"And a queen, who hired me to shoot a documentary about her husband,"
"Nicolas III, the King of the Belgians."
"Mr. Lloyd, I remember the rule number one: no interviews."
And rule number two:
No improvisations.
Sooner or later I would like to discuss this.
His contract speaks clearly.
Just follow the script.
"They did not know I was filming, which gave me hope."
Here's the boring part.
I follow their script and film the king who makes the king.
Have you been here already?
This is the first time.
But the scene serves to appreciate this unlikely story.
His own story.
--It's leaving --Hold it back
Hold it there at any price.
It's not over.
The night is young.
I am from the local newspaper
--From where?
--the newspaper
We're preparing a feature about how living arrangements affect family relationships
--I think you could help us out with this question --I'm on my break
Till 2pm Hello?
--5 minutes --Be so kind as to wait outside
--Darvatov?
"--Speaking, Pavel Ivanovich"
"Listen, don't halt the demolition."
Understood?
Do not halt it!
"I cannot, Pavel Ivanovich."
Let Sorokin call me himself.
--Your Sorokin will call you --When?
--I said he'll call you
"--Raya, did Sorokin show up?"
"--No, Pavel Ivanovich"
--Have a nice stay --The law lets you work here 2 more weeks
Nope.
Find yourself some other fool.

So.
Cho was killed here.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.

Shit!
Oh god...

What kind of twisted freak is he?

"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-go turns up dead two days ago."
$0?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."

What the hell?

Do not!
My truck!
Damn Noids.
Curse!
Look at this shit.
Ash scraped the engine and the whole system.
For the repair we need a GMM.
- A GMM?
"""A great damn hammer, you idiot!"""
The equipment and the ammunition are ashes!
We are 100 miles from the base.
A long way home without snow shoes.
Without Ash we're not going anywhere.
"The first time I agree with you, Bishop."
At the edge of the death zone is a probe with emergency equipment.
"If we get there, we have a chance."
Let's go hunting again.
You do not have to worry about hounding Ash.
... he will hunt us!
"The Humanoids were created, ready to serve."
They are stronger than we are and manage the weather.

His tranquility rests in Absence of reproduction.
But something is different now.
The rebellion is spreading.

Cruise director's going to greet the guests at the casino.
- Good to know.
- I'll send pics.
Good luck.
Thank you.
"- Bos, you getting this?"
- Prime time HD.
Check out his boutonniere.
Can you rate my rewards card?
- You guys get that handoff?
- Pretty smooth.
Running his face through the system now.
Check out contestant number two.
- We've I.D.'D Roman's bidders.
- Is there a pattern?
"Well, the thinner guy's Ivan Dunski."
He's got ties to the Russian mafia.
"And the barracuda is Erica Leone, attorney for the east coast's biggest racketeers."
"The other guy, Juan molina, is the leading Cuban drug trafficker."
Roman's dealing out his keycards to some faces.
- Faces?
- Legitimate names who front for big shots in organized crime.
"From Kate's passenger manifest search, she's identified four possible bidders."
- Three of them have already been to the casino.
- Who's the last bidder?
Ricardo Stancati.
Accountant with Detroit mob ties.
Keeps an ultra-low profile.
I will die for this.
The queen will kill me herself.
What a show.
She's going out in style.
must I do everything?
"Shall I catch my head in my own hands, too?"
When can we talk about my tomb?
A florentine sculptor?
20 tons of marble?
I can't afford it.
"After the 100 musicians,"
The dozen ships made of silver and gold...
Symbolic of my journey
To heaven.
I'm not asking for a fleet.
You're not headed for heaven either.
You're dragging this out.
You have to wait for final word
On bash's legitimization anyway.
Why kill me if the line of succession reverts to my sons?
You're a treasonous adulterer.
Then I'll continue with the seating chart.
"Mary, the feast will be held there."
Choose your place of honor.
You are going to die.
What they write about your execution won't matter.
It will to my children.
50 musicians.
I'll reduce the gold inlay on my tomb.
What is that?
There's a royal visitor.
French court has gone to hell.
- How is that saintly?
- ...she-asah il kol tzorki.
"My love, Jacob."
"If you ever loved me, stop."
- Stop.
- ...
She-asah il kol tzorki.
Stop.
Jacob?
Jacob?
Jacob?
"Jacob, you've had a complex partial seizure, which can cause psychosis, including religious psychosis."
Which means that this never was Jerusalem syndrome.
And I'm sure you're aware that were having these episodes.
Yes.
"What do you mean, you knew?"
How long has it been going on?
Since a few months before we went to the holy land.
That's when God first made himself known to me.
- No.
"- Oh, my God."
It isn't God.
It's epileptiform activity.
"Your brain has had spontaneous neural activity, and that's... that's what feels like God."
"We can't convince you of this right now, but what's more important is that we get you on the anti-seizure medication."
- And once the seizures stop...
- God will go away?
I don't want God to go away.
Repeat seizures can cause brain damage.
Listen to me.
"Yes, you are."
We need to section him.
And he was a cripple.
Goebbels:
Look at Himmler.
Hitler:
"You're not exactly Clark Gable yourself, my little doctor."
Himmler looks like a weasel.
Goebbels:
Making our enemies look bad was often easier than making us--
Hitler:
The perfect Aryan Superman.
A weak stomach in the presence of violence.
Woo!
Heinrich Himmler.
Didn't anyone notice?
"He was ruthless, but not careless."
And Hitler-loyal.
Who better to run the SS?
Art must be plausible.
"If you wrote a script about Aryan superiority and cast Himmler, people would laugh, walk out of the theatre."
"On the political stage, you can do anything."
Let's put up another reel.
Images to blur facts.
Hitler:
"In World War I, I was a messenger."
I never killed anyone.
I am a vegetarian.
I never eat dead animals.
I loathe big game hunters-- a gruesome bloodbath.
I would not allow smoking in my presence.
We discouraged tobacco consumption.
I insisted on the humane treatment of pets and farm animals.
I even issued a decree regulating the cooking of lobsters to minimize their suffering.
What lessons?
Violin lessons.
Is your violin tuned up well?
"Yes, but I first have to admit something to you, professor."
Tell me.
"What is it, Uluc?"
I am really bored with this violin.
Shall we just move on to another instrument?
Another instrument?
"Yes, professor."
I don't know.
Something more popular.
"For example, we have some entertainment nights in Urfa."
Entertainment nights?
Haven't you ever heard of it?
"For example, the Mici of Kahta... or may God rest his soul, the Boiler Bedih..."
"Yes, what do we do now?"
- What do you mean by what do we do?
"- Meaning, what's our new plan?"
"It's the fatal exam robbery, Chapter 2."
Are you doing this on purpose?
Speak in Turkish.
- That means we'll rob a bank.
- What bank?
The question bank.
The test exams for intensive courses.
Come on.
Why are we stealing them?
It's just a test exam as we call it.
"Because every week, their results are being mailed home."
"When our marks are low, our parents at home start nagging."
I can't take that anymore.
Listen to us first.
"We took you away from the Germans, didn't we?"
"I do not ask, I understand..."
We'll untie you today... and tomorrowyou'll order us to be executed...
"No, no, captain..."
They are young and stupid...
We want to help.
We've heard that our...
yourtroops are planning an offensive...
There is a minefield overthere.
We've laid all these mines.
We know all the passages and can showthem.
And what?
Do you think you'll score any points forthat?
"You maywant to receive awards forthat, eh?"
Who is going to believe you afteryou voluntarily defected?
"It is not so simple, captain."
"Grisha received a heavywound and was captured unconscious, and Valera followed him to the camp and was wounded later."
It is a heart-breaking story.
This is exactly what is called a voluntary defection.
and high treason.
"What should we do, then?"
- May be...
Yes!
-What's up?
Are you nuts?
"Come to your senses, folks?"
"Excuse us for doing anything wrong, comrade captain."
and for being harsh with you.
Sit down!
It is them!
- Hands up!
"In fact, they are the same path."
Hmm.
Good.
Good.
"But, there is so much more to understand, Adolf."
- So many died--
- Stop!
Conscience is the Jewish invention.
"For us National Socialists, action follows thought as quickly as... thunder follows lightning."
Hitler:
Let's finish this section.
"Typist: ""Enigma, carefully manipulated enhances one's power and fame."""
Hitler:
"Make that, ""Fame, power and immortality."""
"Obfuscation keeps people guessing-- the little feints, the ambiguities, contradictions... ln my first four years, as head of the Nazi party, I forbade photos to be taken of me."
"To my surprise, the efforts to keep these things hidden created a cloak of enigma."
People want to know.
They talk.
They were kept on edge.
"Yeah, better delete that last section."
Typist:
"You mean, starting with the line"
"- ""obfuscations""?"
"- No, no."
"From ""There were things about me that I was not comfortable with."""
"The horrors of the First World War, the turmoil of the post-war years."
"By the 1930s,"
Germany was an abused child.
"From her wounds, grew..."
"National Socialism,"
"""the great healer."""
"""The great healer."""
"No cell members, no lab, no dispersal devices."
We're still looking for escape tunnels.
Call us.
We're running out of time.
The attack's supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.
So getting Jind Allah to talk is our only chance of finding them.
- Time I confronted him with the truth.
- What are you going to do?
Show him my hand.
I'm going to give you the respect of telling you what just happened.
A team of agents raided an omega cell location.
"Actually, both of them."
Our men are in place in Annandale as we speak.
You gain nothing by remaining silent.
Jihad is forever.
Something's wrong.
His hands.
"Gideon, something's wrong."
This guy seemed relieved by what you just told him.
Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
- Get everybody out of there.
- Now!
Now!
Now!
- Everybody out.
It's a trap.
Now!
I said out!
Go!
How did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax without a single lab reporting a security breach?
Would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?
When i prove that i can do it
That's when i'll get my big reward
Keep that big wheel turning

"During the war, I fought side-by-side"
With captain america.
We defeated the enemy...
"Please, don't do this."
We have time.
...But I lost the love of my life.
"I work for the ssr,"
A map of what?
"Of Lake Singali, sir."
"Yes, sir."
And the privilege of diving into it to our heart's content.
Diving for what?
"- For emeralds, sir."
"- A barge full, sir."
"According to the information I bought, it was sunk in the year 241."
I can hardly believe it.
"Ballantine, a man of your intelligence..."
"MacChesney, at your age..."
"They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir."
"Thank you, Cutter."
That will be sufficient.
As for you two...
"I ought to take away your stripes, not only for insubordination... but for idiocy."
"Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy."
"But fortunately for you, I need all three of you at Tantrapur."
"We're going out on a job, sir?"
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn!
"Left wheel, quick march!"
Left wheel!
Attention!
Eyes forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sergeants, dismount!"
Cold.
Stale.
I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.
"Creeps or no creeps, we've got to get in touch with the Colonel."
Go to the market with her.
Very well.
What's so funny?
You're always giggling!
But they're tomatoes!
I suggested we go to the air-conditioned and clean Foodland.
But Aunt had to insist...
"It's not good to buy vegetables from such a dirty place, aunt."
"We have you with us for safety, don't we?"
Would you like some ladyfinger?
"Go and get some bunches of fenugreek from there, aunt."
Why must you need something so bitter?
"Papa loves it, aunt."
Give it to him everyday... and he'll will all his property to you.
If only fenugreek could get his property...
"Two kilos each of potatoes, tomatoes and ladyfinger."
Has Uncle spoken to you?
About what?
"About us, that is..."
Could we have some gourd?
What insolence is this?
!
Was that insolence?
What d'you think you're doing?
"No English, feller!"
You need a slap to rid you of your shamelessness!
Don't mess with him.
Let's move.
He held my hand!
And you talk of going away!
"Talk to me, lady!"
Never mind this chap.
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any hocus-pocus."
Or what?
"It looks like this, but we aren't stopping there!"
Depleted uranium.
What happens then?
Look here.
I had to do something simpler than dropping a bomb on them.
Like for example put it in grease.
A kind of cream.
But with a very different effect and result.
Here.
For example:
Number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
Exposed to radioactive radiation for several minutes.
With a remarkable result.
Imagine this...
"A larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
Do you understand?
We are what's left!
We are the nation's backbone.
Or to put it like our beloved Führer does:
"""We have so much to answer for, so we MUST win the war!"""
Sunshine?
"Yes, Operation Sunshine."
The protection of power and and dam instalations in Southern Norway.
"Stop the Germans from destroying too much, before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation.
"Poulsson is second in command,   and Skinnarland on radio duties."
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
Another one ofmy favorite leading men was Howard Keel.
"Best known for his rich baritone voice, he had a very competitive romance with Betty Hutton in Annie Get Your Gun."

Is this a store room or a mortuary?
"Sir, Principal and ISO officers are coming here to inspect"
I was asked to tell you to keep the students here even if the bell goes
- Even after the bell rings?
"- Yes, sir"
Who is this?
For 3 days no time to even breathe 1 minute
Time to ring the bell
Let me ring the bell
What happened?
You fainted on that day after you drank juice?
- When?
- On Sports day
"Yes, why?"
Who gave you that juice?
My name?
Then this book should also have more copies
NSS students gave me
Who told them to distribute the juice?
I don't remember now
"- Forgot, Shiva"
- Think...think
Then?
KS sir had arranged it on the table
What are you doing here when Inspection is going on?
In the absence of a teacher don't you know it is wrong to access the computer?
"I know, sir"
"Why are you not in class, sir?"
You've changed your shirt too
I have heard dogs can see in black  white only
Is this dog an exception?
"Sister, come"
If you make noise I will break your head
Stop
Who are they?
They are guests to our area Why do you chase them?
I can understand
That poor girl wore a red color dress
You should not have chased a one legged girl
One legged?
Were you not running?
Running?
"No, I am one legged?"
How can I run?
Let me think about it
"Oh no, it seems you have come running"
Holding my sister I was leaping
You might not have noticed the leg because of the skirt
"You are right, you may go"
She is one legged
You are deceiving him as one legged....
The truth will come out one day
He is going to make you one legged
-Be careful
-Let us see
Can't find a place in Ukkadam to start the party office?
Half of the city has already been acquired by us
Stop
Whose building is that?
Belongs to Dr. Nallamuthu
How is his background?
We take it very seriously.
"Look, in our e-mail,"
My husband and I said a lot of things.
Really it's just a bunch of words.
"What words were you referring to... ""drunk"" or ""nazi""?"
"Name-calling aside, once these matters come to light,"
We are mandated to address them promptly and swiftly.
"Well, what's prompter than forgetting about it?"
"You know, I've already moved on."
This type of behavior will not be tolerated.
You have to be stopped.
I'm sorry.
You're looking at me.
She's sitting over there.
"We're looking at you, dear."
We are all looking at you.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
This is starting to sound like it's about me.
Let's take a look at your file.
I have a file?
!
Mike!
"Uh, in her defense, she was very drunk."
"Besides harassing a teacher,"
"You've also been ""overreactive""..."
"""mildly threatening""..."
"""demanding special attention""..."
"Your ""intimidating behavior"
"Creates a hostile learning environment..."""
I am not the one who's hostile!
She's the one who's hostile!
Latest printout of the class attendance
Something's wrong with the computer!
Who got the printout?
You or I...?

Never mind and pay up the internet cafe. 150 bucks
You took pocket money five days ago.
Pay your obeisances
Hold on... here's a fifty

What do I do with this buck?
"Son, that coin... was the first token your father placed at our shrine"
You're always running out of money.
Keep the coin.

Good-luck coin...?
Yes

"- How do you do, more like."
"- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!"
- The pleasure is all mine.
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.
- Would you...?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.
I felt an interest which nothing can account for but my present delight.
"Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby."
Who is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?
- Marianne is reading them out.

Mine is 116.

It's the temporary bamboo bridge that the savages used in the past
"It's ugly and insecure, but they keep walking over it"
I'll tear it down sooner or later
But it saves them lots of time if they walk over it to fetch water or to the field
Look!
This wire bridge is strong and firm

This young man is Tado Mouna the eldest son of the Mehebu chief Mouna Rudo
But he saw us without saying anything

It's not a very good habit
"Oh well, they're savages after all"
Can you stop talking about them like that?
- Sugiura!

This is Officer Sugiura
This way please

"Carter, how do you check for spinal cord injury on an unconscious patient?"
- Look for absence of tendon reflexes.
- Do it.
Poor little thing.
"- Harper, what film do we want first?"
- Chest?
I'll do a cross-table lateral to rule out a C-spine fracture.
Deep tendon reflexes are present bilaterally.
Babinski is normal.
"Harper, let's talk head trauma."
What study should we do?
"- Come on, Harper."
Pay attention.
"- Pressure's falling, 50/30."
What do you hear?
Diminished breath sounds on the right?
I appreciate air movement bilaterally.
No pneumo.
"- No, that's upper airway sounds."
- I see a tracheal shift to the left.
- So do I.
- Tension pneumo.
Good call.
I'll teach you how to do a needle decompression.

Gossip girl has ruined our graduation
And it's only 2:00.
We have to stop her.
I don't know.
Messing with gossip girl?
Think of the consequences.
You can't ask us to jeopardize our futures for your personal vendetta.
Besides she didn't even say anything about us
Not even penelope.
Oh soup dumplings.
This is not my personal vendetta.
She attacked all of us and was wrong.
Completely.
Totally.
Well I'm gonna go do some damage control just in case
So don't wait for me.
Well what about you two?
Well of everyone here
You guys probably have the most secrets you're hiding.
I'll gather intel.
I'll run some stats.
I'm sorry...
About before.
About what part exactly?
the pre-graduation squabble
Or the fact that you no longer want to marry me?
What exactly is our problem anyway?
You tried to give me money behind my back
When i said no.
We both make mistakes.
But if we can't accept that about each other
How do we move forward?
Love you!
And you!

I don't know the answer to that yet.
"I mean, how old were you when you figured that out?"
I'll let you know when I get there.
Figuring out who you are is a constantly evolving process.
"""Constantly evolving process. """
That's three words.
I need more.
"How about ""sarcastic,"" ""moody,"" and ""cynical""?"
I didn't ask you.
And I'm not a cynic.
"I am totally ""glass is half full. """
"I just acknowledge that the other half of the glass is a desolate void of disappointment, misery, and regret."
Preparing ahead makes me pragmatic.
"Uh, speaking of being prepared..."
Homework?
Done.
I know.
You should call Ripley's.
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.
"What do you guys think, plaid?"
Definitely.
"But if I get elected president, I will bring it back."
Bigger and better and stronger than ever before.
# Cowardice
- Are you serious?
# Apologies for freedom
- I can't handle this!
# When freedom rings
- Answer the call!
# On your feet
- Stand up tall!
# Freedom's on our shoulders
- USA!
# Enemies of freedom
# Face the music
"# Come on, boys Take 'em down!"
# President Donald Trump knows how To make America great
# Deal from strength Or get crushed every time
"It's really great to be here in Cleveland, 2016."
A lot of beautiful people here.
1776!
# Over here
- USA!
# Over there
-USA!
"# O, say, can you see It's not so easy"
# But we have to stand up tall And answer freedom's call
I have never been more excited about a presidential campaign.
I have never seen a grassroots uprising.
This is not the Republicans versus the Democrats.
That's right.
This is the elites of the Republican and Democratic Party who have driven this country into the ditch versus Donald J. Trump and the rest of America.
I thank you for your support.
I wanted to hurt him.
I have my own life now.
And I don't trust him.
This is really not about me.
I never was.
It's all about him!
What now?
Will you report me?
No.
Don't worry.
Gentlemen.
- Is the collector here?
Of course.
This way.
The deeply-felt beauty of an object and the sorrow of its transitoriness.
"Accepting the fleeting nature of existence, understanding that the transitoriness of Creation bestows it with value is the foundation of Japanese culture."
Many collectors hide their pieces behind glass.
I prefer to let them hang freely.
It makes them come to life.
Our society is in a transition.
Instead of advancing away from the primitive...
We are drawn back to our base natures.
Some more than others.
"Stefan Kreiner, the junkie."
"Ironically, some of the most valuable artworks are on the most worthless bodies."
What's in there?
Everything needed to care for the tattoos.
- Skin care?
Interesting.
We should get down to business now.
I believe you have something with you.
The pinnacle of tattoo art.
"- I'm sorry, but the line has fallen."
My speech.
I'll handle it Before we arrive in Brussels.
"No, Ludovic."
This speech will write it alone.
"We must first analyze the political, diplomatic and protocol aspects"
"With the head of the cabinet, which is now unreachable."
And with the various federal ministers.
I'm not sure which ones.
"Sire, now we have to watch every movement and gesture, every word."
"Be cautious, sire."
"Faster, faster."
"When the king made his oath, he promised"
To always protect the integrity of the kingdom.
And that King is me.
Unity is strength.
Unity is strength.
We have to put it.
"Carlos knew that I steal hidden pictures, but he let me do it."
Carlos liked me.
Some have a vision.
Others have a dream.
"What does intuition tell you, sire?"
- My intuition?
Perhaps this is the time to show who really is.
"His feelings, his humor, perhaps his faults."
Defects have already been largely occupied by the press.
Nicolas the Silent?
Silence is dignified.
Let them write what they want.
- Sire.
Sire.
You have left me crippled
"Jagadish, my son..."
"Mamma, where have Uncle Jai and Uncle Jagadish gone away?"
"They have gone out for a while, they're going to be back"
Don't lie to the child
"Om... my son, this house is rooted on rock-solid foundation"
Jai and Jagadish will be back.
Surely
Only if we have this house.
What does that mean?
"As of now, this house belongs to Shekhar Malhotra"
What...?
- I borrowed forJai's education
Then I couldn't repay.
Now he has claimed this house
Joys you have always shared
Will you keep your sorrows to yourself?
Why...?
Because he is Om and he wishes to become a god among men
"High time that you thought about yourself, my son"
When must we leave this house?
Tomorrow morning
"Rita, they're married."
Let them take their decisions in life
Like her decision about getting married
"Mamma, I'm happy I married Jai."
- Great!
I'm elated
Your mother will never change
Work with their research teams?
Give up my claim to my design?
Then don't.
Go away.
"Doctor, we are terribly sorry, but we aren't doing it out of spite."
We don't have it easy either.
Such research is so terribly demanding.
We are trained specialists.
I spent my youth on a simulator.
With my head downwards.
I didn't have a childhood at all.
Do you know what it means to toil through cold eternal space from planet to planet whole light years
with such a half-wit?
You should take a rest.
Do you also rest sometimes?
-Only in critical situations.
-And how?
Shall we show it to the doctor?
"Well, actually it's a secret."
But we can show it to you.
"Ten, nine, eight, seven..."
-Six.
"-...six, five, four, three, two,"
"One, now!"
"So how did you like it, doc..."
RESERVATION
In the last episode of our serial Mystical Outer Space we explained some groundless theories about the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and their alleged envoys on Earth.
Today...
-There he is!
-Fasten your seat belt and no smoking.
How many times do I have to remind you?
Doctor!
Doctor?
-Are you here?
Hallo!
- Play the band!
ABCDEFGHI...
Matter is little serious.
No!
Hit high pitch!
How long will you sing the same line?
Come to the point.
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
That's it!
"Boss, we've memory loss..."
Past has vanished...
life is at full blast...
Hit the lucky chance...
What's this in between lines from film 'Chandramukhi?
"I don't remember anyone, I've lost my memory..."
Not like Rajini but like Ghajini...
Brain is empty...
totally it's gone...
"I'm having a good time, don't keep your face dull..."
Ex-girl friends who have left me...
And those silly clashes...
I'm saying thanks to the mental peace I'm enjoying now...
"Good or bad, sweet or bitter, she's not seen  flash is not leaving me..."
Life without love is better...
Who will bear that nonsense all the life...
Poor Devadas fell for Paru...
Your lover is somebody else's wife...
This life is better...
It's better than intoxication...
Silence is much better...
Spend life with empty heart...
Always fresh is the base of life...
"This is not good, Mr. Mogi..."
Otoharada...
Remember Me?
You should know that your acts no sense.
Make yourself.
Why do you think I agreed to share with you?
You need to know?
!
I will kill you
You will see
This is a promise!
"The man cut inside to by the police this is Otoharada Kuro, 46 years."
- The suspect in the early morning of 20...
- Otoharada... killed a taxi driver to Using a knife...
Kill the man and save my father!
Kill him!
Kill this man!
Sayu...
"If you shoot, they will launch the assault."
"If that happens, I can do anything for you."
Farm somewhat valve tone!
I also want to save the life of a murderer.
Do not condemn you!
Otoharada.
Shut up!
Shut up!
There's change .
To disarm the hostage taker special forces would prepare an assault .
The person whose name is written dies in this book
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds to make that happen
A cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
"The suspect Otoharada, would still entrenched"
She'll go sailing proudly down the years in the epic of dunkirk.
"And our great grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war-- by snatching glory out of defeat and then swept on to victory, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious."
Man:
"I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh, shall I see God."
"And I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold..."
I've got a son the same age.
"Aelwyn, the roman soldiers..."
They're coming?
Up the plain.
Hundreds.
Then today will be a good day to die.
What about the astronomicons?
We must remove them to the sanctuary.
Gather our brothers.
Go.
[drumming]
My blood is on your hands.
Murderer.
Murderer.
Murderer!
Murderer!

I'm looking for my brother
You are mistaken
Your brother is not here
I'm here for my brother
He's in the antique shop in the Xinlung Town
"""Antique shop"""
Alright... then your brother must have a name
Naturally; he's called Yian Luyan
"Sir, something has come up in the shop please come again tomorrow"
I'm sorry...
"Oh, my dear sir"
How can you... mess around with sir's name?
Why not?
That's what he's called
"Sir, it seems you're a novice in the boxer world"
Close the door
Okay
"Come, follow me... this way"
You are...
"Master Yian, he claimed to be your brother"
"It's you, Little Bat"
How come you are here?
"Brother, it's good that you recognize me"
"Good, you're quite grown up"
I'll see how much you've learnt from teacher
"Wang, please attend the counter there's no business for you here"
Yes
Come
Not bad.
You're half as good as teacher and 70-80 percent of mine
You've overpraised me
How is teacher keeping?
Before dawn we want a similar one
I can understand your plight
But all the members have gone out of station
"Arul has come, let us ask him to make it"
"Greetings doctor, why at this hour?"
-Come here
-What mom?
Why all of you are worried?
You must immediately make a wedding chain
Mom you know everything...
I can't
Don't be adamant make the wedding chain
"-Mom, I can't, you know I won't do it"
"- Don't shout, they are here"
"- It's very urgent, Will you do it or not?"
- I can't
Will you not obey your mom?
-They have come out of trust in us
"-Leave my hands, I am going"
"Wedding is scheduled for tomorrow, do it"
-I can't
- Do it for your mother's sake
- I can't and that is final
"- If you can't, don't meet me hereafter"
- Mom
- Don't give me reasons
- Why do you ask me....?
"- You don't do it, right?"
- OK
- We will collect it in the early morning
- OK
- Thanks a lot

In Night and Ice
Sea drama
Genuinely based on true story
Act I
Lowering a boat in the harbor
The stewards are carrying suitcases onboard
A well-known other(?
) Millia?
dar comes with his young wife on board (Toward the front in a slouch hat)
"The young woman was rescued while her husband drowned, since he was only anxious of helping others"
The port sides are shut watertight
Service on the command bridge
"The first officer observes passing ships, among others the four funnel steamboat ""Augusta-Victoria"" on a Hamburg-American route"
"The chapel steward plays ""Home Sweet Home"" during departure"
A tour of the decks by the mentioned passengers
Passengers' onboard pastime
The ship at full speed on high seas during the ill-fated night
Congratulation ...
Sir.
Werner Heisenberg!
"Dont leave, wait for me please!"
Damn!
"370 wifes or mistresses, or anything else..."
They allways lead with that they dont lnow anything about physics.  but that it was interesting.
"""Culture and science, is Germanys great strenght"""
Then moving on to the weather and other unrelated stuff.
"For exmaple ""strategic withdraw"""
"We withdraw with success, and show ""victoriouse resistance""."
But i like you
I've allways liked you Wanted you to know that
You are not one of those that give up to easily
"Stay with me, I want to show you something."
Its not only you that have been busy!
Look at this.
Conventional grenades.
"Completely normal, without any ""hocus pocus"""
"Or what, It looks like this."
but we arent stopping there!
Extracted uranium.
What happens then?
look.
I had to do something easier than drop a bomb on them
Like for example put it in lube form.
A kind of cream
But it is very different.
"Effect and result, look."
For example number 47.
"Stopzsky, Shlomo Stopzsky."
"Exposion of radiation, for several minutes."
I want a complete record of this.
Mr. Spock.
What do we have on this general area?
"Virtually nothing, captain."
No records of any explorations.
There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.
"However, none has ever been recorded."
Anything on intelligent life forms?
"Nothing specific, captain."
Unscientific rumours only.
More like space legends.
"Security control, this is bridge."
Status report.
"Mr. Sulu, status, alien vessel."
"They must be aware we're after them, sir."
They've gone to warp 6 also.
Warp factor 7.
"Aye, aye, sir."
"Something the matter, Mr. Spock?"
"A sustained warp-7 speed will be dangerous, captain."
"Thank you, Mr. Spock."
I mean to catch them.
"We'll either catch them, or we'll blow up, captain."
They may be faster than we are.
They'll have to prove it.
"Yes, Mr. Spock?"
"You mean to destroy the alien ship, captain?"
Of course.
I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
Destruction may be unnecessary.
"Colony Cestus III has been obliterated, Mr. Spock."
"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim."
"It is his Majesty's order, in person"
"My Sultana, a seal is needed on here too"
And one more here to have the subvention
Thank you
I bored you
This is good Daye
Mahidevran is cheerful
She's getting the reward of her tranquility
"If she lent my ear before, bad things wouldn't happen"
If it is not a good time...
"No, I'm available, come"
We'll go on later Daye.
Take these away
Is something wrong?
I met Hatice Sultana today
She's all fine
I wanted to tell it to you
Thank you for your care
"Actually, the icons worries her"
You know there'd be many gossips
What icons?
What are you talking about?
Haven't you heard?
İbrahim Paşa brought 3 icons from Buda
They are human shaped
Also they are half naked
You'd think they are real
They are all set up in the yard
"Your Majesty, you called me"
Are you taking care of the hunting lodge?
I visited the hunting lodge today
I selected a Spanish speaking concubine with İbrahim Paşa's order
"-Come after 1 0 minutes, I'll get card from my in-law's place"
-OK
- Brother
- What?
- Get ration card from our house and his house
- Yes madam
-Your name?
- Kanmani
- It is there
Your husband's name?
Arul Kumaran
"Baladhandayuthapani, Sornammal, Thirukumaran, Velkumaran, Senthil"
-Before that Arul Kumaran will be there
- It is not there
"Check again I have checked, check for yourself"
Mom!
"Mom, am I not your son?"
Did you not give me birth?
Is that man my dad?
My name is not there in ration card
How come it is missing?
Who gave names?
Am I so unwanted?
Atleast girls can have husband's name in initials after marriage
"But males, have to use dad's name in initials, no other go"
He may say I am not his son
"But for me, till my death he is my dad"
Otherwise it will be a stigma on you
I don't want to defame you
"Go, all of you"
Have you heard him?
No one can give troubles to one's son more than this?
Stay there!
(GROANS)
CONSTABLE:
Monsignor.
We have your silver.
We caught this man red-handed.
He had the nerve to say you gave him this.
(SINGING) That is right
"But, my friend, you left so early"
Surely something slipped your mind
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?
"Messieurs, release him"
This man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
Now God's blessing go with you
"But remember this, my brother"
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man
By the witness of the martyrs
By the passion and the blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have saved your soul for
God
(SINGING) What have I done?
"Sweet Jesus, what have I done?"
Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run
Have I fallen so far And is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate?
The cries in the dark that nobody hears
Here where I stand at the turning of the years
Get in position!
Don't waste your rounds!
Wait for a clean shot!
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Now!

So what did she look like?
It hurt like shit sitting on the floor with my knees crossed...
I wouldn't have held out much longer anyway.
I just sat in a way that was more comfortable.
Get out!
Did I say something wrong?
"No, but I have things to do today."
"That's perfectly clear, I could understand that."
So what did she look like?
Although it could have been a wig.
Alright then.
So what should I do with him now?
The usual procedure.
I'm going to find a decent cup of coffee.
Max!
I have to get back...
"Dakis, have a drink"
Go home and get yourself dead-drunk
We can't drink anymore
- We already...
- Drink!
"The millet wine that we make can set our people free making them sing and dance, cry and laugh freely"
You'll see once you're drunk
Go home now
Mouna!
Father?
"Mouna, the tattoos on your face are still so dark and clear"
You're indeed a Seediq Bale
You're a true hero
Mouna?
Look at the lines on that rock
"It split into half when struck by the lightening, didn't it?"
In the dim light at dusk the lightening splits a rock into half
What a beautiful sight!
Father?
I can't keep the intruders away
"(Ah, it's for real)"
(Here I am)
(I used to guard these mountains and forests bravely)
"(Oh yes, it's for real)"
"Mouna, let's sing"
We haven't sung together for long
(Reminisce the people from the past)
(Here I am)
(I used to guard these mountains and forests bravely)
(These are our mountains)
(These are our creeks)
(We're the true Seediq Bale)
The fifth round is about to begin
Kong tests him with a left punch
A punch
Followed by two
Ah Mut Sha delivers two kicks
Two kicks
Get up
He's up
He's exhausted
Ah Mut Sha uses his left knee to hit him
A left kick
Beat him
Followed by a left hook
Ah Mut Sha is hit on the head
Ah Mut Sha hates people hitting his head
He hits Ah Mut Sha's sore point
Ah Mut Sha is dizzy
Don't let him hit again
He delivers more kicks with his right leg
"A left punch, this is powerful"
Then a left punch
This is lethal
Now let's see who has staying power
The one with more endurance will win
The fifth round is drawing to an end 30 seconds more
Let's see who the winner is
Both are exhausted
Let's see the final result
His left hook didn't hit the target
Ah Mut Sha kicked in the air
Kong Yuen Sang retreats to the side of the ring
Ah Mut Sha wants to dash over
I'll be back soon
How is it?
- Good
Don't move
Is it too big?
Where are you going to?
I'll drink some water
Emergency Clinic?
This is the police We are all around you
Drop rhe gun and raise your hands
There's just no way out of here
We are all around you
Drop your gun and raise your hands
Yes?
"Yes, come up"
How are you?
You could have told me about the lack of an elevator
What's happening?
"Come in, come in"
"Follow me, please"
Would you please raise the blind
This is a bullet wound
I dont know if you've noticed but his condition is critical
You have to do something
"Lady, If you what him to live he has to be taken to the hospital right now"
How much do you want?
Here you have one million
And another million once he's healed
Please
I'm going for the instrumental
I'm coming back right away
Although the content of the Pope's message is kept in secrecy

"As Führer, my mirror filled with my image... but the glow was brief."
"And when the brightness fades at twilight, the brutality has begun."

The only remedy is to lash out.
Ever so slightly the fog lifts.

"The decision will be mine, Doctor."
I have the responsibility for your safety.
"Mr.Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below."
"No detectable soil or vegetation, extremely hot, toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storms, continuous volcanic eruptions, deadly to any life-forms such as we know it without oxygen and life-support systems."

"817 01:07:16,100 --&amp;gt; 01:07:19,300 - Today I bought my bag."
- Congratulations.
"818 01:07:19,351 --&amp;gt; 01:07:22,903 Guess what Orkun bought me?!"
"819 01:07:25,600 --&amp;gt; 01:07:28,116 I wish there was a problem because you didn't buy the bag."
"820 01:07:28,116 --&amp;gt; 01:07:30,669 So.."
I have two of them.
"821 01:07:30,669 --&amp;gt; 01:07:34,397 Let's put one in the fair, for the women who are victims of violence 822 01:07:34,397 --&amp;gt; 01:07:36,600 No, this would be violence against a girl 823 01:07:36,676 --&amp;gt; 01:07:38,560 Her heart would ache."
"824 01:07:40,929 --&amp;gt; 01:07:45,346 - Come with me Eylül and help me."
- Okey.
"825 01:07:54,000 --&amp;gt; 01:07:56,700 I called you so many times."
"826 01:07:56,746 --&amp;gt; 01:08:00,466 I know..."
But I'm still not over.
"827 01:08:01,600 --&amp;gt; 01:08:03,433 What happened?"
What?
"828 01:08:03,433 --&amp;gt; 01:08:07,900 You should tell me."
After me you were with him the whole night.
"829 01:08:08,000 --&amp;gt; 01:08:10,800 The house was on fire because of you two."
"830 01:08:12,200 --&amp;gt; 01:08:18,100 Look.."
I don't know what you are talking about..I do not know what you're facing...You're being ridiculous.
"831 01:08:18,100 --&amp;gt; 01:08:22,500 By the way you can't do this to me..."
"Because, I..."
"832 01:08:29,500 --&amp;gt; 01:08:34,100 Really..."
"Today, I don't wanna talk about this..."
Okey?
Please.
"833 01:08:34,200 --&amp;gt; 01:08:38,600 Okey."
It's better.
"834 01:08:38,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:43,200 Everything is okey..."
And that guy is back to his place where he belongs.
"835 01:08:48,700 --&amp;gt; 01:08:50,900 Yaman is free."
"836 01:08:54,300 --&amp;gt; 01:08:56,600 He is by the Serez's."
"837 01:09:03,800 --&amp;gt; 01:09:07,900 It's obvious you become a mother very young, the same as me."
"Let me ask Mrs. Ender, let me see what will she say."
Don't let Mrs. Ender know about it please!
I can't give money to anyone without her knowledge.
How can I give it son?
"Brother, I really need it very much.Look, I will pay it back as soon as I can."
What do you need this money for?
"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."
"Yaman, here you are, 300, it's not advance payment, it's from my pocket."
But it's a debt.
"- OK, it's a debt, you will complete the rest somehow. here 50 from me, &amp;gt; Thanks, &amp;gt; and from me, &amp;gt;also from me &amp;amp;gt, me too- Thank you , Thank you all !"
This is from me.&amp;gt; thanks..
Do you have 50 TL now?
"Thanks to all of you, really, as soon as I have money in my hands I will pay it back, I promise"
How will you complete the rest?- I will see.
Thanks- May you use it for the best.
How much money would you give for this? &amp;gt; Let me see.
Mira calling.
One moment...
Hello!
Mira:
Hello!
Did you get out of the interviewing? &amp;gt; Yes.
How was it?
"Not bad- This means it was very good, right?"
I don't know.
Let me take the last exam and we will see...
What time is your exam at?-At 3 o'clock!
"I have to close it, I have to study a little more."
"OK, let me know as soon as you are out OK?"
I want you to give me the good news first.
"I will call you&amp;gt; Okay, success! &amp;gt; Thanks."
The interviewing was very good.
So plus 5.
"5h plus 5, and that is choice C."
"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."
Let me see.
I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.
The social worker does that.
Not the doctor.
"Not the psychologist, not the nurse."
We do.
That's is what makes us agents of change.
2013.6.11 Lotte Card Art Hall
SlSTAR back with 2nd  regular album after 1 year
Their comeback exclusively  shown by Melon
"Hey it's really  strange, strange"
I've never been like this  but whenever I see you
My heart starts running
When I see your face  I start wondering
I can't control my face  I'm going crazy
"I want to see  you, you again"
I wanna say woo  woo woo woo yeh
It's because of you  I don't want to say it first
But it lingers in my mouth
Loving U U What should I do  What should I do
I can't control it
My heart is broken heart  I can't bring my mind together
Boy I'm falling in  love with U U
"What should I do,  what should I do"
I can't let you go  I love you
Baby I'm in love with you ok let's talk about love
Men try to blow whistles at me  And get me
All of them goodbye now
"My cute voice will only Call you out, you~"
What should I do I think I'm in love
Woo woo woo woo yeh
It's because of you
I don't want to say it first  But it lingers in my mouth
Loving U U What should I do  What should I do
"Anyway, I don't want to focus too much on that."
You can play around with that if you like.
Minus this whole thing evaluated at 0.
So what's e to the minus 0?
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1."
Right?
That's e to the 0.
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes plus 1 times-- now, sine of 0 is 0."
"Minus 1 over s squared, cosine of 0."
Let's see.
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have minus 1 over s squared, minus 1 over s squared, times 1."
So that is equal to minus 1 over s squared.
"And I think I made a mistake, because I shouldn't be having a negative number here."
So let's backtrack.
Maybe this isn't a negative number?
"Let's see, infinity, right?"
This whole thing is 0.
"When when you put 0 here, this becomes a minus 1."
Yeah.
So either this is a plus or this is a plus.
"Let's see where I made my mistake. e to the minus st-- oh, I see where my mistake is."
Right up here.
"Where I factored out a minus e to the minus st, right?"
Fair enough.
"So that makes this 1 over s, sine of at."
"But if I factor out a minus e to the minus st, this becomes a plus, right?"
"It was a minus here, but I'm factoring out of a minus e to the minus st."
So that's a plus.
This is a plus.
"Boy, I'm glad that was not too difficult to find."
So then this becomes a plus.
And then this becomes a plus.
(chuckles)
"Fred:Oh, and I almost forgot to say,"
"I'm gonna give Judy a basket, too."
"Um, I don't know why, exactly, but for some reason, my ""Fred"" channel on YouTube says that I joined two years ago."
"If I would've joined two years ago, I'd only be 4 years old."
Do you really think I'd know how to work a computer if I was 4?
"Seriously, I thought you were smarter than that."
"So, yeah, it wasn't actually my channel."
"I was just annoying YouTube, I kept banging on their, you know, door."
"And finally, they said, ""Okay!"
"We'll give you the channel."""
Time to go outside!
Here I go!
(laughs)
Fred:Let's run!
Happy May Day!
(gasps) (gasps in slow motion) (screams)
Fred:He threw the basket at my face!
(Fred crying)
"Fred:I spent so much time working on that basket, trying to make people happy, he threw the darn basket at me!"
"Oh my God, look at this."
"I just realised that right behind me in my neighbor's yard, there's a dog kennel."
"You know inhumane that is, locking your dogs in frickin' gates?"
"How would you feel if I locked you in between gates and watched you from above, laughing evilly?"
(Fred laughing evilly)
Fred:Dogs don't like it either.
"(Fred) Oh, my God, look at this kitty."
"She doesn't wanna be discovered be me, look at her run."
"Fred:Oh, it's a stray kitty with lice."
"Also, I bit one of the other kids in my neighborhood and gave him rabies."
"Oh, my God, she just bit me!"
She just bit me and I'm foamin' from the mouth!
I don't see the point when I can just use an actual joystick.
"And what's really weird is that this thing, again, is just a piece of plastic."
"It doesn't have any wires connecting to it, you just plant it there."
And the buttons actually work!
"And it steers okay, too."
"To tell you the truth, I'm stunned."
Ass!
"So, that covers most of the dreaded NES accessories."
"But, I know that there's one in particular that I didn't mention, but, you know, can't do it all in one shot."
"So, we'll save it 'till later,"
"I'll see you next time,"
I think you know what's next.
Western illinois Women's Soccer returned home to face Grand View last week Sunday.
"Head Coach Tony Glinn used much different starting line up then in previous matches, but it payed off early and just in the 11 min of play Senior forward Amy Unzicker recorded her first career goal to put Western up 1 nil."
Unzicker
Shot!
Amy Unzicker barried it.
Amy Unzicker her first goal as a Leatherneck.
Congradulations Amy.
Head coach said there is going to be a Highlight reel.
Sure enough we are going to get one today folks.
Grandview will tie things up just 10 minuets later.
In the second half it was all Western illinois.
Now Rite is in the box.
Cross comes in Julies Heads!
Yes!
Oh baby.
4 to 1 Western illinois.
Kellie Julius 's goal in the 67 minuet of play put Western up 4 to 1.
Thy weren't done yet.
Shot comes in Abby goal.
What a finish 6 to 1 Western.
"Really, you made me so happy by coming here."
I was so touched that day...
"I couldn't stop the car, you couldn't talk with Yaman..."
"Enough to know that he is fine, I will come from time to time to see him even if it's from distance."
It's okay even if I don't talk.
It's enough for me to know that he is happy.
What's up?
Fine! &amp;gt; It's been a while we have met.
Do we use to meet in the past?
What's happening to you?
Let me know if we are on outs.
"No... far from it, why should be on outs.. for being on outs... there has to be a communication... right?"
What? &amp;gt; All the best with your studies!
See you!
Rudeness...
"He has grown in the mud but ,my kid didn't become dirty."
Don't let him become dirty!
Keep it if you want.
Really?
- Take !. there are more in the photo album.
Do you love Yaman?
"Yes...I mean like a friend,i love him.."
I have a boyfriend.
We are together for a long time.
Do you love him then?
"In fact if you look, it's very stupid to think of something like sitting here... but Orkun was always in my life, from my childhood."
We grew up in the same aquarium.
"I don't know if it's really love, habit or we got used to each other..."
We get on well.
"I mean Orkun is very nice, cheerful, ..."
Funny.. -Yaman is funny too...
"Yes, Yaman Is very different of course..."

And always smile.
- I'm sorry.- It's okay.
"We can sit, if you want.I keep stepping on your foot."
Dance with Fatmagül.Go ahead.
"# I withheld my eyes,# Kept my words quiet."
"# Scattered my ashes,"
It's been so long since I last danced.Was never good at it.# While my flame is alive.
Just leave yourself to the flow of the music.
At least good things like this also happen in our life.
Enjoying this night despite everything... ... the best way of fighting our enemies.
- This is our second dance.- The first one was a reluctant one.
I was excited that day at least as much as today.
"They were beautiful that day, but...Your eyes are even more beautiful now."
"- Mustafa where are you?- I am outside, what's up?"
I'm told you didn't come to work all day.I got worried.
I had some matters to take care of.
"Good then, I was afraid of you and Kerim getting at each other again."
- Nothing happened just yet.- What does it mean now?
Nothing.
I mean don't worry.
- There's nothing I should be afraid of then.- Nope.
"- Alright, good then."
See you later.- Laters.
Damned bastard!
He is acting all bravebecause he knows we depend on him.
"My hands are tiedGod damn it, I can't punish him right now."
We need to remain calmuntil the trial.
How dare he do that to me!
No way Reşat...
I don't think this could be true.
- I expect anything from him... - But not from Meltem.
I don't believe that Meltemwould do such a thing.
We didn't know that so we both came here wearing hats.
We look too much alike.
This is the hat Dae Hyun was planning on wearing.
But he took it off and now he's getting his hair styled.
The concept has us meeting altogether in New York
"After wandering around in L.A., San Francisco"
And in Washington D.C.
There's a scene where Dae Hyun and I pass by each other.
Since you're wearing a hat it'll be better for you to sit down.
Dae Hyun can walk.
I'd only seen that in my dreams.
How cool is that.
That's the Statue of Liberty.
I can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance from here
It's so amazing.
It's the most exciting and cool thing I've seen in the U.S. thus far.
"It's huge even from here, how big would it be from up close?"
I was so surprised.
I wasn't expecting to see it from here.
I'm seeing it for the first time.
I'm seeing it from afar.
"Wow, I'm really in NY."
Cut!
The atmosphere in the background helps a lot.
It matches the song very well.
So it's very empowering.
"Today, the concept for my outfit and hair is an intern at the Brooklyn Newspaper."
It seems very different from the Brooklyn I'd seen in movies.
I really want to go to where the statue of liberty is at.
I think we might go. or I just have to go there.
"Please put an ice cream cone here, with CG."
"Finally, I got to see the Statue of Liberty."
"You wanna know if I was moving on without you I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"To tell the truth I've thinking about you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
Burning Desires Part Two
[Questioner:]
My whole life I thought I wanted to get married and have a child and live happily ever after.
[Mooji:]
"Yes, Yes Yes.."
[Q:]
Ok?
And it hasn't happened.
I've been in and out of relationships.
And I'm getting older.
"And I still believe I want to find this man, who is going to make me happy and I want to have a child with him."
And I want to live happily ever after.
"And then I find this man, and then I'm finding his faults."
And I don't know if I want him anymore.
I don't know if I want his child.
Because I'm looking for something else.
And I've been doing this most of my life.
[M:]
Yes.
"Some,something. ..It's good, It's good to say"
"It's good to say, because I don't think you're not the only one, Ok?"
[Laughs]
[M:]
Ok.
"So, like this, it's good to speak it out."
"Because then you send, it out again in to the empty, in to space."
"And what is clear, is that this is not actually bringing any happiness."
"It is a sort of like a promise, promise, a sort of something, and keeps you on the move, you see."
But you're aware of this now.
You're aware of that.
3 minus 1.
So it's 6 over 2.
"When x changes by 2-- that's this 2, change in x-- y changes by 6."
That's change in y.
So the slope is 3.
So the equation of our line is going to be y is equal to 3x plus some y-intercept.
And now we could substitute some points in.
Let's substitute this one.
"This 1, 1 seems easy."
So y is equal to 1 when x is equal to 1.
So we get 1 is equal to 3 plus b.
Subtract 3 from both sides of this equation and we get what?
"1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal to-- obviously, this disappears, 3 minus 3."
So b is equal to minus 2.
"So the equation of our line, we have a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of minus 2."
The equation is going to be y is equal to 3x plus b.
Well b is minus 2.
So minus 2.
And that is choice C. 32.
The equation of line I is 6x plus 5y equals 3.
And equation of line q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
Which of the statements about the two lines are true?
"OK, let's see."
They have the same y intercept.
They're parallel.
They have the same x-intercept.
Lines I and q are perpendicular.
Well I'll tell you how you can identify perpendicular lines.
They have the negative inverse of each other's slope.
But I don't know if that's going to come into play yet.
I always find it easier to look at these lines in kind of the slope y-intercept form.
So let's do that.
And then I was working for Larry McDonough janitor work at the school.
He was the treasurer in charge of the ... there.
Where was his - ?
Grand Rapids.
So I was picking up a little money there.
And when I got done with the school at 7 or 8 o'clock at night I was painting apartment buildings until midnight and then back up again the next morning to go at it again.
You couldn't get a job.
I was making $5.50 an hour at
Steel Case.
Nobody's going to hire you.
"Because two weeks from now, Steel Case calls you back."
So the only place I get a job was to go to Spartan
Warehouse.
They paid a little more and I also had the 7 years teamster.
So then I just put my ... in his apartment and retired and came here.
Built this shack and that was it.
This house is out of styrofoam by the way.
"At Spartan, that's they way they built - Everything was out of styrofoam."
"So, Steel Case, did they call you back, then?"
"Yeah, but I was already in Spartan."
And how long did you work for Spartan?
"Oh, 24 years."
I lost some time getting a hip replaced so I had to work a little bit longer
"So you were off, away from Beaver Island, for a total of?"
"35 years, maybe."
And what brought you back here?
"Oh, hell, I never left."
Never left.
All our vacations were up there.
The kids never got out of Michigan until after - I don't know when they got old enough.
I guess when they got married.
My daughter went to Alaska and my son went to
"And when I trained steps  to work with this program,"
I use Thay's story and some  of you may have heard this.
He talks about -would you hold the mike for me so I can demonstrate this?-
"He talks about the flower and -no, for me.- (Laughter)"
- (K. Weare)There.
"- (J. Bell) Okay, here we go."
"So, Thay - a little more to this side."
(Laughter)
"So, Thay talks about the flowers like tulips that close up at night."
"Every morning the sun comes up, beams down... (Laughter)"
It is not working.
"The flower is here, the sun is here."
(Laughter)
(K. Weare) What are you going to do now?
And the sun beams down its photons indiscriminately on the flower and its natures open up.
The story works  with young people.
"The young people came in  like this, all closed up."
"And our job as teachers, and parents, and Youth workers, is to beam down love and respect indiscriminately on what they've done."
And they begin to test it out.
Sometimes it goes like that.
(Laughter)
Sometimes it goes like that.
Sometimes it goes like that again.
But our job is their nature to open to their own health.
And they will move towards that.
"Sometimes it takes years, we know."
"We get letters from students,  10, 15 years out of Youth Build saying,"
"""Thank you, I couldn't get it then, but now I know."""
Thank you.
(Laughter)
"So,respect and caring, one is going beyond what they expect, for instance, they said it was, ""Oh yeah, they come and grab me."
They knocked on my door  when I didn't get up for school.
But there is somethingin which I'm sure...I've seen it before.
But where I saw it!?I can not remember. ok
Tell me ifsomething comes to your mind.
I'm going to talk to Kemaland see what you he has heard so far. thanks Yasin
Can I do anything elsefor you?
"Thank you very much, brother."
"I'm coming day and nightuntil you recover, everything you want from me,I am at your service , brother"
"Check my family,from time to timeand that's enough."
"Okay, do not worry."
"Mahir... well if you had not died,I'd be very upset."
"Sister, I should goto Ayten and Nurten we were very concernedfor my brother"
"Mother, let's go inside,I feel very sleepy."
Look dad was here...
"Dad, you're here,We are very scaredat night without you."
"I can not go in now,"
"I have a very sick friend,I need to see him..."
"I'll come back later,OK?"
"Uff .. adults still do what they want!That at least once, do what I say!"
Ilknur...
Tomorrow is my dad Nazifcourt date...
I'd comeif you do not mind.
good nighy bulent good night
"My brother is good,Ayten will be very happywhen it hears that and it will be better,It will raise its morale!"
"My sister is really not good,she cried the whole timeand does not leave the room."
"It is because of my brother ..wait, I'll goand talk to her .."
"Sister Ayten,"
Don t be sad my brother is goodand will survive...
"Sister Ayten, my brother is good very well, the doctor saidit will quickly get out of the hospital!"
"Sister Ayten, pleasedo not be sad..."
It's a miracle...
is there something elsewhy are you like that?
You d bettercome back later.
"Well, I..."
Save it for your performance.
"Well, phony's not quite the right word, but it's more like a show off."
A show off?
-Like you know all the answers.
-Yeah.
"And I want you to be more human, and that doesn't seem very human to me."
To know all the answers is not very human?
"Yeah, and right away find out how"
"I'm kicking my feet, and why am I doing like this."
Why are you doing like that?
"Oh dear, I've got eyes."
I can see you kicking your feet.
I don't need a scientific computer to see that you're kicking your feet.
What's big about that?
You don't need to be wise to see that you're kicking your feet.
"I know, but it seems like you're trying to find some reason for it."
I don't.
It's your imagination.
"Okay, I know what I'd like from you."
Can I tell you what I'd like from you?
Yeah.
"I'd like you to be aware that I'm kicking my feet, and to be aware that I'm giggling when I'm really nervous, and accept it instead of putting me on the defense of having to explain it."
I don't want to have to explain why I'm doing these things.
Did I ask you to explain?
You said why am I?
Or what am I doing?
No --
"Well, what am I doing, you said."
"That's right, kicking your feet."
I didn't ask you to explain.
It's your imagination.
"But we can't take it back  Late regrets, So don't cry"
Love you were different I know now that you changed me

"Hello, LOEN TV  viewers"
Thank you.
Hey interwebs.
"It's Thursday September 17, 2009 and a viewer informs me as of September 15th,"
I have been on YouTube for 3 years.
3 Mo-Fricken' years.
And a lot's changed since 3 years ago.
I'm no longer that person.
"A lot of people will say, ""Man, yeah time flies."""
No... 3 years ago feels like an entire lifetime away.
I was a completely different person then.
I would personally say a worse person.
A person I wouldn't be friends with right now.
"And back then I was just some douchebag witha camera, and now..."
Well I just get paid to be a douchebag with a camera.
And the conversation over the years has given me a lot of insight.
Even you stupid fuckers with your stupid comments.
"Like ""first""..."
Which shows me that even if  you're the first to the show it doesn't necessarily mean you're the winner.
Sometimes it just means you're an asshole.
But change is all around us.
"I mean, given time, a lot of things can change."
Peoples' perception of those things change with it.
"I mean, look at Lindsay Lohan."
She was adorable.
Then she was hot.
Then she was crazy.
Then she was kinda crazy hot.
Now she just looks like a coked out whore.
So still kinda hot.
Lindsay Lohan is kind of my dirty secret.
"If I was single, I would possibly  have sex with Lindsay Lohan."
"Right now some of you are judging me, but I would have sex with Lindsay Lohan for the same reason that I love skydiving."
"We will show you  our first ballad song,'crying'"
Thank you
A day without you I can't do anything
Never No more
Even if I regret it  It's all done now
I don't have the courage to Take it back
You come to me secretly And shake me again gently
Oh no Oh no Don't hold my heart
I feel like a fool looking at  You and crying
Oh no Oh no  This is not love
"Love, like nothing happened  Like I never loved"
I can't do that  Crying Crying
"Love, even if I try to take it back  Me without you"
Endlessly Crying crying
I open my eyes  You're nowhere
I brush my eyes and look for you But you are not there
I close my eyes and open it again  But you're still not there
I thought it would  be okay without you
But I look at the  memories we had
"Tears and memories that are  Falling out, it's all finished"
For You and Me
You come to me secretly And shake me again gently
Oh no Oh no Don't hold my heart
I feel like a fool looking at  You and crying
Oh no Oh no  This is not love
"Love, like nothing happened  Like I never loved"
I can't do that  Crying Crying
"Love, even if I try to take it back  Me without you"
Endlessly Crying crying
"No, this is not me I used to know"
"I'm going to be okay, I know Whenever I breathe  I hate you"
I can't sleep at night  Telling myself it's okay
"Because Faruk is lying,... because Faruk is an unreliable man."
"Ah,Selim..-An hour long he was droning ""No i'm not a thief,no the business went wrong ""... ..."
"""No, don't worry , when i get the money, i'll pay back..."""
""" Is it not so?"
Couldn't he tell this on the phone?
He wanted to talk face to face - And with it we are alright !
"Again, he wanted to ask for money from you.. and when he saw me, gave up that idea."
And he is taking me for a fool... as i don't understand his mind..
Again he did a wrong calculation.
He couldn't guess we would come together of course.
"It 's enough now, Selim.- And you, if I were not there when he called you, would you tell me? would you tell me come,we go together?"
He is even calling you to come to the hotel..Impertinent( Inappropriate.)
"What is there, he did not want to be seen."
"Anyway you're the lawyer of the other side, but don't forget a common friend of ours is in a very difficult situation."
"Okay, i know, you're right, see you."
"Yes, Burcu."
Okay i know i'm late.
I am on my way.
I am coming to the office.
What?...
"Oh, No..."
Which hospital?
"I am not crazy, I am not crazy man!"
I am not crazy.
Untie me!
"Find my lawyer, let my brother come to me."
"Man is okay, be quiet... - Leave me, i'm not crazy.."
Man i am not mad...
Leave me!
"Untie me ,i'm not crazy- Stop man, stop,they left.."
You will get mad by force!
Did they really inform my lawyer?-Yes they did..&amp;gt; Good...
"I said, ""I don't know."
"Why?"""
"And they said, ""It's really important."
"You gotta get it out of here."""
"So they talk to the pilot and aircraft commander and he came over and he said, ""Brian what do you think?"""
"Or, BJ, they called me."
"""Can you haul that thing?"""
"I was looking at it and there was a master sergeant there and stuff and said, ""What is it?"""
"He said, ""I can't tell you what's in it."
"But it has to be out of here, because they've having trouble..."""
That's that real hard area in Pakistan right now.
All the troubles and everything.
There were troubles back then.
"So, there was an old"
CG marked out with the circle and an X in it for
Center of Gravity.
"So, I said, ""Well, is that accurate?"""
"He said, ""Well, I don't know."""
"I said, ""Hey, listen, if you want me to haul it, I have to know pretty close because... the plane is big and touchy on this, you know."""
"He said, ""There's probably weight on both ends."""
"I said, ""What's it weigh?"""
"There was like 20-22,000 pounds on it."
"He said, ""We probably added a couple 3,000."""
"I said, ""Okay, I don't care what's in it."
You can have sugar in it.
I don't care what's in it.
"But I do have to know if it can hold it."""
"So he says that, so I said I can fly it - I can haul it."
We had a load of stuff.
We ran that stuff back down to
Karachi and then they'd ship it out there in boats and stuff like that.
Flew back up to
"I would be on Facebook, or worse,"
MySpace.
The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height.
"A cube with side x has length x, width x, and height x."
"So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third."
Shane takes a big cube of butter with side length 5 from the fridge.
"So I'm assuming-- well, they're not giving us the units."
Maybe it's 5 centimeters.
With side length 5 from the fridge.
Maybe I'll go with 5 centimeters.
That seems reasonable.
Then he cuts out a little cube of side length 2 from one of the corners of the cube.
Write an expression that describes the volume of butter left.
So let's think about it.
The original volume of butter that was-- they're saying side length 5.
I'm visualizing it as 5 centimeters.
"Its volume is going to be 5 times 5 times 5, which we could just write as 5 to the third power."
And then he takes out a little chunk from that.
And the volume that he takes out is the volume of that little cube.
And that little cube has side length 2.
So its volume is going to be 2 times 2 times 2.
Or another way of writing that is 2 to the third power.
So it's going to be 5 to the third minus 2 to the third.
Why are we doing this?
Where are we going?
Why?!
What?!
Oohh!
We're in Paris!
"Yes, exactly, why don't we just stop and enjoy it?"
Just look.
Oh my God!
Oh man!
[Laughing]
- Burrow is done and there they go!
"- Totally sick, Tasteless."
"- Beautiful, he is attempting to push forward here hoping that the fact he can just overrun the ramp, since the Hydras deal so much damage."
"- Yeah, he has two Infestors as well."
This is going to be wild.
"If he can get the Hydras that is all he needs to do, just blow those up."
- Oh my God!
- There are so many Baneling landmines right now Tasteless.
- Ohhhhhh...
Ohhhhhh!!!
- Absolutely sick!
And the Mutas will clean up everything else!
I got the sickest nerd chills right now Tasteless.
Absolutely beautiful!
"-	There is a DT on the natural actually, delaying the Command Center, can pick off another SCV, and the scan has to be used here."
And Alicia is using them so well!
"-	And you know what, he's gotta use the Scan off of this Orbital right here, so he has to land it."
But the DT!
"Moving into position preventing the landing, he stopped the Missile Turret."
Oh My God!
"Alicia, absolutely shutting down MarineKingPrime here with a single DT."
"He is going to surround the Missile Turret, it is going to get up, and Alicia's timing is so impeccable!"
He moves that DT away.
"He knows that he is in a lot of trouble, but we are going to see him moving forward."
"There is the DT's warped in, nothing here to help his army, he has to get his Orbital landed."
-	Is he going to get a Stalker..
He blinks!
He blinks under the Orbital!
Oh My God!
All of us.

Why not?

It's so dark.
I don't know.

I'm really busy.

Hi today I am going to tell you about three different kinds of pasta.
The first pasta I am going to tell you about is capellini.
"CAP-A-LEAN-E, also known as angel hair."
This pasta is long and thin.
The second pasta I am going to tell you about is spaghetti.
"SPA-GET-EE, spaghetti is similar to capellini in that it is long and thin, but it is a little bit thicker than capellini."
The third pasta I am going to tell you about is linguini.
LlN-GEEN-EE.
Linguini also means little tongues.
Linguini is flat and long and thin.
So next time you're ordering pasta you will know just what to ask for.

"Good morning,"
"It's time to have breakfast, monkey."
ls it tomorrow already?
"No, it's only today yet."
But you already had breakfast?
"You're going to lift one hand and one foot, tap."
"Then the other hand and the other foot, tap."
So see how the both come up and down at the same time?
I want you to try it.
OK ready?
Great job!
OK we're going to put one foot on the line here and put this foot on the carpet.
And we're going to put our hands on our hips and we're going to walk and put one foot in front of the other.
"OK we're going to come over and put one foot on the balance beam hands on our hips, and we're going to look at the target in front of us."
We're going to lift this foot behind us with our toe pointed towards the ground and you're going to stand on the balance beam on one leg until I tell you to stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Good.
Thank you.
We're going to try this activity one more time.
I just want to make sure you keep that one leg up behind you and look at the target until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Thank you.
We're going to come over and we're going to bring this leg up behind us again with our hands on our hips and we're going to jump.
You're going to jump on the end of the line here until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
And stop.
You're going to catch it after it bounces once OK?
Like that.
You're going to catch the ball with two hands until I say stop.
-Soft taco.
-[Elmo voice]:
Soft taco.
With sour cream and a Pepsi.
"-I want a chalupa, with no lettuce or tomato."
-A little chalupa.
No lettuce or tomato
And I need a number nine again with no sour cream.
"-Yeah, well, that's not a bad Elmo impression."
"Yeah, the video's funny, it's a decent prank I admit it."
"The video's now at over a 100,000 views and it's gaining fast."
"But you know, my question is, what the f--k is Elmo doing at Taco Bell?"
"I always just assumed that Elmo was on a strict diet of, you know, sunshine and unicorn meat."
"But no, he apparently eats the sh--ty Mexican food that even real Mexicans don't even eat."
"Now if you listen closely at the end of the video, you can actually hear the cashier laughing."
-Elmo needs lemonade.
-Lemonade?
"-Yes, ma'am."
-[laughs]
-Let's be honest.
The cashier finds it funny.
She's probably high too.
You know this is probably the best thing to happen to a Taco Bell worker since that f--king chihuahua died.
"Yeah, I do have one criticism though."
"You know, Elmo's a Muppet and it would've been ten times funnier if another Muppet had answered back like,"
"""Uh, this is Kermit the Frog here and you need to take your punk-ass back to Burger King."""
"Or, if Liza Minnelli worked there and was suddenly like,"
-Balls to you!
-But I didn't order any balls.
"Well, you're getting 'em."
But you know what probably did order balls?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bam!, and he said..."
"You could have dropped me by the subway, you didn't listen to me and got stuck in this traffic down the drain."
"Oh , don't prolong it.-You 'il miss your lesson."
I still have time.
I will take you to your neighborhood... and I will also see the place where you lived.
There is nothing to see...
"I mean, you can't look at things there as you look to an aquarium. .."
what sort of a man are you?
You take out your spines right away..
Do I want to look at your life as one looks an aquarium?
Is that the way you see me?
No... of course not..
Last night I told you my secrets.
"I put my head on your shoulder, I trusted your sincerity."
"Should I think "" I wonder if..."""
Okay i am sorry... - But you are are doing it always. .
"Whenever I want to come close to you, you push me away.."
Last night it happened the same way...
"Why do you hide yourself so much, I don't understand."
I mean what are you afraid of?
You put on your armor right away!
Why are you afraid?
What harm can I do to you?
Get out of the car then!
"Get out, if you don't want my friendship, don't look at my face from now on."
What's all this now?
"Ok, come on, let's go, I will show you every place, but you won't insist saying:"
"""I will see your home"""
Why can't I see your home?
Because I want to forget the way to it too!
Don't you miss your mom?
I will get out! &amp;gt; Okay!
There left..
Gossip magazine:
Mister ASK left a broken heart behind him again.
Go straight on from here!
"We came until here but you didn't see anyone, if you want to meet any friend or something like that, I can wait or I can go..."
No thanks!
-Don't you have a friend or you don't want to meet with anyone?
I don't have friends.
To the left!
The guy from the meatballs place?
He is my brother's friend.
"Come on, jump out here!- Papa, at least you could drop me by the shop.."
Tell the master I will be back late from the test.
"I understood, you're going away again!"
"Man, get out, I am in a hurry.- Come on, go on, quick, quick.!"
Why did that boy upset you today?
He talked a bit rudely.
I don't like him that much.
Did he say something bad?&amp;gt; No.
Do you do it intentionally?&amp;gt; What?
"You say a thing, then you keep mum for a while.As if I make you talk by force."
You tell everything half...
It's because I have nothing to tell.
You saw my life... there is nothing else good except the meatballs.
You're doing an injustice.
"Err... you're not late for your lesson, are you?"
I still have time.
We fell again here...
"It's okay, no problem..."
Do you have lessons every weekday-Two days in a week.
There was a school you mentioned the other day... did you get an answer from it?
No Word from there.
But even if they don't accept me I won't be so surprised.
What happened?
What did they say? &amp;gt; Why? &amp;gt; Tell us Yaman!
Later.
"Come on,Mert!"
"What's happening?- I have something to do, I will solve it and be back."
Come on man!
You will take the exam.- I will come until then
"What can be more important than exam? &amp;gt; Yaman!- I will come, don't worry!"
Your exam is at 3 o'clock you have to be her at 2:30.
Can it be that the interview was bad?
Wait for me..
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
"Hello, can I come in?"
"Please Mr. Selim, you're welcome.- I won't take your time..."
I wanted to ask how was the interview?
Take a sit.
Don't say it wasn't brilliant.
"Actually as you said, Yaman is a very intelligent boy."
He shows this with the grades from the previous exams but...
"But... -I don't like these ""but-s"" at all ...by God,"
Really..- I don't think he is suitable for this school.
He is a tensed boy and I found him emotional too. which one of us wasn't like that in that age?
"Yaman is very intelligent, very wise and... hardworking..."
"A determined boy,"
I believe that if he has an opportunity he will be very successful .
Be sure..&amp;gt; You did what you could about him Selim.
After this he will find the opportunity for himself on his own.
According to the grade he will get in the last exam otherwise...
I don't even want to think about a contrary possibility!
Have an easy work!
"Master, I need 1000 TL urgently!"
1000 TL??- As an advance payment. you will cut it from my weekly salary.
Good catch.
"Alright, alright."
So now let's shift some stuff.
"Shift happens, you guys just deal with it."
"So here we go, shift to everybody."
Let's shift.
We're going to we're going to shift E2.
Ready?
We're going to make it back to E3.
I don't have enough time to do it.
Here's how it's going to work.
And let's just see if you.
Are chill with this?
"I grab the first one and -one components of u two and I should make it second to n com, second to n components."
Sorry.
That should be.
"So I take the first one through n minus one of e two and make it the second n component here, and then finish this off I take the last component of e two and make it."
The first component.
Of E3.
And I'm going to drop E3.
Right here and this is at one.
Go.
There it is.
"See that I just took this, shifted it up, dropped it down."
"Alright let's finish this off, let me take this row here, this E4 and I am going to shift it down one over here and I do this the following way."
"I say I'm going to make the vector E5 and the way this is worth the same way, two and one is equal to E4."
"And, the first component is the last component."
And I put this E5 right.
"Right over here no p5, p5, and this is at, minus then plus, plus one."
And if I spy that.
There it is.
This is the matrix we built in class.
Really?Tell whether the allegations are true !
"You stole a truck,didn t you?"
"Okay, I understand... we have decided tobring Mahir Karato trial,"
He will remain in hospitaluntil it recovers and then we will take himto prisonuntil the next hearing.
You can go out .
"I could startwith the caseyou were talking about with Mr. Prosecutor,"
So Icould prove...
For this person who is on trial for murderand risks to be sentenced to death...
What? ?
Who do you think you are ?Huh?
Who do you think you areto be able to search for such an important case?
"One of the most important figuresin this country, was killed... killedMy friend and colleague..."
"Do not you ever playwith something about which you have no idea,and want to prove ityou are smart!"
Do you understand?dont Do it again!
Did you knowState Prosecutor?
Do you have any ideawho could kill him?
You with your level of knowledgeyou want to solve it ?!
"Boss,we have not found it yet."
"We've searched,but nothing. he fellinto a black hole!"
He fell!- And then what?
"But we""il find him"
"he can not escape. you will turn everything upside down until you find him,don""t you?"
"Behold, the warrior, you find Ibo or I'll kill you all."
"Now I have somewhere to go,I leave you all to worry about it ."
"All right, boss."
Brother...once again we go back...
Feride hasclose all the doorsfor me and my father...
"She'll hang my father,and throw me in jail..."
"Feride has decided,I know that."
"We'll find a way,do not worry."
"There is no moreno way,bro..."
Just one...
It depends what this bx term does.
"But if we look at the choices, the only choice that intercepts the y-axis below the x-axis at a negative y-intercept and opens down is choice A."
"There's only three choices that open down, and only choice A intercepts in the negative area, so the answer is A."
"It actually looks eerily like what I drew, just out of the blue."
Next question.
Problem number 12.
"OK, so they drew a square."
"And I will draw a square, because they drew a square."
"And they say this is A, this is B, this is C, D."
And this is P.
This is Q.
And out here is R.
"I don't know where this problem's going, but it looks interesting."
"Figure not drawn to scale, of course."
"In the figure above, ABCD is a rectangle, with"
BC is equal to 4.
AB is equal to 6.
"P, Q, and R are different points on a line, not shown, that is parallel to AD."
"So P, Q, and R are apparently all on the same line that is parallel to AD."
"Well, I guess that is the way they drew it."
So let me erase.
Let's just say this is Q.
That R is down here.
This isn't R.
So they're all on the same line.
"And they say the line isn't shown, but it's parallel to AD."
So let me draw that line.
So that line looks something like this.
Let me draw it straight.
"And on that line, you have P, Q, and R, and it is parallel to AD."
Good enough.
Points P and Q are symmetric about line AB.
Because.
But yeah.
"Uh, we're thinking."
Okay.
"You kno w, as."
"Responsive design, it's kind of a buzzword but it is also a necessity."
"Um, and..."
"And lot of designers are now saying, well, everything I design, by default has to be responsive."
And now it's fine when you're starting fresh.
"But um, when you have to look behind you what's already been done since, you know, in a lot of cases."
Your content.
The content you are working with has existed since the beginning of internet.
And things were not pretty then.
Oh no.
"In fact, we still have sites that look like 1993."
"And that was my biggest, even iii..."
"Ah, I have no doubt."
"But we're not going to redesign another 1993 looking website with all those blocks and squares. we gotta get away from that, please."
Yeah.
To try to be a little more hip.
"In fact, the girl was just showing us ."
"We, we were looking at, um, presentation on the"
"Tuesday on of the pages that they had ah, doing test on."
"And, and that was one of the web comments there."
"I said, yeah, yeah."
"You don't have to stick with those 1995. , Mm-hm."
"No. , I said, oh no, is he? see how terrible we are."
"We are like the, we've got to get, we've got to get this stuff."
"I mean, they have some of the coolest science around and they show it and."
And those interval waves sometimes.
"I mean, our site looks pretty good."
"Um, cause we did the redesign at MPS and stuff."
"The kind of artists . ,, ."
I said I know they're on here somewhere cuz I watched a really good one.
"Cuz I, I only got to it through the newsletter that's why, I, I saw I clicked and went to that, you know greatest artists or something like that."
But then that's why I'm actually going to find him.
"Like what do, what do they have that under?"
"The documentary to me is uh, is kind of more like the."
Plus something for me to learn how to do a documentary.
"Uh, right."
Yeah.
"Which is, it actually being an inspiration story."
"Huh, that makes sense."
"Right, of artists."
And a featured artist or something like that would be a great place for a start.
Okay.
This is so helpful.
"You know, sometimes we just get so insular in how we loko at information that it's so helpful to hear how other people."
Consume.
Right.
"Well like I said if I meet with engineering teams, and we always get to see it then."
"It's a terrible job on your, on your back."
"Um, people like to go hiking and stuff and there's , too."
"Oh. ,, , so even we, we don't a very good job on stuff. ."
Yeah.
"We all do the best we can, and then we re-evaluate and start again."
Right.
"Yeah, but you had some good stuff too.'Cause my Dad said I'm, I'm creative on the outside ."
"I do children's illustrations, and things like that."
"So you have, like, some children's book illustrator."
Mm hm.
Programs.
The illustrating stuff is good.
I don't think .
"Detroit and I started going down there, well then that changed that."
She had a good job at [?].
She was the [?]
Detroit area automobile association
They must have a hundred dealers
But she came back to Grand Rapids and we got married and that was it.
Picked up a couple of part time jobs.
And then when the kids got in high school
She didn't work until after they were in high school
And then she started out with a part-time job.
The kids were working part-time.
They went to [?] and Catholic Central
Worked janitor work over at the school and different things
No problem.
They're good workers.
Few grey hairs but that happens.
They didn't get in jail.
So they're both doing good and I'm doing good but we came up here every summer.
We rented over at Archie's.
Archie's Place is there.
We rented there for 30 years.
Even though I'd had some property up where [?] is and I sold it to him and bought this.
What year did you buy this property?
"Let's see, we built in"
"'98, so probably bought it in '94, maybe."
"So, when you say you never left the island?"
"I went some, like, 28 St. Patrick's Days and never missed one."
You never missed a funeral or a wedding or vacations.
We worked 4-day weeks at Spartan so you could switch.
You could work Sunday to Wednesday one week and
"Tuesday to Friday the next, or something like that and get a 4-day weekend to shoot up here pretty easy."

Luminus Devastatus is a spell that priests unlock at the level 100.
"Yes but with the update version, it can set up a new deal."
"No, no, no, I have checked twice."
"No, wait, it's better to :"
Bandaid !
"Come here my boy, come !"
"What's going on dudes, are we going to do a new quest ?"
"No, no ,no."
We just want to know where did you got that beautiful staff.
The staff ?
"But I already told you, on Dardane."
"No, that cannot be Bandaid."
Dardane doesn't loot this kind of item.
"Yes he does, and it's Golgotha who killed him right in front of me."
"And when she left, she said she didn't need this kind of item, so I took it for myself."
"- Yeah, me, I think he is lying."
- Why would he lie ?
"I don't know, perhaps he bought the staff from Ash the chinese farmer."
And he doesn't dare to say it.
I am not Chinese !
You really think behind his blank stare there's enough grey cells to bamboozle us ?
Yes. good point.
"However, nothing can explain how the worse priest from Horizon 1.0 is able to cast level 100 spells."

And even Tenshirock the hacker has said that I was super whacking of the dead.
He also said that I was the Chosen one !
"Wait, when did you see Tenshirock the hacker ?"
I tried a little college.
Picked up a job.
Which was dumb.
I was making about five hundred with my flight pay in the Air Force...
Took a job for a hundred a week when I got out.
I would...
I'd go there for seven years and...
Driving truck where now?
"Oh, just a laundry truck all over Western Michigan."
"We had all the Kroger stores and all the Spartan stores under contract, with aprons and towels, and..."
With Richie Gillespie?
"No, with Richie O'Donnell."
"One of the drivers got hurt, and he knew I was looking for better pay."
And I'd always bonded with him and I went there
I drove there for 7 years.
"I got there, there were 32 drivers, and when they got laid off they were down to - I think it was either 9 or 11."
Synthetic stuff.
"Synthetic smocks, table covers"
"Restaurants quit using cloth napkins and cloth table covers, and the fancy banquet covers, and that was our main business."
"The guys retired, and they'd just never fill them in and never did, and never did."
"So, 7 years later, I was..."
I went to... a year and a half and got a big layoff there.
"'75, I think it was."
What were you doing for Steel Case?
I just worked the shipping department
I was in shipping - file shipping.
"And when I left there - I was laid off from there, and of course, Steel Case always called back, back then, back in the 70s"
I couldn't get a job.
"I was working 3 jobs, $2.50 an hour."
Bartending on weekends for the Amvets.
Because they wanted a guy there Friday and Saturday.
Mowing grass for another guy for $2.50 an hour.
What's a joke now?
"No, I'm afraid you're going to notice everything I do."
Gee!
I don't --
Do you want me to?
"I want you to help me become more relaxed, yes, but I don't want to be so defensive with you."
I don't like to feel so defensive.
"Uh...you're acting like -- you're treating me as if I'm stronger than I am, and I want you to... protect me more, and be nicer to me."
Are you aware of your smile?
You don't believe a word you're saying.
[laughs]
"I do too, and I know you're going to pick on me for it!"
"Sure, you're bluffing, a phony."
Do you believe -- you mean that seriously?
"Yeah, if you say you're afraid and you laugh and you giggle and you squirm...that's phony."
You put on a performance for me.
"Oh, I...I resent that very much."
Can you express this?
"Yes, sir."
I most certainly am not being phony.
I will admit this.
"It's hard for me to show my embarrassment, and I hate to be embarrassed, but, boy, I resent you calling me a phony."
Just because I smile when I'm embarrassed or
"I'm put in the corner, does not mean I'm being a phony."
Wonderful.
Thank you.
You did this work for the last minute.
"Well, I'm really mad at you."
That's right.
You didn't have to cover up your anger with your smile.
"Now in that moment, in that minute, you had not a not a [indiscernible]"
"Well, at that minute I was mad at you though,"
On edge.
"Frustrated, 'cause I was like, ""Where is the paper?"""
I was pretty creeped out.
"Very, very scared."
Scared.
How else would I feel?
Am I supposed to be happy or something?
The sounds they had
I didn't think were going to affect me as much as they did.
"Just, ""Boom."""
Just constant bass is just nerve-racking.
"(Finebros) So, the villain in the game is called Slender Man, which is an Internet meme that's been around for a while that some people have even started to like to say is real."
"Oh, my gosh."
(Finebros) And people will post pictures of sightings of the Slender Man.
Someone just walked by.
"(chuckling) Oh, my god."
(Finebros) What have you seen?
What do you know about the Slender Man mythology or whatever?
"It was like some mythological creature, and it was like this man who's really tall with a suit and everything and no face."
He was there before mankind.
"He kidnapped children and whatnot, and there's, like, several accounts of it too."
"Like, there was this picture--"
"Oh, God, I just got chills from it."
I don't like it.
There's this picture of a park and there's a bunch of kids.
"In the picture, he has four or five arms, and the kids in the picture later on went missing."
Those are just Photoshopped.
I've seen those pictures.
Photoshop.
"Oh, my God."
(Finebros) What is it about the Slender Man that is making people care so much that they're creating so much content about him?
He's scary and people seem to like being scared.
It's fantastic every step of the way.
Dorm life is great.
"I love, love living here."
It's a great way to meet new people.
It's alot of fun.
You make so many new friends.
I have a big room.
That's nice.
Living in the dorms is probably where I've met the most diverse group of people.
"Here at U.R.I., we have this thing called the Living and Learning Community."
I lived in the Living Learning Community at Morrow.
"If you need help, you'd go to your neighbors."
"If you have some kind of random question, all you'd have to do is poke your head out the hallway and ask someone, which is so convenient."
Chances are somebody else will understand it.
The food's phenomenal I really like how we have a variety of food.
The grilled cheese.
I have never had onion rings like I have at home.
Well I'd definitely say that my favorite food in the stir fry.
The stir fry.
"They're crispy, the onions are soft."
I like to get the omelettes at Butterfield.
"On weekdays, there's omelettes."
All you can eat buffet.
"Its alot of variety, there's alot of options here on campus."
I like to put yogurt and granola and banana in a bowl and mix it up.
It's healthy if you're trying to eat healhty.
"Usually every Friday, it's nacho night."
"There's plenty of pizza and chicken nuggets, everything a college student needs."
I love the campus.
I fell in love with the campus.
A ton of nice people here.
"You can't help but smile, it's so nice here."
"- Oh, God!"
He's right there!
- (chuckles)
"- (laughs and curses) - Oh, he has tentacles!"
Oh!
I never saw that before.
What?
Poor guy.
(Finebros) Why are people uploading videos of themselves getting scared?
"Uh, 'cause it's hilarious."
All YouTube videos-- the reason they upload it is to get views.
"(Finebros) Do you think that everyone was being legit scared, or were some of them pretending to be scared?"
"I feel like a lot of them were exaggerating,"
"'cause if they were videotaping themselves, they knew what was happening."
"Tobuscus, I felt the after part was a little overdone."
But I bet you most of the people are legitimately scared.
"(Finebros) So, this game is a fairly simple game and there's not much to it and it's short, but it's so popular."
"Why do people love playing ""Slender""?"
"I didn't love playing ""Slender."""
"I don't know why people love playing ""Slender."""
"Because it's so hard to win and it's so fun to play because of the suspense, I guess."
"There's not a whole lot to do with it, so, like, anyone can play it."
"The simplicity of it could, like, attract them."
It attracts a lot of people that maybe aren't into gaming that--
- (cracks up) - (Finebros) There's nothing there!
"People like to be scared, you know?"
People like to have that adrenaline rush.
I don't do well with scary movies.
"I got nightmares from ""Harry Potter."""
"(Finebros) And what advice would you give to somebody who is about to play ""Slender"" for the first time?"
Just don't do it.
Just don't.
"I, I think, I like how, that you guys are ."
"The teacher organizes nice, and bookmarks things and stuff."
"I think that's a great idea, so I can always go back to."
"It is, and also I, I haven't had a smart phone for very long."
Um-hm.
And I was surprised.
I went on there and that was really good.
"And it actually had the, uh."
"And then actually be able to watch it um, ."
Oh cool.
Yeah.
At first it had a mobile version on it.
Yep.
Beta something.
I. Yep.
So the first time I had ever looked at it and actually that worked really nicely so the mobile when .
And we have to.
"That's the way the world is going. ,, ."
"I wanna let, I mean I haven't installed, I haven't used it very frequently for that kind of purpose."
I still have my old .
"I, I'm like, wow."
"We always having to do that stiff, stuff as well, and uh you guys did that pretty nicely, the way it sits on it, ?"
"Are you, as you're looking at the USGS."
"Uh, we."
Redo.
Mm hm.
Are you talking about responsive design and the need for mobile compatibilit y?
That's come up.
I know that the directive of the White House wants the government to start making mobile devices stuff and there is a plan in place.
"It's a matter of how you take all that content because there is a lot of it, there is a large bit of it."
"It's really, it's very hard to design for it because they do every science in the world, right?"
Every type of science?
"I was hanging out with my sister the other day and I was, I was sitting in this chair, and my sister told me to stop fidgeting."
"To which I was like, A, rude, and B, I'm not fidgeting."
"I just, I really like sitting in different ways."
And I do.
"You know, if you know something about me, you know that."
So I thought I'd just quickly show you guys my favorite ways to sit on a chair.
"So to do this, I just need like, I need a chair, this one, this will do."
"I'll use this one, this will be fine."
"Basically, I mean, we can start with just a simple, a classic cheeks on the seat maneuver."
I really like to center myself.
"So I'm like, in position to sit down."
"Then I just, then I go from right here just to plopping down."
"And it, you know, like, it takes a little settling in on the sit bones to like, really find the comfort spot."
Some people find it right away.
"I have to search for it a little bit, and then you're"
"like, this is it."
And then that's it.
And you stay there.
Second move is just a little-- you guys know it.
It's the leg cross.
Knee over knee.
"I like to sit, I like to cross to the left."
"It's nice way to get, like a bit of a stretch in the glutes, as well as generally air out the situation."
There's nothing worse than a sweaty sit butt during a long meeting.
That's the worst.
"So I just, those are two."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Hi, Beth."
BETH HOYT:
Julie.
"Julie Klauser, everybody."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else?
I was born with some form of disease.
Voice:
What kind of disease?
BP:
I was born old.
Man:
I'm sorry.
BP:
No need to be.
There's nothing wrong with old age.
Girl:
Are you sick?
BP:
"I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon."
But ... maybe not.
Girl:
You're different than anybody I've ever met.
BB:
"There were many changes ... some you could see, some you couldn't."
"Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things."
"I felt pretty good, considering."
Ed Ulbrich:
"That was a clip from ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."""
"Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story, but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film, the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt, is completely computer-generated from the neck up."
"Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body."
We've created a completely digital human head.
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
"Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director."
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
Please....
"Okay, here's the deal."
I have an explanation for### this picture
I'm gonna back it up as soon as this hooker comes in here and tells you she's not with the mayor last night
Having the police pick her up right now.
On what charge?
"I don't know, James."
Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope she does soemthing illegal while she's trying to get people to pay her to have sex
Don't bother Mike
I already talked to her.
"And she 's already writing a book detailing### her 5 year-relationship with the mayor, sorry buddy"
"Carter, do something"
"So, we still on### for tonight?"
"She's lying, Jason."
How could you possibly know that?
Do you have some kind of alibi?
No.
I don't
Mike's mom is the perfect alibi
Should I go remind him?
Only if you're bucking#### for a promotion.
Wait a minute.
So close!
"Under three, high twos."
I had a two hour and fifty-something.
Thanks for coming!
"As Gerry said, I tried to avoid giving  this talk, but couldn't get out of it."
I came here to tell you that  I organize TEDx events.
I have three under my belt and  a fourth is due in a couple of months.
"And I do it because my Mom  inspired me to do so as her father inspired her,  to do things wholeheartedly."
"Well, it turns out that it's been  a year since she passed away."
"She had been struggling  with cancer for two years and she had a stroke three days  before my last event, which left her quadriplegic  and unable to speak or move."
"And they gave them to 1,500 people."
It's in a book called Break Point and Beyond.
"And on the protocol of the test, if you scored  above a certain level, you'd be considered to be a genius at divergent thinking."
Okay?
"So, my question to you is, what percentage of the people tested, of the 1500, scored at genius level for divergent thinking?"
You need to know one more thing about them.
These were kindergarten children.
"So, what you think?"
What percentage at genius level?
(Audience member) 80.
"(Ken Robinson) You think 80, okay."
98%.
"Now, the thing about this was, it was a longitudinal study."
"So, they retested the same children five years later."
Age of eight to ten.
What do you think?
50?
"They retested them again, five years later,  ages 13 to 15."
"You can see a trend here, can't you"
[laughter]?
"Now, this tells an interesting story."
"Because you could have imagined it going the other way, couldn't you."
"You start off not being very good, but you get better  as you get older."
But this shows two things.
"One is, we all have this capacity."
"And two, it mostly deteriorates."
"Now, a lot of things have happened to these kids as they've grown up, a lot."
"But one of the most important things that happened to them,"
"I am convinced, is that by now, they've become educated."
"They know, they spent 10 years at school being told there's one answer."
It's at the back and don't look.
"And don't copy, because that's cheating."
"I start at the beginning of each list, and I say is one less than three?"
Sure.
So that says one should be the first element in my merge list.
"Now, compare the first element in each of these lists."
"Two is less than three, so two ought to be the next element of the list."
And you get the idea.
What am I going to do next?
I'm going to compare three against four.
"Three is the smallest one, and I'm going to compare four games twelve, which is going to give me four."
And then what do?
"I have to do twelve against thirty, twelve is smaller, take that out."
"Seventeen against thirty, twenty-four against thirty And by this stage I've got nothing left in this element, so I just add the rest of that list in."
"Wow I can sort two lists, so I can merge two lists."
I said it poorly.
What's the point?
How many operations did it take me to do this?
"Seven comparisons, right?"
I've got eight elements.
"It took me seven comparisons, because I can take advantage of the fact I know I only ever have to look at the first element of each sub-list."
"Those are the only things I need to compare, and when I run out of one list, I just add the rest of the list in."
What's the order of complexity of merging?
I heard it somewhere very quietly.
STUDENT: n.
PROFESSOR:
"Sorry, and thank you."
"Linear, absolutely right?"
And what's n by the way here?
What's it measuring?
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"In both lists, right."
Do you know what goes on on the internet?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
(echo)
Are you going to learn how to use the technology?
I am a digital native.
Do computers scare you?
Are you afraid to use them?
Have you been on facebook?
Have you been on twitter?
Have you been surfing?
Do you even know what is on the internet?
Are you going to be my teacher?
Or just that textbook?
Because I want to know... what the world has to offer
And if you are not on the internet... and know nothing about computers. you can't be my teacher!
I said you can't be my teacher.

Do you really think it is possible to be an educator in the information age and not use the internet?
"Continue to pretend, maybe the internet is just a fad."
Life was sort of stressful.
I couldn't sleep because of the fact that I was always thinking about how I could pay the creditors.
One of the ways that I thought I could solve it was having a lot of jobs.
At it's peak I had six jobs.
It was hard work because I was taking my annual leave and working weekends and evenings.
They planned to and succeeded in deflect the blameto my father...
"Did you say 'they', sir."
Mahir!Who are those who want to accuse your father?
Some mobsters wanted to imposecost on store owners...
"My father and I, stopped themand protect them than from the racketeering"
We will never allowto exploit our peopleand steal their money...
We wanted to prevent these bastardsto get closer to our neighborhood...
And how did that work?Are you the police? no
I understand.
"That's what you do with force,as gangstersprotect your people, do not you?"
"My father and Iwe are not gangsters,Mr. Judge!"
"We just defendedour neighbors and their lives,their efforts..."
That's all we've done!
Whatever!...This is not a the main subject...
We will not discussthe racketeering
"I do not wantthat to mention it any longer ,Do you understand me?"
Ma'am.
"Judge,It is very important for the trial..."
"That is not in the file,let's go back to our case..."
You are invited todayto witnessabout what you know about the relationship of your fatherand your biological motherand where are you in all this!
"Mrs. Judge,you will ask me if my fatherwas an enemy of the late Mr. Sulaiman!"

When the guests left the pupil was alone and he started to think
First he thought:
"""Where should I look to?... yet... to all the sides: upwards and downwards, in breadth and deep down to the left and to the right, forward and backwards expands a pointless space of our arythmic efforts and claims"
"So, which side sould I look at?"
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER.
Mother gave 1 rouble to the pupil.
"And told him to buy 3 packs of milk 16 copecks each and 1 long loaf of ""RlGA"" bread, if there will be one."
AND WHAT IF THERE WON'T BE ANY???
"Then, buy a half of any ""black"" (rye) bread, but a fresh one!"
The pupil has done everything as the mother told him.
"He has bought 2 packs of milk and a half of ""Borodinsky"" bread"
"Since the ""RlGA"" bread WASN'T THERE!!!!!"
When he came home the pupil has given the purchase to the mother and the change left from 1 rouble
But not all of it!
The mother has allowed him to keep the copper coins
The pupil took a place near the window and started to think
First he though:
"""Twelve per night!?"
"Around 100 - 120... """
Then he thougt:
"""The circle is outlined."
"And nowere to go..."""
"""But if to think properly, the is always one correct solution"""
"At the same time other voices are persistenly saying, that YOU are not alone here."
You have to appeal to more of their senses in your teaching.
You should almost check a checklist.
"OK, we got sound going on, all right."
Hearing?
Hearing.
What am I doing on visual?
Am I doing any art work?
What am I doing on touch?
Am I getting their hands engaged?
All of that.
I think that happens a lot in the elementary or lower grades.
"And we figure high school, they don't need to do that anymore."
"And I think we're very, very wrong."
It's really the first time Adam Dunning has any positive feelings about
learning.
I feel good about going to school.
"I mean, school here is fun."
It's like the teachers care.
They help you out like regular school should be.
He has come to believe jail time is actually good for him.
Me being locked up was good for a learning experience for me.
"Because if I stayed out, if I didn't get locked up, I'd probably be dead or in a lot worse trouble."
I probably wouldn't be at a treatment facility.
I'd probably be back wearing an orange suit.
"For years, Adams says, he used drugs and alcohol to blunt the pain of his failures in school."
He's clean and sober now but worries about how long that can
last.
"The only thing I'm really afraid of going back to school are the kids around me, pressures."
They seen me before.
The know how I acted before.
I never been to high school when I was clean.
"I mean, it wasn't 30 days where I wasn't using."
"How can I say, you don't learn only the things written in books, but also you prepared for life."
I heard like that.
I know it like that.
Isn't that so?
You learn to differentiate the wrong from good.
"You don't have a diploma only, but also have a specialty that everyone would ask from you."
What kind of privilege is this?
"The simplest one, diploma from here opens many doors for you, you find a job easily, you establish your life even easier... you have a chance to reach your dreams."
This school provides possibilities like this.
So you want an opportunity?
Who doesn't want?
"Good, but what's your dream?"
I want to be a man.
What else can I ask?
Which profession do you want to choose Yaman?
I want to be an architect.
I want to draw the houses where people will be living.
I want it to be like this.
Shall we do something after the registration?
Okay.&amp;gt; But can't let me down at the last moment!
"No, I promise!"
But first let's get these things done.
"The school ambient hit me, I am in a huff in two minutes."
~Mira calling...
Yes sweetie.- Orkun where are you?
"I am at school, what happened?-I need you, can you come to me for a little?"
Where are you?
"By the seaside.- Why are you crying, what happened?"
I started a nightmare day...
I took my car from the sequestration police a little before.
This is all I can tell you.
"Oh no ! &amp;gt; My dad said, take it away quickly."
"-What the (bleep) is happenin', forum?"
"Listen, if you have a girlfriend, don't put her  on an ATV and make her ramp things."
-(man) Here we go.
Oh-ho!
(laughing):
Oh no!
-And wouldn't it be polite to make sure she  hasn't broken her neck before you start laughing?
"I mean, look at that."
I think she may have actually kissed her own ass.
"(man in video laughing) Yeah, you hear this dumbass laughing?"
"Epic boyfriend FAlL man, really."
Are you guys ready for it?
Are you guys ready for the cutest six seconds ever!!
Ever!!
"That you'll ever!! see in your life, ever?!!"
Check it out.
So damn cute!
"That's actually a viral video back from 2007, but, I mean, look at them."
"I want that one, that one, that one, and that one."
"But not that one, 'cause he looks like an (bleep)hole."
"Seriously though, cutest furry little bastards ever!!"
"All right, this last video, it's simple, it's incredible, it's tragic..."
"You know, just watch."
(imitates crash)
"Now, this video really bothers me."
Mainly because the woman isn't doing stupid.
"She isn't playing with gasoline, she isn't drag-racing, she isn't playing with sharp objects, but yet she still gets hurt."
And I feel so bad for her... that I'm actually still gonna do the super slow-motion replay over the funny voiceover.
"-(high-pitched voiceover singing) Stack these cans, all day long"
Stack these cans While I sing this song
"Hey, I didn't know creamed corn is on sale..."
Whoa!
So
I think kids are going to push my buttons.
"And that's the thing that scares me the most about going back to school, just the other kids."
"After three short months, Adam is starting again at Boston High."
His brief success in the jail classroom is a stark contrast to what he is about to face.
It's like asking a baby to read.
And I said it was like to trying to make gold out of straw like Rumpelstiltskin.
And mom said it was like trying to make silk purse out of--
Adam is still well below grade level and Doctor Andrea Weiss worries that there is nothing in place to help him.
"When I went back to test him, he hadn't made any progress."
But he shouldn't have.
There was no way for him to make progress because he needs specialized instruction.
He's not going to get it by osmosis.
"He's not going to stand in a room and it's going to, you know, kind of go through his pores."
It's not going to happen.
"He needs somebody to say, look, this is the way to do it."
This is the structure.
This is the recipe.
It works every time.
And then he'll own it.
What's that called?
Food chain.
Exactly.
Food chain.
Adam has been placed in two Special Ed classes.
"But the kids here have such a wide variety of learning problems, that, ironically, Adam appears to be doing better than he really is."
An element in all organisms is--
Carbon.
"Carbon, exactly."
"Academically, he's probably at the top of my classes."
"I have the whole gammut, you know."
"I have real low level, acting out kids."
I think I can be a better man.
"Young Master, have you fallen in love with me?"
"Well, I mean..."
"You did all this today, ... and I'm a bit dumb about stuff like that."
Really?
"If you've realized that you're too dumb to realize something like this,"
I must have...
Think about it carefully.
So am I too dumb to realize it or not?
What did he mean by that?
Chang Hui.
So his name was Chang Hui!
She may not be worthy enough to marry into Yongmun.
Lady!
Lady!
My Yi Nok... my Yi Nok...!
She must have been a noblewoman from a great family.
"I hid the truth because I worried about the danger, but now I think I should find her real name."
"If I find her real name, will we find her enemy as well?"
"We found an explosives dealer, but he died before he could be questioned."
"A noble prince of royal blood, and a criminal who sells women to China..."
How could they make a deal together?
"If he wants to do something in secret, he will have no choice but to deal with men like him."
He is spraying filthy blood in order to dethrone me!
"The child of a queen of noble blood, ...or a child of a filthy palace maid..."
We both act exactly the same!
"Your Majesty, you must listen to the woes of the people before the prince appears."
You must bring them to your side!
"If you continue to neglect your duties and dally in women and alcohol, the people's anger towards you will turn into a welcome for the prince."
People can be so stupid!
The prince is a monster just like me!
Why do they want him?
-I've never driven one of these
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-She's a M.I.L.F.
-get back in you cage!
-I'm gonna change your grade kiddo
"-Justin,that's not even funny -asshole"

My name is Autumn Moon.
I quit school after junior high.
I was no good in my study.
But the education system was no better.
It not only excludes me from further study... ...but produces juveniles like me.
"I've got nothing to do but hang around public playgrounds... ...playing basketball, talking part in brawls... being recruited as or recruiting triad members."
Stop!
No way!
Can I have a shoot?
This half-witted jerk is Sylvester.
I never found out his last name.
But I'm sure he's no Stallone.
"I ""recruited"" him from the street."
He was being bullied by a group of students and I came to help him.
"Well, at least he was smart enough now... ...that I could provide protection for him."
"That's how he became my ""junior""."
One brags about being a Big Brother. ...but one doesn't boast oneself of having a retard like sylvester as junior.
If anyone of you will never bully him again... ...I'll make sure you pay for it.
"Well, you may think I'm worth nothing because"
I'm jobless and hang around all day... ...but that's not exactly true.
My job is to help Big Brother Wing collect debts.
"I'm lone wolf type of person, doing whatever I like to do."
"To me, freedom counts first."
I'm not like the rest of them because I have brains.
I don't take orders.
And YU is just answering =)

So two years ago today
"February 11, 2006 my partner, Juan Montealegre died in Miami"
"For those who were listening to Yeast Radio at the time will recall the entire ordeal and the memorial service is on Yeast Radio in complete unedited form if you go to somewhere around February 15th or 14th, 2006 the funeral was on February 14th, 2006"
"I want to show you something, though which is the point of this video"
"This is Juan's death certificate now I've crossed out the parts that I don't want to show because they are, you know, irrelevant, relatives, Social Security, that kind of thing and I've highlighted things I want to show you"
"Now, keep in mind that first of all, if you've listened to Yeast Radio you'll know that I was"
Juan's sole caretaker when he was sick and I had to deal care of all matters of significance and I was his partner and we were planning to come here to Chicago on Feburary 1st 2006 and he died shortly after that
"Needless to say, he was unable to come up here"
I say that just as evidence of our partnership together.
Plus we had already had a business - started a business together - a hair salon
So here is what I want to show you.
They said he was a geek.
"Some kids had told him he was worthless, to go hang himself, and I think he got to the point where enough was enough."
"Tonight, a tragic situation."
"A Perkins boy, just 11 years ago, believed to have been desperate enough to take his own life."
This is an awfully complicated and difficult issue.
"Kids will be kids, boys will be boys."
They are just cruel at this age.
"Here what we get is, nothing's wrong, we didn't do anything, everything's fine."
"They punch me, strangle me, take things from me, sit on me."
Give it to him hard.
He is not safe on that bus.
I have been on that bus.
They are just as good as gold.
My voice is not going to fall silent.
I will go to my grave until a difference is made.
"We reached out to parents who have lost kids, parents of kids that are being bullied all over the world, and it took off like wildfire."
All it takes is for one person to stand up.
Be the difference.
"Go out and find that one child, that new kid standing over there by himself."
Be willing to stand up for him.
Everything starts with one and builds up.
"Eventually, we have an army."
"If we all do it together, we will change the world."

*I saw your eyes today in court when* *I explained the significance of 3 a. m.*
*It's not going to stop* *until Emily's story is told. *
Are you gonna make a statement?
Do you believe it was the devil?
Is the defense ready to proceed?
"Yes, Your Honor."
The defense recalls Father Richard Moore.
The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.
"Her mother, Maria, called me and said that Emily had asked for me."
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.
Did Emily explain to you the letter's significance?
Yes.
She said she'd written it the morning after the failed exorcism... ...and that it was important for me to share.
"Father Moore, was Emily a good person?"
I believe that one day Emily will be recognized as a saint.
- So she loved God.
- Yes.
She was very devout.
"Father Moore, if Emily loved God... ...if she was so good and so devout, why do you think God... ...allowed this to happen?"
- Objection.
What is the relevance of that question?
Father Moore's belief in this matter is crucial... ...in establishing his and Emily's understanding of her condition.
"And that mutual understanding is paramount in determining... ...whether Father Moore was, in fact, negligent."
I'm going to allow it.
"Your Honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify... ...about why God would allow the death of a young girl?"
The objection has been overruled.
"Again, Father Moore:"
Why did God allow Emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
"Witnesses claim that Daylan Rizastabbed Nazif Karu for revenge,"
They are old enemies! objection
These are pure speculationwithout any evidenceto turned the case in other direction!
"We have all the evidence and witnesses all registeredin the dossier,Mrs.."
Judge!
That's allof revenge between rival gangs!
Daylan Rizastabbed Nazif Kara and he just wantsUse misfortune to their advantageand get our sympathy...
"Daylan is my old friend...I would never hurt me! clear recognition that they are friends,He is a friend of a gangster boss with criminal convictions... please addthat on the record..."
Call the first witnessMahir Karu!
Mahir Kara!
Witnesses did not come!

"I'm sorry,Mrs.."
Judge they refused me earlier to let me out of the hospital... but I'm here...
"My dear friends,"
"Ibo betrayed usand tried to kill me,I do not know why..."
"Find him .. where, I do not know..."
I do not even knowhow do you bring it here
Just bring him.
"In what way,I do not know,"
Bring itand dead if necessary.
Do you understand me?
"Come on now,see you."
It's Salih Ipek!...How is this possible?
How is this possible?
Enough!Order in the court!

Bay and the beach with the map and if we'd find something we'd just mark it.
"Because they're trying to get a drift pattern to the bodies, or survivors."
Then we'd come back and drop it off
But all those guys - the bodies that came in were all in the fetal position
And two guys survived.
One guy lived between
Charlevoix and [?].
Dad knew him quite well.
He said they started off with more than that on the raft a floating type thing.
"But it was so bad a night - just a nasty night, as you can imagine."
And the water felt warm to them.
Which it would
The water was 35 degrees and the air was 15 with sleet.
"They said, ""I'm just going to get in here and get warm."""
And they drifted away.
Two of them did hang on.
"Survived, out of the -"
But we could hear when they were breaking out -
"You listen at night, to the transitions on the channels."
Can you hear the radio of The Bradley before they went down?
Uh-huh.
Radioed in.
"It's breaking away, or bending away or"
"And when you flew out with - who was the pilot, again, that you flew out with?"
Don Hanson
"When you flew out, the goal of that flight was what?"
Flew all of the islands.
All around the shores of all the islands.
To look for survivors?
For survivors or anything that would be anything.
"And I was 16, 17 at the time."
Did you know at that time where the location of where The Bradley was?
Turn in a circle and clap!
Yay!

"this poem is called ""the lovers"" who see them going in the city if everyone is blind."
They take eachother by the hand.
Something speaks inbetween theire fingers
"In this video, we're going to look at a proof that the perceptron learning procedure will eventually get the weights into the cone of feasible solutions."
I don't want you to get the wrong idea about the course from this video.
"In general, it's going to be about engineering, not about proofs of things."
There'll be very few proofs in the course.
But we get to understand quite a lot more about perceptrons when we try and prove that they will eventually get the right answer.
So we get to use our geometric understanding of what's happening in weight space as to get a proof that the perceptron will eventually find a weight vector.
Okay.
There are forces surrounding this trial.
"Dark, powerful forces."
"Just be careful, Erin."
Watch your step.
I see.
Look...
"Father, you don't have to worry about me."
"I'm an agnostic, remember?"
"Demons exist, whether you believe in them or not."
Your involvement in this trial might just open you up to their attacks.
"Look, Father, I appreciate your concern... ...but you need to be worried about yourself."
"Ethan Thomas is using the medical aspects of this case as ammunition... ...and I have to be prepared for his attacks, so... ...with what little time we have, I think we need to focus on your defense."
"Now, what I need from you is more information about Emily's condition."
Specific details of how it progressed after the dorm-room episode.
"Well, after the first incident... ...she was sent to the university hospital for testing and observation."
"Emily once told me that in her dorm room, she resisted the demons... ...but at the hospital they overcame her."
So she believed... ...that her possession began at the hospital?
"Yeah, I think she did."
"And after that, things just went from bad to worse."
Emily!
Emily?
"Oh, my God."
Emily?
Don't touch me.
"Jason, please... ...don't leave me."
*And I never did leave her. *
*I stayed until the end. *
So much of what we shared was like a nightmare... ...but I wouldn't give up a single minute I spent with her.
"She woke me up, you know?"
"To things I never felt before, things I never knew I could feel."
I never knew how dead I was until I met her.
How are things?
My dad is not back yet...
"We don't know his where about- Oh,really?"
"He sent a message, only to me."
"""I am out of the city, I have to clear my head a bit, don't worry and so on"" - he wrote.."
So much.
"- Good thing,that he informed you.."
I have a terrible headache.
"If you want we can stop in a ""Pharmacy"", before you get the forest street."
"No, i already took some medicines, i have always these migraines..."
If I have the pain I can't open my eyes.
Now of course got worse...-Then we turn off the air conditioner and open the widows..
The air comes in.
Open your side too.
"If there was a little support for Faruk, if there was a source to handle his assets for some months,"
I know he will pull himself together.
There are some things he is waiting for but...
"Don't cry my dear, don't cry.."
Everything went so wrong...
The only thing I can't endure in this life is woman's tears.
"Don't do it, please."
"For sure, there must be a way to save us from this situation.."
The only way is to pay the debts...
Unfortunately..
The wares can't compensate the debt.. then everything will be sold... whoever buys it.
"Ender also will have to wait fairly to get her debt back, I know this."
What has Ender to do with it?
You did not know?
Faruk borrowed money from Ender too.
Exactly 500.000 US dollars.
"Leave it for Gods sake, this is all humbug (palaver)..."
I wonder why are you so cruel when it comes to Faruk?
Thank you so much for your concern.
"It seems like you're doing some secret work, but I hope you're safe too."
"He was a bit strange, but he was a good man."
How can you tell?
"I'm not sure, but he smelled really nice."
"If you thought he smelled nice, then he must have eaten chicken or dumplings."
It wasn't like that!
It was a nicer smell than dumplings!
"It smelled like ""I love you""!"
Then maybe he ate both chicken and dumplings!
"Anyway, I feel like I met a really nice person today."
So you met a mysterious man in a black hat under the moonlight...?
Then maybe his name is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
Sir Moonlight Back Hat?
That's awesome!
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
So you're saying that ship and warehouse both belong to Yongmun?
Yes.
I'm sure they moved all the girls to the ship by now.
"If they both belong to Yongmun, then did they just loan them to the loan sharks?"
"If they loaned it out to a dirty man, then they must have had dirty business."
What should we do if Yongmun responds?
"If Yongmun comes forward, then we should too."
We may have a fight on our hands.
But...
I don't think they will.
That is the explosives manufactured by Choi Chul Joo.
They are more powerful than the explosives from China.
"If this deal with him succeeds, then will we have unlimited access to these explosives?"
Yes.
"If we add the power of those explosives to our army and weapons, we will not be lacking in the next attempt."
Is there a way we can obtain those explosives without Choi Chul Joo?
I don't want to return to the beginning again now.
Come on!
I had very difficult childhood.
there were so many things i did not have in my life.
"I didn't know about the comfort of a bed at all... a warm house, sleeping with a full stomach , to dream of beautiful things..."
But now i know..
"When one is in poverty it doesn't impose so much, because there is nothing, , nothing!"
One is subzero...
"But now is difficult,Mira."
I don't want to lose these.
At least that will not happen...
"When we met with Faruk, he loved an ignorant but beautiful girl."
"I did everything,.. so he loved me."
"From the day I walked out of that neighborhood, I didn't return there again ,never looked back."
I wanted to forget..
"And, I did forget."
"I wanted Asude to be Sude,"
And it happened like that...
"I know the value of my life better ,than any other women , who lives this kind of life.."
That i don't want to lose ..
Do you understand?
"I don't want my children to live in bad conditions , which i had as kid.."
I don't want you to worry about your future.
So you won't have to climb through life..
"Mom, please!"
"Don't write tragedy scenarios right away, for God's sake"
Nothing will be as you think.
"Above all, i trust my dad."
You trust the man who licked the dust in front of everyone.?
"Don't do it, for Gods sake."
"Okay, i mean i also will not forget what happened this evening."
"but I am not in love with this sort of life, as much as you are."
"Feride ,If you can stayand give you support."
"No need for that ,Turgut ."
I Will do the in your caseMrs.
Judge?
What a fate !
"Mr. Erda , please the defendant should not speakwithout permission!"
Let's start with the procedure .
With your permission .
Do you want to say somethingin defense of your client ?
Ma'am .
"Judge , defendantaddress is known ."
"Accepts all chargesand admits that he forged official documentsand is fully prepared accessed all hearings,for that matter please defendant Mahir Kara wos brought to trial,but not in a prison."
"Mr. Erdal against the accused Mahir Kare was not only raised the accusation for false identity you will judge him, because of fraud too."
He was also chargedthat is included in the job of weapons smuggling .
Mr. Mahir stoletruck full of bullets!
But I ..
Mr. Mahir !were you that nighton the scene?
Mrs. Judge did read fileI gave you .
Prosecutor Turgut was trying to set me upand cover up his dirty work .
"If you continue with these accusations ,I will raise charges against youfor false accusations and humiliation of the Court"
and you will have to dealthe third case.
Is there any eyewitnesseswho sawthe scene that night ?
"Then someone accused Bulent Tyrjaki ,Your brother in law , and a case full of bulletswas found in his shop ."
It's a trap !
"And you can have a dossierand your brother in law too ,filled with charge!"
"All fabricated lies, ma'am."
Judge !
"We reject all allegationsand declare that we are not guilty ,Mrs. Judge ."
I thought you came to meand said that you werethere that night ? is that correct ?
Have you beenon the sceneor not ?
"Yeah , I was , but .."
I wasfor a good cause .
What is the solution of negative two-fifths X equals ten?
"Once again we have to keep equality, so we're going to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation."
"So, we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of negative two-fifths, which is negative five-halves."
"Remember, when I multiply  negative five-halves times negative two-fifths, those numbers don't cancel out, they become one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to negative fifty-halves, or X is equal to negative twenty-five."
"This looks like it's the solution for our equation, but we're not going to be positive until we check it."
"So, negative two-fifths X equals ten."
I'm going to substitute negative twenty five in for X and I get fifty over five equals ten.
"So, ten equals ten."
That makes negative twenty five the solution for this equation.
In this lesson you have learned that you can solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
"I'm going to be asking you a few questions, ok?"
Some of them may seem quite silly.
"Bear with me, alright?"
"First of all, we need to find out, do you know what day it is?"
What day of the week is it?
TUESDAY.
Tuesday.
What's the date?
"It's the 21 of July, 2009."
Fantastic.
And what season does that put us in?
SUMMER.
Summer.
OK.
Where are we now?
"FlRST FLOOR, IN PRlNCESS ROYAL."
And what city are we in?
KENT.
And what country are we in?
ENGLAND.
I'm going to ask you to remember 3 objects.
You're...
Moonlight Warrior!
Moonlight Warrior?
Wow.
That's not bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'll be a warrior fighting against evil men like Sir Moonlight Black Hat!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I will not forgive you in the name of justice!
Moonlight Warrior!
Why don't you finish your bowl of rice in the name of hunger?
Alright.
"Rice, I will finish you off in an instant!"
"Soup, you're with him!"
I'll destroy the both of you!
You are a true glutton of Joseon!
"When I see him next, I will definitely get his name."
"Your life is now at its lowest since you sold off your daughters. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you are to lift yourself up from there, you must invoke your sense of pride!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"If you really don't think you can make a difference, then you should just die!"
"If you're going to keep on living, then you must fight!"
I have been there and picked myself up.
He is right.
Let us pick ourselves from the pit and rise up together!
I forsook my own daughter and considered myself no less than an animal!
Thank you for helping us do something!
We'll do everything from this point on.
This is the promissory note that Choi Chul Joo wrote for me.
One day's interest is ten thousand yang.
"In ten days, he will owe a hundred thousand yang."
We will use his interest money and use it to buy back your daughters!
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!
He will try and set sail as soon as possible to minimize the interest payments.
Do whatever it takes to stop that ship.
Security is high.
"And they—that is, the Middlesex County Correctional Department were forced to place her in a women's facility."
But that was a horrible situation amounting to torture.
AG:
"Your case went to the Supreme Court, how you were treated in the court?"
LH:
"Well, there's the illusion—you know, I wrote a book called illusions of Justice."
There is the illusion that we have justice in the United States.
"I made the mistake of thinking that lawyers enjoyed a First Amendment right, and I called a press conference, and I criticized the trial judge at the trial and said that the case was a legalized lynching."
"And before you know it, I was facing disbarment."
They attempted to disbar me by bringing charges against me.
And they asked me to come and explain myself.
I refused.
I sued the judge.
I sued the prosecutor.
"And I sued all of the members of the Ethics Committee, forced them to come to my office."
I took their depositions.
And the case went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.
"United States Supreme Court said,"
"""Well, Hinds could not have understood the seriousness of the charges; otherwise, he would not have made that sort of statement."""
They sent the case back to New Jersey.
The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed and tossed it out.
AG:
"You're still a lawyer today, and you—"
LH:
I'm still a lawyer today.

And you represented South African President Nelson Mandela?
LH:
"That's correct, yeah."

Come on.
What about the picture Mike?
"Simply misunderstanding, media distortion###."
Tabloid sensationalism.
I don't know Mike.
I saw the mayor this morning and he didn't look like a man that had spent the night alone
I'm happy to report that he's alone and unloved
"Alright, let's move on to something little lighter"
"Hey Paul, how's your headwound"
Hank's still suing### you Paul?

The last thing I need is publicity* about one city hall employee suing another one

Here it is
My family's thanks giving recipe for the best sweet potato pie in the world
Guard it with your life.####
This is a xeroxed page from the Joy of cooking
That book has been in my family for years
I can't wait to go home for thanks giving.
I love the whole thing.
A little snow on the ground a little touch football game before dinner.
Get to sit at the kiddie table.
You still sit at the kiddy table?
"Big fish, small pond"
Thanks giving at my house is nothing but a bunch of fat overstuffed### drunk sitting in front of a TV turned### up so loud they can't hear each other
"Oh, and me in the bedroom rifling** through jacket"
"So, that's 5 days and 4 nights at the Bahama Hilton? is the continental breakfast included in that?"
Thank you
Your family's going to The Bahamas for Thanksgiving?
I hope not.
I graduated from high school and went to college and business school.
"So, you know, it's important to get ahead in life."
"Sarah Lee keeps up the family tradition by attending the children's storefront school in Harlem, where at first she is a standout student."
"And to everybody who knows her, Sarah Lee is a leader, highly motivated, and highly verbal."
She can really hold a conversation.
She will talk to you.
"You say, alright,"
Sarah just a minute.
Just take a break for a minute.
"Go get you something to drink or get a fruit or something, just to hush her up for just a few minutes."
"[INAUDlBLE] been in the store, right?"
Yeah.
For a long time.
Told you.
"Feelin' it, feelin' it."
But in the fourth grade something changes.
She got real shy in history.
She wouldn't participate in classroom activities in history class.
She wouldn't come with the answers.
She would do her homework but it would take her a little longer.
So she got tired of being slower in the work.
"And she kept saying, mom, something is not right."
"Like, I couldn't understand."
My comprehension wasn't well.
And my vocabulary wasn't well.
And my reading skills wasn't well.
Her teacher also notices a puzzling difference between Sarah Lee's personality in class and out.
By nature she's very energetic and outgoing socially.
"But in class, a lot of time, it's the opposite."
She'll listen and she's not a behaviour issue.
And she'll sort of look at you and focus right at you.
"But I always wonder, you know, how much she's really absorbing."
Yes it is.
"And what is exciting about it is, because this grant involves students and research, the students get to be involved in, sort of, cutting-edge research."
No other institution in the country is looking at pennycress.
Or looking at this sort of approach at off-season seed production.
And so part of my job is to breed new varieties of pennycress.
And the big part of that is trying to produce more oil on these seeds.
"They are about 36 percent, right at the moment."
"And we're trying to get that, up to say, 40 to 45 percent."
And so a big part of this trying to look into these seeds and finding out how much oil is in there.
Beth Seaton:
How do you do that?
Win Phippen:
"Well, we've hired a chemist, and we have, it's called an ""automated GC"" or a gas chromatograph."
And it allows us to look inside these seeds to find out how much oil is in them.
"I actually have one next door, if you want to go over and take a look."
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, let's take a look."
Win Phippen:
All right.
Beth Seaton:
Let's go.
Win Phippen:
So come on in.
This is the research lab.
And this is where we actually extract the oil right out of the seeds.
"Another grant that I wrote with the USDA allowed us purchase an automated gas chromatograph, and that allows us to actually look at the oils inside in the seed."
And so the first thing we have to do is we have to actually count these seeds.
Beth Seaton:
"So you count these little, tiny seeds?"
Win Phippen:
These tiny little seeds.
Beth Seaton:
He was just as light on his feet as - you couldn't imagine a guy that size could be as light on his feet in step dance.
"The Donie guys, of course, Peter and Patsy, they used to always..."
"Patsy, Peter, and..."
Patsy worked for me.
Best worker I had.
But Peter and
Lester would - They'd get up...
Friendly rivalry.
Which was good.
"Could you describe a typical party at night or something, where they'd be playing music?"
"Yeah, they'd play the music."
They had the chairs sitting around the hall.
The parish hall?
"Wouldn't have any tables set up unless it was a dinner or a wedding, you know."
"So here you are, you're trying to dance and you've got everybody in the aisle and all these old women standing there watching you."
So you're not really doing too much dancing.
"Jack [?] would set up a stable right outside there, right around the corner where they..."
They'd have a keg of beer out there.
"Because it wasn't - the bar wasn't in the - in fact, the kitchen was where the bar is now."
And where the kitchen is was the high school.
That's what they...
There at the parish hall?
Yeah.
"And then when they finally quit using that, they made that into a little library too."
In 1960.
Even when they first put the other stuff out.
They wouldn't have any alcohol in the parish hall.
They'd have the keg sitting on a table outside.
"Yeah, just a table thing there."
And then - so continue with that scene.
"Well, that'd be it."
And they'd just play the music.
"Unfortunately, Al Gore was busy but I did manage to speak to some other people who had quite a bit to say on the subject."
You look great.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Some information.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hi.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you finally.
- Yeah.
You do such great work. - Thank you.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
What are you doing here at the moment?
"We're out here trying to show people that if they're eating meat, they're engaging in the number one environmentally most destructive behaviour they could engage in."
"And showing people that rather than cars and trucks, and SUVs even, rather than planes, meat is the number one cause of global warming."
Do people believe that when you tell them?
People are shocked to find out.
"We hear so much about cars, and trains and planes and energy, and people don't realise that it is actually the meat on their plate that's causing global warming rather than the car that they're driving even."
Some information here.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
How's it going?
Check that out when you have a chance.
Thank you.
Check that out.
Thank you.
"We use this catchy phrase ""cli-meat change""."
Its really just a way of to grab attention and get people to look in our direction long enough for us to give them a leaflet and explain the issue a little bit further.
OK.
"And get them to go home wondering how is it that meat causes global warming, rather than wondering what's on television tonight, or what am I going to have for dinner tonight."
TOM BEARDEN:
Do you ever get mad about this?
DANlEL BELL:
It gets frustrating.
It definitely does.
TOM BEARDEN:
"Bell says the ranch has become a much more dangerous place, too."
Do you fear for your life out here?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, when we're out in places like this, where we don't have communications, and you're always thinking, what am I going to do if something happens?"
TOM BEARDEN:
Have you ever come across armed people coming across the border?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, I have, on several occasions."
And the most recent one was actually when we were building this fence.
"We were hauling material in with a mule and we came around on a trail that's used by smugglers, and ran right into a group of about 10 people."
I have two daughters now.
That's Ida and her baby sister Rosa.
And to the junk food industry I say this: my children - all of our children - are none of your business.

Thank you.

largest student-run event in the country.
And so the students take full advantage of those opportunities.
The learn a lot from it also.
Beth Seaton:
"You have a lot of international type of things going on in the department also, don't you?"
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
"For many of our students, they have not had the opportunity to go overseas."
"Some of them, frankly, have not even been to Chicago or on an airplane."
But we take them and have taken them to China.
"Last year, was to Australia."
We have a trip to Brazil coming up.
"A trip to Russia, which was very successful."
"And the students understand that it opens up a whole new world for them, which they were not aware of before."
Beth Seaton:
I remember reading in the newspaper about the trip you took to Australia.
You were on that trip.
William Bailey:
Yes.
Beth Seaton:
I was surprised at how many students you were able to take with you.
William Bailey:
"It's always a concern, because the students pay for it themselves."
"We keep the cost as low as possible but at the end of the day, it is a wonderful experience, and the students uniformly get their moneys' worth."
And we have many students who will go on every trip we offer.
Beth Seaton:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today about some of the things going on in the School of
Agriculture at WlU.
William Bailey:
"Thank you very much for dropping by, Beth."
We enjoy sharing all of our activities with you.
Beth Seaton:

-So where's the ghost?

Now we are going to look at the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and it's role on heart health.
The Mediterranean diet has certainly been around for millennium and yet there is no one Mediterranean diet.
"It refers in general to the way the people in the countries of the Mediterranean diet, have traditionally eaten foods."
"There's a hypothesis that there are differences among these populations, for whatever reason."
The way that these populations have eaten for centuries has actually lead to lower rates of heart disease that you might see in other parts of the world.
So the first person to really study this relationship and to scientifically prove that eating a certain way impacted your heart health was an individual known as Dr. Ancel Keys.
Dr. Ancel Keys lived to be 100 years old from 1904 to 2004.
"It's good, but not great."
People say things that aren't true.
- It's never true...
- But they can make it bigger.
The following day...
They demand:
"""You who have knowledge, power and money"""
"""you must give all children a fighting chance!"""
"They fall down, stare into space and think:"
"""It will just get worse for the children."""
But raise your eyes and you'll see the statistics.
That's the world up there.
The world in 1959.
The ring corresponds to the bubble.
In London I lectured to hedge fund managers.
They're the worst kind of capitalists.
They wanted to know the exact condi- tions in every West African country.
"They know if there is sun, ore, oil, forest..."
They invest in Africa and want to know what country is most stable.
But the aid organizations have the same policy for everyone.
"The organization has an environmental, school or gender policy."
Then they pursue it in all countries.
To me it was horrific that businesspeople had a more fact-based worldview than young activists and university professors.
Dad was a coffee roaster at Lindvalls Coffee.
"Here, look..."
This is great...
"In this cigar box I have Dad's old club badge and five cents from East Africa, a coin Dad found in the coffee bags."
The raw coffee beans pass under magnets so all metal is removed.
They bring in huge amounts and inspect them carefully.
Here are coins from Colombia and Guatemala...
"Dad brought the coins home, sat me in his lap and got out the atlas."
He told me that the Africans didn't own their coffee plantations.
I'll say it today before it's too late.
I've saved a woman from afire...
Saved a man from drowning...
"But now,"
Now...
I want to save a man who's fallen in love.
"I know it's too late, but..."

The stadium will be open for use from 9am to 10pm.
The district will try to attract
Citizens from various classes.
Now some late-breaking news.
"This evening, a fire broke out in a shoe factory in Dobong-gu."
"The blaze killed two firemen on duty... and a third, unidentified victim."
The firemen killed were 40-year old Suh Ki-soo and 30-year old Lee Jin-woo.
38-year old Lee Jo-hyung was severely burned and moved to a hospital.
The tragedy occurred in the basement of the building as the dispatched firemen tried to extinguish the flames.
"Finally, Hong will report on tonight's weather."
Rain is falling across the nation.
"The rain should quell the 20-day heat wave and open the rainy season, according to the Weather Bureau."
The early arrival of the monsoon... will most likely continue for a month.
"Especially starting the next month, a seasonal rain front will..."
Please draw me again.
"Actually, I'm leaving to study abroad next month."
"I know, you punk."
That's why I'm showing it to you.
I don't show this to just anyone.
There was something I really wanted to draw before leaving.
"If the chance came, I thought I could draw it well."
I really thought... that I could draw it well.
I know it already.
"You wanted to draw me, but it didn't turn out as you expected."
"""And what does 32 and a half - that number - mean to you?"""
Rachel:

Clare is one kilo heavier.

Their mum:
"""I'd picked up a diary that was open in their room and read it."
"They'd read about anorexia and they had stopped eating."""
"Their dad: ""... and were noticed."" Mum:""Yeah, that was their way of being noticed at school."""
"""When we got anorexia, it was the first time we got recognized."""
"""People actually verbally said to us, 'Oh gee, you lost weight' and we thought hey, this is an achievement."""
"When Rachel and Claire look in the mirror, they don't see what we see."
"""Your face is thinner."" ""No way, you are so much thinner."""
They see a distorted image of themselves and of each other.
"Anorexia is not just about being thin, it's a serious mental illness."
"""I think you take away the anorexia and then my God, I have nothing."
I don't even know who I am.
"We've lost ourselves but we've never found ourselves in the first place"""

It was when Golgotha killed Dardane.
"And surprise surprise, the very same day you find an item that is not even referenced in the loots's list of Horizon 1.1."
"Comrades, this is a critical moment, an emergency meeting is a must."
"Come on, follow me... and you, come here."
Okay I see.
I need to contact Tenshirock as soon as possible.
What is the date...
Tenshirock.
"Tenshirock, Tenshirock !"
- I absolutely needed to see you.
"- Really, what for ?"
This.
Well !
If it isn't my favorite little noob.
"Can you tell me why you give him a cheated item while me, your old friend for ages, I get nothing."
"Ash, Ash, Ash."
We are not going to talk about this again.
"I already explained my motives to you : if I give you just one item, created by me, you're going to resale it right away to those poor souls who are enchained in their virtual world."
And you'll feed their addiction.
"Me, I'm here to set them free."
There is no such thing as a worthless trade... and you didn't answer my question.
Noob power.
What?
"Noob power, it is nothing else than my brilliant plan to decolonise the MMORPG."
I already regret asking...
And how do you plan to handle it this time ?
"Well, as usual, a small demonstration is better than a long speech, look."
"Comrades, this item is a threat to the Noob guild."
We are near the destruction.
"If one of the game master sees us with it, nobody will escape."
And our avatars will be deleted.
This staff is a gift... a gift to the foes of the Noob guild.
You don't see me in the hood
It's cause I'm doing this man

It's not easy.
It's hard changing your life !
"That in the process working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain, a lot of set backs and a lot of defeats."
"At moments when you ""re going to doubt yourself and say:"
"""God why is this happening to me,"
"I'm just trying to take care of my children, my mother."
I'm not trying to steal or rob from anybody.
How does this have to happen to me?
"For those of you all that have experienced some hardships, don't give up on your dream."
Pain is temporary.
"It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year,"
but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.
"If I quit, however, it lasts forever."
Talent you have naturally.
Skill is only developed by hours and hours... ...and hours of beating on your craft.
"I will not go down, THAT WAY!"
"it's about no days off no weekends, no holidays, no birthdays."
Listen to me!
No days off!
No half days!
No holidays!
No snow day!

It's about separation.
It's about separating yourself from the past !

You will take three exams.
"The first is ""General culture"" and you will definitely make it."
"You will have to study for the second one, if it's necessary I will help you, but you already have high grades."
"Are you in ""good level"" for mathematics?"
"Wow, his favorite!"
You will rock!
"Only language is left, you will study a bit for it too.. or if you really want it you will manage it too."
"But forget about it, I think you should study,"
language is always important anyways.
What happened with his mouth today?
I have to occupy my brain or I will swear very badly.
Why?- Forget about it!
It's like that!
The interviewing can be a little hard.
"You shouldn't be excited, but you are cool anyway, you won't be excited."
"But again they will deal with you, it"" obvious."

Asim Sekip Kaya University won't give you that scholarship so easily...
"Let me tell you, first Asim Sekip Kaya won't give it to you..."
He won't ever in this life show favor to you.He won't ever in this life show favor to you.
Furthermore he will deal with you.
Don't think it's so easyyyy!!!
You pass this two exams like a lion... after that even if you *** in their mouths during the interview again nothing will happen!
Mert!
Are you doing it intentionally?
"Mom, don't mess with me today!"
It's like that.
"I mean, I don't have any doubt that the Coupe is a little bit better."

This car is barely a convertible.
The roof aperture is so small it's more of a targa really.
And it's quite a fussy shape from some angels.
Those rear buttresses rise unexpectedly high.
And those ultra-low profile tires leave annoying amounts of vacant space in the wheel arches.
"And this particular example has 63,000 pounds of extras on top of the 200 grand list price."
"The titanium wheel bolts are 1,900 pounds."
[CAR ENGlNE]
"But it's just, it's a very, very exciting car."
"It's very obedient, the steering's fast."
The controls lack quite a lot of feedback.
But it's really interesting how quickly you can kind of adjust your inputs to the speed that they require.

I didn't have the time.
"Because remember, I was too busy driving the 458 Spider"
like I was in some sort of computer game.
"But in doing so, I can now tell you that it's an absurdly good car to drive."
"You can chuck it around like a cheap rally car, and that shouldn't really be possible."
Of course I could never buy a convertible Ferrari for all the obvious reasons.
But I could just about forgive anyone who bought one of these.

"The seasons, they're all awesome."
"It's a big University, but they still give you a sense of community."
Small but big at the same time.
You feel connected to all the students.
It has a small feel in a big place.
Hands down the best school.
Any interests that you have can be accommodated somewhere.
What I like about U.R.I. is they have alot of clubs that are specific to your major.
We have over a hundred different clubs here.
Making alot of good friends is fun.
"If there's something specific you want to do, you can probably find another group of active people who want to do the same thing as you."
"If you're looking for something, you can find it."
"Whether it's community service based, or maybe you want to be on student senate, or news paper, the year book."
The Ryan Center is a pretty awesome facility.
The concerts are getting alot better around here.
"I have alot of friends in the student entertainment committee, so I always get really good seats."
"I love my job, I work on campus."
"Over here, we have all of our U.R.I. merchandise."
"Sweatshirts, sweatpants, tshirts, beach towels for the beach."
You can go to the beach.
The closest one is probably
Narragansett.
Boston and New York are really close to U.R.I..
Newport's not far if you wanna go.
"This semester, I've been to the gym every week day."
Gym hours are very flexible.
"Everyone gets together, they do what they have to do."
Because that's where I am going to be
"So, you are not gonna spend Thanksgiving with your parents?"
The only mama I want to see is the bahama mama
What is this....some kind of fruity club med###?
"Actually, it's a very secluded part of the island"
"Nothing but palm tree, warm sand, me, three books and my towel"
I have a towel.
I could get a book
"No.... you're all singing, but you're not going. you think you're traveling with me on my vacation,but that ain't happening, so you can stop singing"
I'm sure you're feeling uncomfortable
"Sir, with all due respect, sitting on a red hot poker is uncomfortable."
This is excruciating.
Maybe we should just put it on the## backburner for a while
I was kinda hoping you could explain that picture.
"Well, I was asking for change."
How was I supposed to know he was a prostitute
"So, what does### she look like to you"
She reminds me of that woman Stuart brought to the governor balls
"Thankk goodness, we can explain this whole situation"
I think I can handle it without bring my mother into it.
I was wanting to save subjecting her sex life to the scrutiny of the new York press for her Christmas visit.**
"Oh, she's coming for Christmas?"
"Sir, if you don't mind."
My mother is in there. i was kinda hoping we'd### have a little mother-son bonding
Can I at least say hi?
I think you have your quality time
"Honey, I'm so unbelievably sorry"
Just a minute
Still bonding sir
Good morning
"Mommy , it's fake happy Mike.."
You're angry.
It's easy to make a family
"But what's important is, how this family will be you have to make great effort to keep it together"
Now you'll be both responsible for each other
I am sure you will do great
But you will also face some storms you'll have fights.. discussions.. all this might happen
But it is important to know how make up you have to yield for each other try to be silent when angry
If you do these things your ship will sail
If you don't we will always remember your words
Don't worry we will do our best to keep our family happy
God willing excuse me
For many years there was only one truth.
A good quality product

. And that's still not the end of the story.
"We're gonna look at one more really interesting al-, algorithm that has, lots of important applications, called a Rabin Karp Algorithm."
Invented by two Turing award winners.
Michael Rabin and Dick Karp.
"I can remember hearing about this algorithm, from my friend, Dick Lipton, who explained it to me over the phone, and, I, he explained it to me in about, fifteen seconds, and I realized I had to have this, in the book."
"And, so now, here we are, presenting it."
"Th, that was, in the 70's."
"So the basic idea for the Rabin-Karp algorithm is, has to do with hashing."
He was a wise professor of sociology from Michigan.
"A ""Mandela"" type."
There were only eight of us at the meeting.
Afterwards he asked what we were studying and when we'd be done.
I said I would finish med school in 1975.
"""We'll probably be independent then, come work for us."" We shook on it."
Then he was killed by a letter bomb the next year.
That made the promise more serious.
In 1975 Mozambique won its independence.
"We founded the Africa Groups' Recruitment Organization and then we went, Agneta as a midwife and me as a doctor."
This is the hospital staff outside the hospital.
"White coats are professionally trained, the others were assistants."
A fair amount of them were illiterate.
Papa Enrique is wearing my glasses.
He dressed wounds.
I saw that he treated infected wounds and burns the same way.
"""Can't you see the difference?"""
I asked.
Then I gave him my glasses.
"""Now I see!"" he said."
"""There's pus in this wound."
"I can't afford glasses."""
So I gave him my spare glasses.
It gave him a whole new life.
And he provided a whole new class of care.
"When I wrote instructions, he said:"
"""Unfortunately I cannot read."""
Eventually we created two symbols.
Infections were marked with a cross and he took those last.
The hardest part was understanding the depth of poverty.
We knew we couldn't give the same kind of care as in Sweden of 1970 but we didn't realize we had to go back to 1850.
Eventually we learned to treat fractures without plaster or anesthetic.
Those who kill Innocence are criminals and not human.
"(Woman) He is a Martyr, God (Allah) is all I need."
He is the best guardian.
They murdered Flowers and Pigeons and Those who kill Innocence are criminals and not human.

"Recreation, get out of Dodge for 30 days."
So were they here just during the summer?
Yeah.
Nobody was here in the winter at all.
They'd leave and everything.
"Did they interact much with the townspeople, or?"
"Oh, yeah."
They were very friendly with a lot of different people.
"They got to know - like I said, I can't remember any names now, but - they had their free time."
"They had their retreat stuff and their prayer type times and their whatever they would have, but they'd be meandering around the dock or next door."
In the evening I think they might have had a prayer time in the evening because then they'd have a habit or something like that and after their meal they'd walk to the Coast Guard station and back and then disappear.
Go back probably for prayers or something like that.
I don't know what the hell they did.
Any interesting stories about some of them - incidents or anything?
Not really.
That I can think of.
"Talk to Loretta Slaters, she would know."
Because they were right at the end of the row there.
"She would know who the ones were, I think."
She was a little more religious than me.
"And, I'm trying to think who else would have been around at that time."
Donald Cole would be familiar.
So your high school graduating group - what other things did you do with that group?
Those...
I'm not going to put it on tape.
Okay.
"No, the things -"
We set some school records.
We had them cancel -
We used to get a group... we'd go over there and...
They came here so of course we thought we'd just entertain them.
So we did.
And um.
"It sounds like the level of reference is working well for you, right now."
Yeah.
"You don't have on your website like, if you're an advanced person, or a beginner."
You don't have those kind of groupings?
We don't.
"We're working on it. , I don't know if you've seen some of those websites where they actually have kind of portals to deal with beginners and things like that."
Speakers:
Yeah.
"But you don't have it, like tailored for those kind of."
Things on the site.
Would that be helpful for you as a user?
"Yeah, I think that would be helpful for me.'Cause I am, I've been using a lot of these programs that I would not."
"I mean, some of those are really very basic beginning stuff."
"I mean, I mean, stuff, stuff will cross over, of course."
"Like, , when you have a new."
"I need product and stuff, they probably want an analysis, start to get in what those things are, and upgrade."
"But on the other things, too."
"I also like, too, that, you know, when you have those ones that show pictures of artists."
"Creative, um..."
"Oh, creative inspiration?"
Yeah.
I do like watching some of those and the artists.
"Those are very, very nice."
"It's, it's weird the way that you guys have them listed, though."
"Ah, it."
It's always hard for me to remember how to find it.
Mm-hm.
"Let's call it documentary, but this ."
Yeah.
"Navigation wise subject, like I wasn't to know that when I sort of, of , something. these guys beginning. ."
"Where, the, the, the stories."

"Our friend Charles, who works at Twitter will help us out."
Let's start with the Find People feature
located at the top of Charles's Home page on twitter.com.
The Find On Twitter section allows you to search with Usernames or real names.
Enter the name.
Hit the Search button.
"With the results, click a Username."
"From their Profile, select the Follow button to start following."
"When that person posts a Tweet, anyone who follows them will see a new Tweet in their Home page Timeline."
Name searches work well when you're looking for someone specific to follow.
But maybe you know tons of people and want this to go faster.
Let's go back to the Find People section and then to the Find Friends tab.
"From here, we'll permit Twitter to scan through Charles's contacts and show us his friends who are already using Twitter."
Here's how to do this.

"Ah, then should we try the ""yawning method?"""
Yawning method?
"So, now the word ""concluded"" is basically the same as ""to finish"" something."
"You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded."
"Now, the second sentence we're going to look at"
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.
"In this particular sentence, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yawning is somewhat contagious."
"So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Just use that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You yawn during class. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But if Seung Jo yawns after you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;then that means he has glanced over at you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If he's not interested, why would he look at you?"
Yes!!
"So, you're going to make effort to get it."
"They're both advocating a deal, it means they both really want the deal."
Is my lesson really that boring guys?
It's ruined.
I haven't suffered from anything so far.
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.
"Yeah, You and Me..."
I just lived off my greatness.
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.
What do we do??
It seems we belong together more and more.
"That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house."
Looking at her...
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.
"And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong."
It was quite surprising
So I should experience the world more...
"I think about it often, lately."
"Anyways, thank you He Ra."
That I could talk to someone about this ...
It's a relief
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-"
"Hey, Ha Ni ah!"
"How much do you have, if the interest rate is eight%?"
2.59 million.
Huge difference in magnitude and who's the culprit?
Compounding.
"In this case, the culprit is helpi ng you."
"But in the case of if you are paying it, it hurts."
"So, we'll do a loan later."
"So, here it's helping you."
"So, let's talk through this problem a little bit."
And so that you understand how empowered you are.
"How empowered actually you are and Finance will make you feel liberated in some, in the simple problem."
"So here, here you go."
"Let me ask you, who decided the 10,000?"
Think about it.
"Who should decide the 10,000 every year?"
You?
Or a financial adviser?
Who?
I hope the answer is you.
"So, 10,000 if you have, I know it's not easy to figure out."
But I would encourage you to think about what your needs are in the future so that you could figure out how much you need to put away.
"And we'll talk, do a problem quite the reverse in a second, say you put away $10,000, who decides that?"
You decide that.
"Second question, what is the other number in this problem?"
It's 40.
How many years to retirement?
"I know you can say that a job may have a retirement age or some sort of, but I, I challenge you in that."
"Hopefully, you will have much more control on when you retire."
Then you think you do.
"By that, I mean you should keep learning in"
"life so that you will always have the opportunity to do something, right?"
And we are talking about the money problem but it could be about anything.

They surely don't wash his feet.
None of the things that a great aristocrat is supposed to do when a stranger comes up on their shores.
Even lowly ones should receive this treatment.
Remember what Nausicaa said when she saw
Odysseus at the beginning of book six.
He was basically dead.
He had no clothes on.
He was totally bedraggled.
He was in that beggar situation.
Even worse off than he is right now.
At least he has rags on when he approaches his own house.
"When Nausicaa saw that uh-huh, naked and destitute Odysseus, she said even this person deserves our respect because all guest friends come from Zeus."
"So she said in book six you got to be nice even to those lowly people, rode down to the totem pole."
But the Suitors don't have any of the graciousness of this.
They don't give him hospitality.
"They're busy you know, hoarding and taking Odysseus' goods without sharing anymore themselves."
"Page 366, that comes out."
"Then Odysseus, as he, as he works his way into this group has a chance to tell his story."
We've seen him do this in the context of
Eumaeus.
"When he offers a story, Eumaeus listens to all the details and makes a connection with them."
"Not so, with the suitors."
"Odysseus goes on, talks about being a"
Cretan sailor.
They don't understand the meaning.
"They don't understand that, yeah, maybe there's a stranger here we should be nice to."
They have no fellow feeling.
No linkage with Odysseus.
368.
"That comes off, they treated him very rudely."
Contrast this with what Eumaeus does.
Eumaeus is doing the right thing.
How does that not drive you crazy?
You get used to it.
I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
He can say what he wants.
The bottom line is he's showing me off.
Dr Bension.
"Oh, just give us a second."
Will you big guy.
Did you hear about it.
Watching Dr Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
Any questions?
Great.
He seemed nice.
Careful newbie
You know I'm hearing it now.
It's kinda annoying when I talk.
I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met
So Elliot's exam was that bad
Dude she violated me.
Ina good way?
What's the deal?
Ah!!!
I think I broke my ass.
I heard
Well of course.
"The hope is, and experience shows that material like this does contribute to reduced civilian casualties and a higher threshold for war and more cautious planning for war."
"And hopefully, in this case, and understanding and careful planning for what the exit policy is for Afghanistan."
This is a war that has been going on now for nine years and is clearly been getting worse for the past three years.
Something has got to change in this equation.
"And soldiers, foot soldiers, are of course victims of war."
"They do benefit to some degree, I mean they benefit in terms of their career and in terms of money."
"These are not people, frequently not people that are totally innocent unless they are conscripts."
And where is he getting all his protein from?
From this.
"His diet consists of roots, shoots, bamboo and banana."
"He is getting all his calcium, all his iron, all his vitamins, all his minerals, the amino acids from this."
You get everything.
Everything.
Here is the new food pyramid.
There are two things.
Your body is like a machine.
Think of your body as a machine.
You have to put the proper fuels in it to get it to work properly.
"If you don't put the proper fuels, it aint gonna work."
"And if you put fuels that aren't as good quality as others, that will lead to heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol."
"It's like, if you take a Porsche, and you fill it up with diesel, what happens?"
"You just screwed your car up, right?"
"And I guarantee what are people gonna say to you, when you say, I put diesel in my car today."
Do you know what they gonna say to you?
I guarantee they are going to say
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No offense.
"When somebody puts a hamburger in their mouth, nobody says"
"What the fuck is wrong, stop!"
Stop!
You get everything.
I know I said to think your body as a machine now think of your body as a house.
I love analogies.
Think of your body as a house.
"To build a house you have to start with the foundation, you can't start with the roof."
Here is the foundation.
This is the foundation.
This is where all of it starts.
The fruits and vegetables.
Brandon:
Ok.
Ok I like that.
That's not one I usually put up there but that's a very good point.
Characters should act like themselves.
And you can't get to know someone if they're not consistent.
"In fact, characters in books tend to be far more consistent than people are in real life."
This is case of truth is stranger than fiction.
"And in the book, you're going to have to give foreshadowing and reasoning for why a character's acting that way if they're acting erratically, which they can do, that in real life you may never not give."
"You might just be a moody person, and you're jumping all over the place."
In the book you'll have to establish that this is a moody person.
"Alright, what else?"
Student:
"They have depths in their interests, and what they think about."
Brandon:
"Ok, depth."
That's a good one.
What else?
Student:
Something you aspire to be.
Brandon:
OK.
That's one of the other big three that I usually point out.
"In a lot of ways, I view characters like this:"
"It's almost like there's a continuum between what we call the ""everyman"" and the ""superman"" or woman."
The idea being that these two things are kind of core concepts that make up what attaches us to a character.
"Either we see what we are in them, or we see what we want to be in them."
And a lot of times you will have books that this is the growth archetype of the character.
Can you think of one of these?
Student:
Star Wars.
Brandon:
Can there be enlightenment  without light?
What does the third eye see?
"Love and respect,'"
"I don't know if it says 'Tim,'"
I am not sure if it's what...
Okay.
"'Buddha,"
Kovan...'?
Am I saying something  like we know?
"'...Shiva, Jesus in [Matthew 6:21] all speaks of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi.'"
He describes it as self-effulgent.
'Can these be...
Can there be enlightenment without light?'
"If enlightenment... we're using this term,  'enlightenment'; enlightenment means to bring light  to the mind, maybe, not to the Self."
"Because even the term 'guru,' it means the remover of darkness, which, here, means ignorance, not the giver of light, even."
But let's speak  about this light.
Does the Self  need to be enlightened?
It cannot be.
"It gives light to consciousness and the mind, but It, itself,  is the source of light."
But light  is also a phenomenon;
light is also perceived.
"Space is also perceived, because it is said that amongst all the elements known to us, that space is the most subtle."
"And we are the perceivers  of space, so something subtler  also than space is here."
To the extent that we can say even the perceiving of space  is perceived.
You cannot use your mind here.
"Mind will only create images and images are gross forms, are emanating out of that."
"The image is itself seen, the image  cannot witness itself."
A cloud doesn't know  it is passing.
A flower doesn't know  it is beautiful.
To whom do they appear?
This one.
And this one sees them with the light of consciousness.
Sunita.
Final year medical student.
You don't know me.
But I know you.
Can I talk to you for two minutes... please?
"As a medical student, I want to know how..."
Camera beeps
What's that?
My camera.
Why is it beeping?
It buzzes every 15 minutes.
"So that I can take photos... of important things, people... to inscribe on them, to remember."
On photos?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Making notes...
"I grew up on Oracle from Oracle four on, and there are some really awesome features in Oracle."
- That's so sad.
- It would take those 3000 queries and actually work whereas mostly [indecipherable]
"- Oh yeah, no, no, no, no."
"The 3000 queries was, in fact, Oracle, and it did, in fact, work just fine eventually."
- 9000 seconds later.
"- It just took a while to run, no problem."
- Are you saying qualifying the dates or indexing the dates or both out of curiosity?
All of the above?
"Oracle dates, time stamps."
"Sequel, JBC when you're using a NS timestamp will output a Java sequel timestamp."
"If you have your Oracle column set to date,"
Oracle then in the database has to convert that Java sequel time stamp into a date.
"If you've used that date, say as a partition column, you're going to have a query that takes 100 to 200 times longer to execute than if you had just passed in a time stamp, or if you used a time stamp for your partition column."
There's a nice work‑around.
I'm not sure if there's a techno publish for it.
1979 I ended up paralysed from the waist down.
The doctor told me I had a tumour on my spinal cord.
"He said that if that tumour is on the inside of the cord, you have"
less than one chance in a million you will ever walk again.
"Made me stop and think for the first time in my life that I was part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"I saw the birds die, I saw the trees die."
I saw the soil changed.
And it was not until I was paralysed that I was willing to admit that I was the problem.
I ended up with a one in a million operation.
"I walked out of the hospital, with a one in a million operation, but I walked out a much different individual than I walked in."
"I knew that what we were doing was wrong, was absolutely, totally non-sustainable."
Here's a scone that my wife made.
Try that.
Vegan.
Everything in the house is vegan.
There's no animal products in anything that we have here.
And it tastes good.
Everybody thought the same way.
It was mass hysteria.
"Everybody was doing it, it must be OK."
You started and went on from the time you were a child.
"And can you imagine what it was like, when I first asked myself the question:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
It was one of the most thought-provoking questions
I had ever had in my life.
"Because I had never even considered that, and when you stop and think about it, it is so straightforward and open:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Do we need them for protein?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Are they good for us?"""
Absolutely not.
"So while I'm fighting in the war,"

Zbruyevka's been freed by some avengers.
Some avengers?
Who are they?
- Nobody knows for sure.
- And if not for sure?
Have you contacted them?
That's impossible.
- Why not?
- They are not there.
- Who is not there?
- The avengers.
"- And Zbruyevka, is it there?"
"And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour, boil them up, use the oil."
"They also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks."
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- the finning of sharks.
"We're often frightened of sharks, thanks to ""Jaws."""
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
"There was someone recently, wasn't there?"
Just a couple weeks ago.
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
"So I don't know what the balance is, but I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them."
It was a well-documented fishery.
"As you can see here, it peaked in the '50s, where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year."
"And it declined very fast -- a classic boom-and-bust fishery, which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates."
"They killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,"
literally just by stringing a Manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
"Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s, especially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford."
"About two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85, mainly by Norwegian vessels."
Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good

Hi guys.
"This is Max Tapper again, for Howcast."
What I'm going to do today is talk about a set.
"So, what exactly is a set?"
A set basically is just a certain number of repetitions that you choose to do in any exercise.
"So, say if I pick up a dumbbell and I want to work my chest and I'm going 10 to 12 repetitions, after 12 repetitions, that is one set."
Okay?
"Now, you can choose different repetitions for different reasons, depending on what you're trying to achieve."
Let's say your goal is just complete strength.
A lot of times they'll do six sets of repetitions.
"If your goal is to build muscle, like hypertrophy, then we'll work somewhere between 10 - 12 repetitions, and that's one set."
"If your goal is for endurance, then you're doing 15-20 reps, and that is still one set."
"So, a set basically is just a certain amount of repetitions."
That's all.
All right guys?
Get out there.
Do your sets and be safe.

Twist bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist a chain of two pink bubbles.
Twist a gray bubble.
I didn't twist one pink bubble.
OK.
Now we good.
Lock the free end of the seventh gray bubble with the free end of the eighth pink bubble.
Twist the seventh yellow and the eighth gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh yellow and eighth gray bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth yellow and the seventh red bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh red and eighth yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth red bubble.
Lock the free end of the red eighth bubble between the seventh and the eighth pink bubbles.
It's important to make this connection working in the same direction around the row.
Changing the direction will result in making different shape.
We will talk about it in separate instruction.
Or just explore it on your own.
We have made the base of the cabin.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
The side view.
Here is the bottom view.
We have to fix the bottom a little bit latter.
First we will finish the cabin
"Again, there are various ways to do it."
Let's twist ninth bubble of each color.
And we lock free ends of ninth bubbles in one lock twist.
It is a way to make one of the simplest cabins.
Congratulations.
We have made the crane tower with a cabin.
We can cut off the rest of the balloons.
Or we can use remains of the balloons to decorate the crane tower.

Barbara!
"Barbara, you still wanna go through with it, don't you?"
"I don't know, I just don't see how I could marry a man without loving him."
Oh but darling listen
How long does love last?
And besides it's just as easy to fall in love with a millionaire as it is with a truck driver
From what you say you must be very attractive to some women

"After all the McNeill Steel Works, you know?"
Some girls will put up with an awful lot if a fella's got money.
"Yes, is it awful?"
I could never understand.
We're going to have a wonderful life together.
"Where will we live, darling?"
Where would you like to live?
"Oh, anywhere."
Cozy little hut is good enough for me.
"Oh me, oh mi-ami"

You'll celebrate a brand of love
I go round in a trance
You got folks in your glance
We got ants in our plants
You started something
"Yes you did, but you didn't know what I knew"
I knew right away that you were my new romance
Come Venus and love
How lovely the world will be
Now that you're in love with me
"Well, the first seven questions on Assignment [unknown], all focus on the precise use of language."
"So, I'll let you discuss those with the other students."
And without the consent of the possessed... ...the exorcism ritual can't be performed.
Did you encourage her to eat?
"Yes, every time I saw her... ...but the few times she tried, it seemed like..."
"Seemed like she couldn't swallow, or she couldn't keep it down."
What about medical care?
I wanted her to continue.
I never said she should quit seeing her doctors.
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.
But you did suggest she stop taking the drug Gambutrol.
Yes.
"After the exorcism, she asked for my counsel."
She told me that the drugs had never helped her.
"After all, she was on Gambutrol during the exorcism... ...when her so-called symptoms were at their peak."
"Ultimately, we both felt that she was beyond medical care... ...and that she had to see this through to the end... ...by faith alone."
The dual voices we just heard on this tape... ...you're certain that they were both coming from Emily at the same time?
Yes.
"Yes, I heard them."
Have you tampered with this tape in any way?
No.
"No, I have not."
No further questions at this time.
Mr. Thomas.
"Father Moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?"
I think it's a record of certain indications... ...that Emily was possessed.
"Signs of possession, you may call them."
"By ""signs of possession,"" would you mean her speaking in languages... ...we might assume she couldn't possibly know?"
And the vocalization of two distinct voices simultaneously?
Yes.
Among other signs that I observed and described to the court... ...while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.
Things you can't hear on the tape.
"I want to go to him, Brij let me go!"
"The album was recorded at the Vortex Jazz Club in an afternoon on 4th November 2010, in London, UK."
The music happened spontaneously.
Nothing was premeditated.
"We are affectioned to songs and structures that are born free, but balance themselves out."
Sometimes I'm playing something and I tell myself:
"""I got out of this place!"""
Nice is the water
Nice is the landscape and nice is the possibility for us to be there.
Exactly.
Sometimes we arrive at a place and we really do!
Wow!
Wow!
It was great!
"It was a cool sound man, wasn't it?"
"Yes, I feel it, great!"
Cool!

Alright welcome back.
A little new idea for you here and this one applies to learning and most certainly would threaten to turn our current educational system on its head.
What's unclear is whether it's good for America.
"A California school called the Khan Academy is reinventing traditional teaching by giving students lectures that they can watch at home on their own time, re-watch them if they'd like and then having them do the homework when they're in school in the classroom."
Salman:
"By removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self pace lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom."
"Pennycress is a winter annual, and the seeds contain a very high oil percent."
"This crop is easily grown and harvested, with minimal affect on soybean production."
"And Terry concluded that if pennycress was planted in all soybean fields, off season, at 1,000 pounds per acre yield, it could produce about 3.8 billion gallons of additional bio-diesel."
And the remaining meal can also be used as an organic fertilizer and natural weed killer for
"low-acreage, high-value crops."
It's also a source of monomer for bio-based plastics.

Hi Hannah.
Tell me a little bit about your internship this summer with Dr. Phippen.
I understand you were working on his US Department of Agriculture grant?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I got to work at the University of illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
[Text on screen:
"Hannah, UlUC] with small grains."
So wheat and oats.
And I got to do a lot of data collection on trying to find the best variety of wheat and oats.
And lots of work out the field.
Beth Seaton:
So are you a student at the University of illinois?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I'll be transferring there in the fall."
So I'll be a junior in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
So what kind of advice would you give to anybody who is considering this sort of agricultural internship?
Hannah:
"I would say, definitely go for it."
"Because, I didn't know anything before"
I started it.
I got to learn a lot about different crops and
I got to get some hands-on experience before I started in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
There is also a beautiful rainbow in between.
Everything is just as he said.
But where is he?
He is not to be seen.
"Hey rain, are you pouring down only here.. ..or even at the place where he is?"
If you do so then he will think there is no rain.. .. and will not come.
Why dont you please rain at his place too?
"My dear, my cute rain!"
Please rain at his place also.
Do you believe at least now that rain unites both of us?
I already believe that.
It seems you did not believe completely.
Because you came so close but stayed that far.
Let the distance between the hearts melt slowly
Let me slowly open the door of naughty thoughts
The sky is sending down rain threads of love
And making a garland with rain drops as flowers
At this pleasant moment when it drenched us .. .. and joined us by the rainbow of love
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me proclaim that you are mine
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me establish this bond forever.
In your twists and turns I can see the beauty of lightning
I am seeing your spectacular dance in this first rain
I can hear your voice in this thunder
And do I hear your signals through.. ..the sounds of these rain drops
I am following the track of your heart
Shall I follow your foot steps as your wife
In this wetness when your shyness went away
Can any curtain stop your eagerness
I am gifting my beauty to your eyes
Let these rain drops show me your treasures
And let me remain indebted to the god of rain
I cannot stop the anxious youth anymore
"You guys, we live in this world where sexuality is kind of the center of everything."
At the center of how we think about relationships.
At the center of how we think about pleasures.
The center of how we think about a lot of aspects of our lives.
"And so asexual people are, you know, when I was in high school and middle school,"
"I had no idea how to think about relationships,"
I didn't know what was going on with me.
No one was talking about the fact that-
Star:
"So, you're a young man and you're an asexual and you don't have the same sexual feelings, you feel lost."
Like you're odd man out because nobody's telling you why you're not having the feelings that everyone else is talking about.
David:
No one's telling you that it's okay.
And no one's giving kind of a space and words you can use to talk about it.
Chandra:
You said middle school.
Is that how young you were when you found out?
David:
"Yeah, I was 13, 14 when I realized that, I mean, pretty much what all my friends started being sexual, I was just kind of like, ""All right"
"I know, have no way to figure out what's going on"" [laughter]"
I had no context to understand it.
And so I kind of figured out for myself.
"Well, I'm not experiencing these things."
I must be asexual.
Joy:
"Well, maybe it's repressed sexuality."
"Rather than, you know, that you're just like a normal guy walking around."
Maybe it's repressed because you don't want to face what the sexuality might look like.
Could that be?
Lie down.
[laughter]
David:
I don't want to be involved in this anymore.
"Believe me, I wouldn't ask you this if there was any other solution."
"How could you believe that this is the only solution, Yasar?"
Enough...
Stop reminding Mustafa of Narin anymore.
Isn't everybody trying to make Mustafa forget her and get out of the hospital?
"If my brother forgets Narin, he will also forget himself."
"I thought like you, I wanted him to forget Narin..."
"But, he is my brother."
"When we take Narin out of him, we see that there is nothing left."
"And, you will see it as well."
You will understand.
It is true that we gave Mustafa Bulut high dosage medicine.
But this can't be the only reason for him shutting himself off and not remembering anybody.
He refuses to eat and take a test.
"In fact, he is aware of everything."
What he went through and being here affect his situation as well.
"For every patient in this kind of situation, there is a circumstance that initiates the healing period."
A constant that attaches him to the life.
- What can it be?
- It can be anything.
"Something he hid in the deepest corner of his mind, something he didn't share with anybody,"
Something that he would never give up even though he could give up on everything else
An object...
A memory...
A person...
We honorably succeeded in every war within 10 years.
"In 10 years, we created 15 million young people at every age..."
Sahan came here from Diyarbakir Prison.
He had very difficult times there.
"Now, whenever he sees somebody with uniform, he stands at ""Attention"" and starts singing a march."
We built railroad tracks across the country...
What happened about scouting that kid I mentioned earlier?
It's me.
Did you think about what I said last time?
I want to know first why you put forth those conditions?
I thought you told me to tell you what I wanted.
"If you interfere in my private life, I can't work with you."
Are you calculating which of the two will be more profitable?
I have to leave as I have an appointment.
I will call you back.
"Fine, do that."
But I can't wait long.
"As you know, there are many places that want me."
Call me soon.
President.
What is it?
Doctor Cho called several times.
It's Kang Hwi's examination results.
He asked me to give them to you directly.
"Alright, you may leave."
What do you mean blind?
His eye...
Are you saying that he is going to become blind?
Yes.
"Depending on the degree of damage to his optical nerves, he may be able to maintain a very slight vision."
"However, even that is hard to guarantee."
What about the treatment method?
"If the optical nerves become damaged, it is impossible to recover."
There is no special treatment as of now.
"In the case of Kang Hwi, the rate of progress is very fast."
Probably it is because of the characteristics of the work.
"Fatigue and stress are problems,  but strong lights are also fatal. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; President, only you will suffer like this. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I can't wait long. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is an important time now! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; There is no treatment."
"Look for a plane ticket, the quickest one."
And I saw something lying on the sidewalk.
*It was a gold locket... *
*... with the initials E. C.B.* *engraved on it. *
My middle name is Christine.
Erin Christine Bruner.
"And of all the people walking by that day, I found that locket."
What are the chances of that?
"I don't know, maybe it was a sign."
Or maybe it was just some incredible coincidence.
"But it made me feel... ...like no matter what mistakes I've made in the past... ...at that moment, I was exactly where I was meant to be."
Like I was on the right path.
You sound more like a mystic than an agnostic.
Are you wearing the locket now?
No.
You should.
The archdiocese doesn't want you to testify.
They're just afraid that I'll embarrass them.
Testify to some medieval-sounding supernatural nonsense.
They're expecting me to talk you out of it.
I've just decided I'm not even gonna try.
Why not?
If the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment... ...they need you to walk out of here a free man.
I believe a jury will find you sincere and credible... ...and when Dr. Cartwright corroborates your testimony... ...and refutes the prosecution's medical arguments... ...we'll get an acquittal.
And everyone will thank me for it.
Emily!
God help me.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"Father Moore, before you could perform the exorcism... ...you had to get the sanction of the Church, correct?"
"Yes, on October the 27th of last year... ...I presented my assessment and recommendation to the archbishop... ...and he authorized the exorcism that day before I left the office."
Tell us what happened that night.
I drove home.
And then they feel very happy here.
And I am happy when I see they are happy.
What impresses me the most is the credit from my customers.
"Before, when we were still not ready to open the fish-watching area."
Sometimes the customers would complain about us.
"But then later, after two or three months, the customers came back again"
He said
"I would like to come back, because I appreciate your service attitude"
This made me very happy
I was so touched.
Then all what they used to complain or even scold at me is nothing to me at all.
"With their credit and appreciation, I feel I need to work harder."
I should work harder to have the people see what we own.
"Here these ""screws"" got much ""torture"" from us"
Yap......
Because sometimes we force them to learn
And also we give them much pressure
"But from all this, you can see, from the first year, the second year, to the third year......"
"Everybody has improved himself gradually, everyone"
"Little by little, they are not afraid of approaching people"
"Gradually, they become more willing to try new things"
"Before, they always said, ""No, I don't want, I can't"""
We are happy when we see they are changing their attitude gradually.
These employees have grown up.
"So, the happiness is,"
That I put emotion whenever I am cooking
That I learn what I didn't know
That a tour guide shows me a Like!
"That means, yes, you are doing better"
Welcome to Tanayiku!
Many small pieces of Happiness here Pile up a big Blessing!

This is SlSTAR
The title song is more  mass oriented song
"In one words, it's like intensity"
"I think it's wanting love, so I think it's loneliness"
I thought it had a lot  of colors to it
Every one of us has  our own part in it
It's a little bit different from the old songs
There are a lot of point  choreography on stage
"For me, I have dance with  a male dancer"
"When Bora is dancing, magic powder comes down"
"For Dasom, she uses  stick and hat to show"
Musical side of the song
We are together again after  a bit of Unit activities
And it's really great to  come back with regular album
We all have very different  colors of our own
You will get to know each members better with the song
Please love us
"This was SlSTAR, thank you!"
Would I get  married before 30
My heat is already tired  from giving love oh
Even from the raindrop sound  My heart hurts
I'm still young and delicate  Naïve and delicate
Have a lot of tears
I cry and ask for it
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
Would you come  before morning
"I only have you,  like a fool Oh"
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
I cry and ask for it
"If you have ever put your head on a washing machine, that's how it felt."
That's how I heard the airplane.
It's a dream come true for me.
I wanted to be instrument rated for a long time and now I can fly blind and deaf!

I'm up in the clouds and it is freedom.
That's what it is.
It's all about freedom.
Announcer:
"With his high energy, warm hearted style; Stephen Hopson, a gifted story teller, unpacks the steps to overcoming adversity, which he calls the ""HEAR PRlNClPLE."""
Have a passion.
Entertain the possibilities.
Act on your intuition.
Remember the people who helped you.
Stephen:
"Without passion, you can't go anywhere."
You are stuck where you are.
"But with passion, you will be amazed at how doors of opportunity will open up for you."
Announcer:
"Along the way to becoming a pilot, Stephen's passion opened up another door of opportunity, which led him to become a successful broker on Wall Street with Merril Lynch."
But there were obstacles along that path as well.
Stephen:
"In order to overcome adversity, you need to be able to trust your instincts."
I saw an advertisement in the paper for stock brokers and I thought what a good career change that might be.
So I called up the guy for the interview.
I had an interview with the vice-president.
"I walked into his office, I was really nervous."
I was intimidated.
The office reeked of wealth.
I met with him for twenty minutes.
"He said, ""OK, you are meeting with twelve people on my floor."""
"""Each and every one of them said you're not going to make it."
"Now, let's emulate some waveform debugging."
The question here is in which of these cycles is the protocol being violated?
"Remember, the packet starts when the valid signal goes high."
It gets interrupted by the suspend signal.
"And then, the packet ends, when the valid goes low and the parity byte gets transmitted."
We are only
looking at the control signal here.
Please go ahead and check off the cycles from one to seven.
Which one of these is a protocol violation?
Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were doing your performance?
It's nerve-wrecking.

Somebody had suggested that maybe we wouldn't be a real band unless we played live.
We must do it now.
This was a moment to actually see if we could put off any kind of existence.
BE ACTUAL INSTEAD OF VlRTUAL.
"I was over there and I had this big, fat white speaker and you could see my showbusiness in a nice, big white speakerhead."
And I had the laptop.
I had to put it on my feet for it not to be seen.
We're not really playing with a laptop.
"It kind of felt like a weird kind of karaoke gig, didn't it?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
- Risky karaoke.
We had our friends and stuff in the audience.
It was definitely full to the back cause it was a small venue.
Those were the day when performing was the scary experience where I kind of escape from my body. to get me through the gig and then would come out the other side:
"""Oh!"
Did we do it?
It's rendered to the point of being dry.
"Yeah, you may have some crisp on the skin, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but bananas?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I mean, it's like,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is this a joke?"
"It looks like you plated it and then stepped on it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sadly, the cook&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the banana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is better than the cook on the duck."
Bananas with duck...
You've gone bananas!
That's what's happened.
You've gone [Bleep] bananas.
"The hero of the dish, in my mind, should have been the duck."
You have managed to cook the duck.
Everything else around that is dreadful.
"Samantha, the dish please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Graham)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Samantha) Um, it's pan-seared duck breast of a sweet potato-rhubarb puree, served with a eggplant Napoleon."
You know that that's not cooked.
- Right?
"- I do, sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And you put it&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on a plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Raw duck and, like, the leaning tower of dryness."
This is not what we're looking for.
"This is bad on so many levels, it's kind of hard to explain. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Scott, let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Um, what is that?"
It's a profitol... profiterole with a mashed-up sweet potato and a slice of the duck.
Two whole duck breasts equates to three miniature slices of duck.
- Where's the rest of it?
- I honestly got scared.
"It's embarrassing, Scott."
"Well, at least after the raw duck, we have a duck that has actually seen the frying pan. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You thought&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it would impress us&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that you could put a slice of duck breast"
- in a profiterole?
- A little over-creative.
Over-creative?
Delusional.
Three embarrassing dishes.
I'm scared.

And I talked to her.
"I said ""Nadia, you are clearly a bright girl --"
And we share a certain amount of DNA --
"There is no way that you should be tracked into a slower math class."""

It's not cursed.

"I got to thinking about relationships, about how people fall in love..."
Have kids
Grow old together
And say goodbye
And then for some reason I thought about the circus but then I was back on relationships...
"Back to your room Mr. Johnson, you've got one ventricle!"
"And I couldn't help thinking that maybe it wasn't luck that made relationships last, maybe it was just a matter who takes fewer hits"
I never take any cold showers for example.
And I cannot do all these nice exercises.
But I want to ask you something:  do you like organic food?
Can you raise your hand who likes organic food?
"Yeah, you are the problem."
"Because, every morning I fall into deep depression for ten seconds."
"Because, I sit on the toilet- (Straining sounds) and then, basically, I'll show you what it means."
I make excrement.
Like a baby.
And that's what you do as well.
But isn't it amazing?
"That's not one organic label which allows, my excrements are included, not one, whatever you do when- (Strains) never allows me to be involved."
And that's a problem.
"So, we are in deep shit, because we don't respect shit."
(Laughter)
"We can do a lot of innovations, we can look at things, and make them differently."
We can reduce our ecologic footprint.
"For example, people say,"
"""Please protect the environment; don't make so much waste."""
"Please protect the environment, don't use so much water;"
"""Please protect the environment; don't use your car so often."""
"So this is what we're calling ""environmental protection""."
When we destroy a little less.
"That's the same as if you say, ""Please, protect your child; beat your child only three times, instead of five times."""
We think we protect when we destroy less.
"But it's not protecting, it's only minimizing the destruction."
And this is where we are.
"We make waste all over the planet, and it looks crazy."
Why can't we make a different thing?
Why can't we make a footprint which is beneficial?
But this is what we do.
We try to be less bad.
"6 divided by 287 and that gives me 0.021, carrying one extra significant figure."
"And if I now take that probability and I plug this into here, I've already done a calculation."
I got a table here.
I find that that diameter to the correct number of significant figures is 0.7.
And the actual diameter of these balls is 0.8.
So you guys did a very great job.
[APPLAUSE]
All right.
This works.
That's how they calculated the diameter of the nucleus.
That's it.
Nothing else involved in this.
That is the principle behind how it was done.
Very simple.
That is the principle behind how the quark was discovered and the size of the quark was revealed.
That is terrific.
"Now, we've got the problem that the scientific community had in 1911, 1912, right after the discovery of the nucleus."
"And the problem is, now we know the atom has got a nucleus, we know it has got an electron, what is the structure of the atom?"
How does the electron and the nucleus hang together?
"In particular, what we have to do is we have to ask what is the force of attraction that keeps the nucleus and the electron together?"
"We are going to talk, here, about this classical description of the atom."
And we've got to talk about the force of the interaction first.
"Well, there are four known fundamental forces."
What is the force that is the weakest force?
Gravity.
Absolutely.
What is the force that is the next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.
Absolutely.
What is the next stronger force?
Weak force.
And the next force?
lots of opportunities for students.
Beth Seaton:
That's wonderful.
So tell me how you're involving students in the project.
Win Phippen:
Great!
"A lot of private seed companies, breeding seed companies, especially for corn and soybeans, are trying to get students re-energized about the field of plant breeding."
"And so this grant allows for students to do internship projects, and that's on the entire summer, time to work with these private companies."
"And so, this year, we have four interns."
One is at Pioneer Hybrid
Another one is over at Iowa State University.
And another one is with the USDA in Peoria.
And I have another one here at Western.
"And another one that is at the University of illinois,"
learning about bio-energy crops.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Tell me about why plant breeding is important to the USDA and to the general population.
Because I don't really know too much about plant breeding.
Win Phippen:
"Well, a plant breeder is the person who takes undomesticated plants."
These are plants that haven't been considered for commercial production.
"Let's say a plant has a very strong, sort of, pharmaceutical properties to it."
And we want to a...
"Instead of trying to synthetically make in the labs, sometimes it is easier to have the plants produce these particular compunds."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And so the plant breeder is the one who would go out in the wild, collect up the wild plants of these particular species, and they'd start doing some crosses."
And they would try to make different combinations of these plants to create a plant that would be suitable for commerical production.

I like you O Nijam girl and you are my princess
Welcome my dear prince and take this young beauty with you
If you give me your hand I will take.. ..you atop the elephant with me
Arrange for the musical band for our marriage.
I will come with you
This girl has eagerly accepted my proposal
Let us come together and steal each others hearts
Talk sweetly and open the treasure of my beauty
You too became intelligent
Because you pampered me
I laid a path of jasmines for you.
Come to me running
I heart found the priest of love and could not escape from him
Be the deity in the temple of my heart
I am intoxicated with your love and come to you
I will blow away with you like a gale
My shyness became an hurdle
I will drive it away by kissing your cheek
Drown me with your kisses and lift me in your embrace
Become the beautiful day once and a lovely night once
We must be exited each time we embrace
I lost all my prestige.

Have you heard of the Meatrix?
The Meatrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
OK.
"The Meatrix is all around you, Leo."
It is the story we tell ourselves about where meat and animal products come from.
This family farm is a fantasy.
"Take the blue pill and stay here in the fantasy, take the red pill and I will show you the truth."
Welcome to the real world.
Whoah!
What is this horrible place?
"This is a factory farm, Leo."
"Places like this are where most eggs, milk and meat come from."
How did this happen?
I'll show you.
"In the mid 20th century, greedy agriculture corporations began modifying sustainable family farming to maximize their profits at great cost to both humans and animals."
Factory farming was born.
Animals are packed as closely together as possible.
"Most never see sunlight, touch ground or get fresh air."
Many can't even turn around.
These cruel conditions cause fights and disease amongst the animals.
"To fix this, the corporate machine began systematic mutilation, practices such as de-beaking chickens."
"And they started adding a constant dosage of antibiotics to their feed, just to keep these poor wretches alive."
This overuse of antibiotics breed super strains of resistant disease-causing germs.
Every day we get closer to an epidemic that cannot be stopped.
Eeeuw!
What's that smell?
12 million pounds of excrement!
This pollutes the air and ground water.
That's why communities near factory farms often suffer from high levels of related sicknesses.
"Well, it smells like shhhhh ..."
Why aren't they talking now?
Why don't they take Agi's side now and support her?

NARRATOR:
Are you a survivor?
In the world's harshest environments... we're wimps compared to the toughest creatures on the planet.
We're counting down the ultimate top ten survivors in the natural world to find the animal with the most extraordinary endurance.
"When the going gets tough, the tough really get going on the Ultimate Animal Countdown."
[engine sputtering]
MAN:
"Mayday, mayday!"
[alarm beeping]
NARRATOR:
"Could you cope with nature's worst crashes, cataclysms, and catastrophes?"
We're counting down the world's toughest animals--
Surviving against the odds for days... months... or years.
"A hurricane unleashes the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs."
"In Florida, it wreaks havoc on land... and sea..."
The storm surge sweeps fish onto shore--
leaving them stranded.
Including the animal swimming into number 10:
Reef sharks.
Shallow water is their nursery.
But sharks are survivors.
They avoid bad weather... tipped off by their super-sensitive ears.
The shark's inner ear is similar to ours and can detect changes in pressure.
Useful when it dives deep... or when a hurricane approaches-- but we only discovered by accident.
"Sir, if you saw someone eating insects... ...on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?"
"- Probably, yes."
- So can you say with confidence... ...that the behavior you saw in your daughter's bedroom... ...could not be the behavior of someone suffering from psychosis?
I don't know.
She never had any problems like that before.
It just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
"- And you trusted him, right?"
- Yes.
He is our parish priest.
Fair enough.
"And after that night, would you say that you... ...put your daughter entirely in Father Moore's care?"
Yes.
We had done all we could.
We said she was in his hands now... ...body and soul.
Thank you.
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
You may step down.
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry... ...at Northwestern University.
Where did you receive your education?
"At Yale, and then at Cambridge."
And what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures... ...and the physiological and psychological changes... ...they undergo during these experiences.
Would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Yes.
"""Possession"" is one term for a basic human experience... ...reported by a great number of people all around the world."
"In my fieldwork, I've seen many people who experienced... ...a sense of being invaded by an entity from the supernatural realm."
Why do you think Emily was invaded?
Why did this possession happen to her?
Based on my study of the case file... ...I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
"A person with an unusual connection... ...to what Carlos Castaneda called ""the separate reality."""
"I'm looking at a list of your published articles, doctor."
You've been quite busy and prolific.
"So based on your time spent with Holy Roller snake-handlers... ...voodoo priestesses and Indians tripping on peyote buds... ...based on observing these bizarre individuals... ...you've concluded that possession is... ...a basic, typical human experience?"
"I must say, counselor... ...that's quite a laundry list of disdain... ...and one that thoroughly mischaracterizes my research."
"No, I don't think possession is a typical experience."
But I am convinced that it is a scientifically verified... ...culturally universal one.
Have you ever used Gambutrol in your studies... ...to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
Absolutely not.
That would be dangerous to the patient.
"So this notion of Gambutrol locking someone in a possessed state... ...the key to your assertion that her medical treatment harmed Emily... ...this would be your own pet theory, correct?"
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained.
"Although I think he's just taking a page from your book, counselor."
No further questions.
Erin!
I've got a doctor who wants to testify.
"He's an eyewitness, Erin."
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.
- What?
- He called us.
"Dr. Graham Cartwright, Department of Abnormal Psychiatry... ...at St. Mary's Hospital."
Dr. Cartwright.
Ring a bell?
Yes.
He was there?
- Yes.
"- Father... ...if you want me to defend you, you've got to give me... ...all the information I need."
With all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution... ...how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
He asked that I keep his involvement confidential... ...and I said I would.
What's his name?
"I don't know, but he is like my brother"
He was killed by an APC running over him
My name is Ibrahim Azzouz
"They [army] created a trap for us, they let us approach the Radio &amp;amp; Television building"
Then the army ranks advanced on us
They began by firing shots at us
"After that they beat us with sticks, bringing us to the ground"
"After a while, the army APCs started driving around recklessly"
The APCs then started driving into the crowds hitting people
"Some people had their faces crushed in, some were sliced in half"
These were scenes of inhumane acts
From the army!
The Army that is supposed to protect us!
Our Army crushed us like cattle!
"Give us a chance to unite, we are brothers"
Patience ...
Patience
"Someone from Ezbet Nakhl, and the brother of Mina that they killed and have been laid to rest inside - Who has done this?"
The terrorist Tantawi ...
The Marshal ... he killed the young people inside
"But he is blind, because if he acknowledges those before him that are now in prison, he would not act this way"
"But the day will come, when God will take from him as he took from those that have been killed"
Not just him .. all of them
And may God put me to rest like those here
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The events of last night in front of Maspero [Egyptian Radio &amp;amp; Television Building]
Have resulted in the deaths of 24 Martyrs amongst our children
So let's talk about your characters.
Your characters are what can... are going to drive your book.
I didn't nail it.
I screwed it up.
"Christine, let's go, please."
(Christine) I sauteed some onions with scallops and chicken stock that I had infused with smashed garlic and chili peppers.
You were almost frazzled by this dish.
"You have a extraordinary palate, but I think that one is subpar."
"Next up, Ryan."
"We have portobello, dried shiitake, and morel mushrooms."
I made a duxelle out of the three of them so that I can incorporate the mushrooms in every bite.
The consistency of the risotto itself was spot on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good technique&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the rice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Good job.
- Thank you very much.
"- All right, Scott."
"- Good luck, Scotty."
Let's do this.
This elimination challenge is definitely a chance for me to redeem myself with the judges.
"It means everything to show them that I can not only just bounce back, but actually really shine."
You think this has it?
Is this gonna be good?
I went back to where I normally cook.
I went as simple and core as I could to let the risotto speak for itself.
Seven ingredients in this entire dish.
- The texture's nice.
"- Thank you, chef."
Huge improvement over the last dish that we saw.
"A spirited effort, and, uh, welcome back to the contest."
"Thank you, Joe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So the next risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we want to taste&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is from Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Joe is definitely the scariest judge.
"He's the judge to win over, and, if I can do that, then the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; title is definitely mine."
"I made a pistachio, cranberry, cherry, and gooseberry risotto."
What's this?
What is this baby powder-looking stuff?

"Congratulations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The cranberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the nuts, the gooseberries,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; already just unheard of in a risotto."
That is a disaster.

"I'm looking at my dish, the plating and everything was fantastic."
"My dish came out exactly how I wanted, and I feel very confident."
"What we have here is some morel mushrooms, some portobello mushrooms."
"Used some veal stock, a sauvignon blanc."
Did you wash the mushrooms?
I didn't wash them out completely.
"If they're not rinsed super well, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;especially the morels,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it's like a dirt sponge,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and you taste that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and it's just gritty.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
It's just really bad.
Don't grab a morel. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why do you tell me&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what to avoid?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I'm here to eat the dish or should I eat selectively?
As you wish.
[Utensils clatter]
A little too sandy for me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Big mistake.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Guys, some basic stuff &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;like feeding us sand&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and things like that,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; not good."
I screwed up.
But I hope that they're able to see through that and still see my culinary greatness.
"We tasted some fantastic risottos and, sadly, some disastrous risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We now need to come up&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with a decision."
(Announcer) The judges must now decide which home cooks are the bottom three.
"From these, one more person will be sent home tonight."
"For six months, heavy rains cause rivers to rise."
Forests to flood.
The Amazon and its tributaries overflow an area about the size of California.
Which poses real problems for ants.
Their homes can be covered with over 30 feet of water for months at a time.
"To survive the flood, ants need to build an ark."
It's a raft.
A miracle of biological engineering.
"None of the ants are submerged, or even get wet."
"Their water-repellent bodies push against the surface, shaping it into a bowl-- without breaking the surface tension."
Nature's Noahs are number 8 in the countdown because the ant's ark can ride out the flood for months.
It holds millions of passengers with zero casualties.
Unless it runs into pirates.
Heat is another killer.
"Out of the shade of the forest, the larvae are suffering."
Workers carry them to the edge of the raft and dip them in the cool water.
The fight for survival doesn't end when the colony runs aground.
Scouts race ahead to find a new nest site.
Others unload the women and children.
Soon the ants will be safe in a new nest.
Until the next flood.
Drought is deadly.
"Without water, some animals are forced to leave."
Others do something unbelievable.
Tiger salamanders become cannibals.
"In the shallow ponds of Arizona, juvenile tiger salamanders come in two types-- both with feathery gills."
Mom has no gills and lays eggs.
But not all eggs are created equal.
Scientists discovered the tiger salamander has a unique way to survive drought.
Some eggs carry the genetic blueprints to become harmless plankton feeders.
Others become cannibals.
"A month after hatching, they transform into killers, with big teeth and big heads."
- Why do you think it appeared to you?
"I believe the demonic can appear as an apparition... ...much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear."
"- Did it excite your fear, Father?"
- It scared the hell out of me.
"So this night, when you began to prepare Emily's exorcism... ...was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?"
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?
I've seen it ever since.
No further questions at this time.
"Redirect, Your Honor."
"Father Moore, after you received the bishop's authorization... ...when did you proceed with an exorcism?"
October 31st.
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?
Halloween tradition is based on legends throughout history... ...that indicate a real increase in spiritual activity on that night... ...and I thought we could use the occasion to draw them into the open.
"- The demons, you mean?"
- Yes.
Father Moore... ...can you identify this?
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.
Inside is the tape I made that night.
Why would you make such a tape?
Ever since the technology has been available... ...exorcists have used tape recorders to authenticate the ritual... ...and provide a record for review.
I offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...
Objection.
The people were not aware of the existence of this tape... ...until last night.
- Neither were we.
This tape is new evidence that came into our possession yesterday.
We provided counsel for the people with a transcript of its contents.
You mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
"No, Your Honor."
"We received it from a reluctant witness... ...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also be called to testify to its authenticity."

"Can we act in a group, can we pull together?"
Ole:
"Yes, if we don't lift as a mass but as a Community"
"How do you see these ""occupied movement""?"
Is that community or is that mass?
Ole:
"Uhhhmmm .... they have a characteristic of the mass .. spontaneity, right? they are not organized .. but at the same time they are... directed at a goal and driven by an idealism and it moves them out of the mass concept"
Martin:
"And as you see it, the ideal and the goal is what?"
Ole:
"To prevent that resources are wasted and that human selfishness will shape government policies and in any way, the whole human living conditions"
"The mass never act normative, if it does, it is directed"
Martin:
It will be overruled?
Ole:
"Yes, as Hitler led the masses.."
Old:
But if the mass really follow standards that are freely chosen by the individual it's no longer a mass.. but something different.. movement
Martin:
But don't you see it as a movement?
Ole:
"Yes I do, also because they recruit to many different groups in society, right and to many age groups which is also extremely interesting"
Martin:
"Yes, but now as a global Prime Minister, you can do what you want, but"
You're also allowed to put some of these philosophical considerations on the line
Anything we could do in there?
I had another guest who suggested that we should teach philosophy right from the early grades

"But no matter what, you know how there's a saying, ""home is where the heart is?"" That's like what I feel about our dojo."
"It doesn't matter, like, where we are -- it's the people in it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;EBATA:"

People who enjoy or love aikido or martial arts can come together in their own space and kind of... be with other people who have the same kind of passion or enjoyment of that.

"I think at some point, you know, there's not going to be any more dust and we won't have to wear a mask while practicing."

Let's draw our hopes
How far does this sky continue?
The world we know is so narrow
"When we hear somebody's voice asking for help, we decide to pretend we didn't hear it"
By fighting we reaffirm the worth of our existence and then find doubt in our hearts
"Finding differences to not be ""individualities"" but ""enemies"", we become stubborn and push others away"
Our relationships with people became dominating and not something that ties together
Hold my hands and listen to my voice
"The world becomes colorful, you don't have to hate since you can bond beautifully"
"There are no useless lives, let's accept each other"
The infinitely extending canvas becomes dyed in hope
"We all have brushes called ""being ourselves"""

Let's draw our hopes

Just wait for us to rest from resting
And we'll begin to rest with doubled ardor!

We're quite content to be the odd browser out.
We don't have a fancy stock abbreviation to go along side our name in the press.
We don't have a profit margin.
We don't have sacred rockstars that we put above others.
"We don't make the same deals, sign the same contracts, or shake the same hands as anyone else."
And all of this is fine by us.
"We are a pack of independently spirited, fiercely unconventional people, who do things a little differently."
While other companies may value the bottom line we value.. well.. values.
"When a competitor considers making something proprietary, we strive to set it free."
"And while most products and technologies are developed behind closed doors, ours are cultivated out in the open for everyone to see."
"We're not beholden to stake, share or powerholders."
We answer to no one but you.
"And we don't operate this way for the fun of it, even though it is incredibly fun."
We operate this way because we believe it is the right thing to do.
We believe in principle over profit.
2 - with 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 zeros to the right.
Definitely significant because there is a decimal point in the number.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9.
9 total significant figures here.
"And finally, the number here."
Zeros to the left of significant digits are never significant.
"Zeros to the right - these three will be significant because of that decimal point, which means that there is a total of six significant digits in this number."
"So to quickly review our three main cases - zero sandwiched between non-zero significant digits - always significant. zeros to the left, or coming before non-zero digits - never significant. and if zeros come to the right of non-zero significant digits, they're only significant if there's a decimal place in the answer."
So - now I hope all this is crystal clear.
I hope you're really comfortable with it.
So now we'll go on to the next videos.
"We'll talk about how to multiply, divide, subtract and add numbers that have zeros and significant figures."

Which blueprint they follow depends on the weather.
"If their pond remains full... the harmless small heads dominate, feeding on plankton."
"But if the summer rains fail, a shrinking pond means more big heads."
"Armed with curved teeth and strong jaws, the big heads feast on the defenseless plankton eaters."
The big heads become so bloated they can barely swim.
But this is gluttony with a purpose.
"As the drought worsens, the pond shrinks."
And the explosive growth of the cannibals pays off.
Skin toughens.
Gills disappear.
Lungs grow.
The bigheads are air-breathing adults.
The tiger salamander walks into number 7 because it turns cannibalism into a sophisticated insurance policy.
But eating each other is a short term survival solution.
"Some animals can go without food for months, or years, or decades!"
NARRATOR:
The Arctic.
One of the harshest environments on Earth.
"In winter, temperatures plunge to -50 degrees."
One animal sleeps in the storm.
The polar bear.
It survives in the frozen wilderness by saving energy.
"The polar bear looks white, but its skin is black and absorbs heat."
There are two layers of fur-- a soft undercoat; and guard hairs up to 6 inches long.
"The fur, coupled with a thick layer of fat, is such an efficient insulator that a bear loses little heat."
"Look through an infrared thermal imaging camera, and a polar bear is almost invisible, appearing little warmer than the frozen land."
"Wrapped in the ultimate survival suit, males spend their lives exposed to the elements."
Pregnant females use a different strategy.
"At the start of winter, they disappear--underground."
"Outside, a male wanders far in search of food."
"Inside, a female travels through time."
She slows her metabolism and sleeps.
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
"They can have visions of the future, or see the dead... ...and sometimes be uniquely susceptible... ...to invasion by an entity that is alien to them."
Objection.
On what grounds?
"How about silliness, Your Honor?"
A young girl suffered terribly and died.
Do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
"Both counselors, please approach the bench."
"Your Honor, this testimony is beyond ridiculous."
Visions...
Supernatural belief systems are shared by millions of people.
We're in *The Twilight Zone* here.
Her expertise is relevant to the issues in this case.
Let's have a witch doctor sift through bones...
Stop.
We've heard a great deal of testimony... ...in support of a medical explanation for Emily's condition.
Now we have a witness who has spent her career... ...studying the defense's alternative explanation.
"An exorcism expert, if you will."
I think we'll hear what she has to say.
"Thank you, Your Honor."
"Dr. Adani, why do you think Emily's exorcism failed?"
The medical treatment.
"Specifically, the drug Gambutrol."
Please explain.
The exorcism ritual results in a specific brain activity... ...that cuts the person off from the possession experience.
But Emily's exorcism could not have achieved this... ...because the doctor gave her Gambutrol... ...which has an intoxicating effect on the brain.
The drug made her immune to the psycho-spiritual shock... ...that exorcism is intended to provide.
What do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
Gambutrol locked Emily in the possessed state.
"This left her unable to respond to the exorcism... ...and therefore, it directly contributed to her death."
"Thank you, doctor."
No further questions.
So we would be having the linear combinations of nine vectors in
"nine-dimensional space, and we would be trying to find the"
combination that hit the correct right-hand side b.
And we might also ask the question can we always do it?
Can we get every right-hand side b?
And certainly it will depend on
those nine columns.
Sometimes the answer will be yes --
"if I picked a random matrix, it would be yes, actually."
"If I used MatLab and just used the random command,"
"picked out a nine by nine matrix, I guarantee it would be good."
It
"would be non-singular, it would be invertible,"
all beautiful.
But if I choose those columns so
"that they're not independent, so that the ninth column is the same"
"as the eighth column, then it contributes nothing new and"
there would be right-hand sides b that I couldn't get.
Can you sort of think about nine vectors in nine-dimensional space an
take their combinations?
That's really the central thought --
that you get kind of used to in linear algebra.
"Even though you can't really visualize it, you sort of think you"
can after a while.
Those nine columns and all their
combinations may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space.
But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth column and
"gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out"
would be -- I hesitate even to say this --
it would be a sort of a plane -- an eight dimensional plane inside
nine-dimensional space.
And it's those eight dimensional
"We have to want until next week to see, but it's, it's kind of clear to many of us that perhaps this larger arrangement, the network, the environment as a network might be greatly influencing the kinds of resource dependencies as well as the kinds of meaning."

Crossing every ocean for the sake of Locomotion

For the sake of Locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul
I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you

I can't even write down my own address
"I can't touch Heaven, it's a little too far"
It's the only way to travel
Got dreaming on a par
I'm staring through the window
Wondering where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour
Across every nation
From the harbor to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state
They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no to you
"I can't stand up, I can't stand still"
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense
"So I'm, I'm limited to what I can show."
So there's certain kinds of regulation over what kinds of information can be shared.
"So, resource dependence varies from a variety of factors."
"There are different types of resources and they can vary in value to their importance and availability, and then certain actors and institutions can control discussion over those resources."
"Now clearly, important rare resources are of greater value."
"More over, actors and institutions that have the greatest disccretion over these resources and the least amount of dependence, will be the most autonomous and capable for forging certain relations with other firms in the environment."

This also gave the Germans to strengthen their defensive positions. By 29 January, there were 69,000 men in the beach. The Germans had 71,500 troops to stop them."
"On 30 January, the Allies attacked, going northeast toward Campoleone and the Alban Hills. A Ranger force tried to sneak into Cisterna."

The Rangers had had many dead and wounded. New troops sent to replace the dead and wounded did not have experience or much training.
Battle.

"Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of OH−, F−, Cl− or ions, respectively, in the crystal."
Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral.
"Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions."
"Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite. In the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate)."

Parts of the speech.
The Memphis Sanitation Strike.
Non-violence.

"King thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated."
Boycotting.
"King suggested boycotting things sold by white businesses as a nonviolent way of protesting and getting people's attention. He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:"
The Civil Rights Movement.

King promises that civil rights activists will not stop until they get their basic human rights.

The Bible in the speech.
King was a Baptist pastor. He often mentioned stories from the Bible in his speeches.
"In the end of this speech, King is talking about a story from the Old Testament. Moses was the leader of the Israelites (the people of Israel). The Israelites followed Moses because they thought he would lead them to a Promised Land. In this Promised Land, they could live in peace."
"However, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says:"
"Soon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land."
"King is saying that like Moses, he has ""been to the mountaintop"" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land."

Royal Thai General System of Transcription
"The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart."

Can't Be Tamed
Can't Be Tamed is the third album made by American singer Miley Cyrus. The album has twelve songs including three singles.
Development and singles.
"""Can't Be Tamed"" is Cyrus's first single. It was released May 18th, 2010. ""Can't Be Tamed"" had good reviews from critics. The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached its highest peak at number five on both the Irish Singles Chart and New Zealand Singles Chart. The music video is Cyrus performing with backup dancers throughout a museum. Cyrus is first trapped in a giant cage, being watched by people in the audience as they were trying to see the rare creature 'Adias Cyrus' she then escapes and trashes the museum. She has promoted ""Can't Be Tamed"" by performing it at several places, including a performance on ""Britain's Got Talent"" and the critics had negative ratings and reviews. The song is also a part of Cyrus' second world tour, Gypsy Heart Tour."
"""Who Owns My Heart"" is Cyrus' second single. It was released on October 22, 2010. Cyrus described it as a ""total dance track"" with a cool idea. Cyrus' ""Who Owns My Heart"" is a club-oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor. The song tries not to proceed to question, ""Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?"" Bill Lamb of About.com thought that, despite its beat, the overall sound of ""Who Owns My Heart"" is faceless and dull. The video starts with Cyrus asleep, blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom. She wakes up and shakes on the mattress. Following, Cyrus goes to a bathroom, her outfit is a white tank top, white boy shorts, a fishnet hair wrap, rollers, and heavy metal jewelry. While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hot pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing on top of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up."
"""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th, 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records released Cyrus' cover in June 2011, and a music video was created and released in 2010."

Succession to the British throne
The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.
"At present the first in line is William, Prince of Wales and then Prince William's son, Prince George of Wales."
"Traditionally, males came before females in the line of succession. However, the law changed on 26 March 2015, so at present, for people born after 28 October 2011 the succession is decided only by age: older children come before younger children. This system of inheritance is called absolute primogeniture, as opposed to male-preference primogeniture. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession."
Excluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.
Line of succession.
"No official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. Any person's actual position in the line of succession may change when people are born or when they die. This list shows only those people who are descended from the sons of George V."

In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Nongthang"" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ, /noŋ.tʰáŋ/) means lightning. The word ""Nongthang"" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ, /noŋ.tʰáŋ/) itself is also made up of two words, ""Nong"" (ꯅꯣꯡ, /noŋ/) and ""Thāng"" (ꯊꯥꯡ, /tʰáŋ/). ""Nong"" (ꯅꯣꯡ, /noŋ/) means rain and ""Thāng"" (ꯊꯥꯡ, /tʰáŋ/) means sword."
"In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Leima"" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) means queen. The word ""Leima"" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) itself is made up of two words ""Lei"" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) and ""Ma"" (ꯃ, /ma/). ""Lei"" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) means land and ""Ma"" (ꯃ, /ma/) means mother."

Mythology.
Birth.
"Sanamahi (Ashiba) was creating the earth. But he was frequently disturbed by his younger brother, Pakhangba (Haraba). Unable to do any work, Sanamahi complained about the matter to their father, Salailen (or Atingkok according to different versions of stories). Salailen produced a divine feminine being. He released her into the great space (void) of the universe (cosmos). In the vast emptiness of the great space (void), the divine feminine being became a beautiful and radiant goddess. She was named ""Nongthang Leima"", the Queen of Lightning."
"In another version of the story, Sidaba ordered Sidabi to produce ""Nongthang Leima"", the divine female being to lure the destroyer from the cosmic creation."
Seduction (Attraction).
"Nongthang Leima, the Queen of Lightning, filled the empty space (void) with bright light. Seeing her, Pakhangba (Haraba) fell in love with her. He forgot about bothering his elder brother in the creation of the earth. Haraba came to her in the great space. During that time, Sanamahi (Ashiba) completed his creation of the earth."
Family.
"When Ashiba (Sanamahi) saw Nongthang Leima, he wanted to marry her. Thus, they united."
"So, Nongthang Leima was the wife of both Sanamahi (Ashiba) and Pakhangba (Haraba)."
"Nongthang Leima is also known as ""Langmai Sana Chingjaroibi"" (). With the union of Chingjaroibi and Sanamahi, a son named Laisang Khekwaiba was born."
Two divine forms.

Scram
"A scram or SCRAM is a quick shutdown of a nuclear reactor. It is done in an emergency (a dangerous situation). A scram is performed by quickly inserting all of the control rods, or, if this fails, injecting boric acid into the reactor.

This has happened during several nuclear accidents, including Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The RBMK reactors used in the Soviet Union had graphite-tipped control rods, a design flaw which caused the reactivity to increase for a moment when the reactor was scrammed. This design flaw contributed to the Chernobyl disaster."

On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again."
"The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps."
"When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence."

History.
The Herald.
"""The Herald"" was started on 3 January 1840 by George Cavanaugh as ""The Port Phillip Herald"". In 1855, it became ""The Melbourne Herald"", but a week later became ""The Herald"". From 1869, it was an evening newspaper. Colonel William Thomas Reay was sometime literary editor and later associate editor, before becoming managing editor in 1904."
The Sun News-Pictorial.
"""The Sun News-Pictorial"" began on 11 September 1922, and bought by The Herald and Weekly Times in 1925."
The merger.
"""The Herald"" once sold almost 600,000 copies, but by the time of its 150th anniversary in 1990 it had fallen below 200,00. This was caused by the impact of evening television news and more people using cars to get home from work.'This was much less than that of the morning ""Sun""."
"As a result, The Herald and Weekly Times decided to merge the two, and so after one hundred and fifty years, ten months and two days of publication, ""The Herald"" was published for the last time as a separate newspaper on 5 October 1990. The next day, ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" published its last edition. The Sunday editions of the two newspapers had already been merged. The resulting newspaper had both the size and style of ""The Sun News-Pictorial""."
"With sales still falling, the afternoon edition was cancelled, the last edition being published on December 21, 2001. The News Limited now produces ""mX"" a free afternoon paper that can be picked up from stands throughout the Melbourne CBD. It is not available outside that area."

Hypoglycemia
"Hypoglycemia is when the level of blood sugar is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally."
"Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke."
"Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications."
"Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose."
"The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough."

Nitro compound
A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group. The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms (-NO2). The nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule.
"Nitrogen normally has only three bonds. In a nitro group, the bond is considered positively charged. Then one bond of the oxygen is negatively charged, and the other has a double bond. In reality, the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons. Then all three atoms are sp2 hybridised."
Reaction.
"Nitro compounds are very explosive. This is because, at high temperature, nitro compounds can decompose and release nitrogen gas. This reaction is very exothermic (gives out a lot of energy). Many explosives have nitro groups, for example trinitrotoluene (TNT)."
Smuggling
"Smuggling means illegal transport of goods, objects substances or information across state, national or international borders. Smugglers do this for various reasons including avoiding tariffs."

Chess notation
"Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves: after a player makes a move, both players write it down. This is compulsory in all organized chess events"
"The system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p275 There are other notations for recording positions."
"There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century).p275 These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; ""The pawn of the king forward two houses"".p229; 469; 848 This kind of notation is called ""descriptive"". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called ""algebraic"". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5."
Algebraic notation.
"The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation.Article 8 and Appendix E Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means ""queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank"" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means ""knight from the g-file moves to the square f3"". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means ""pawn moves to the square ""e4""""."
"If the piece makes a capture, ""x"" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: ""Bxf3"" means ""bishop captures on f3"". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means ""pawn captures on d5."""
"If a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation ""+"" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means ""White won"", 0–1 means ""Black won"" and ½-½ is a draw."
"Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a ""blunder""), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple ""trap"" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:"
"A VIPoma (Pronounced ""V I P oma"") (also called Verner Morrison syndrome after the doctors who first noticed it), is a tumor that does not happen a lot (1 per 10,000,000 per year) in the pancreas. VIPoma makes something called vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP. It can do bad things to the heart, brain, gut, gallbladder, and more."

"The Couesnon, the Sée and the Sélune form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the tide brings lots of sediment. This causes large sandbars within the river. On the other side, the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea."
"In the 20th century, the Couesnon was made into a canal. This to reduced the erosion of its banks. In 1969, a dam was built. These changes, and the causeway linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have made mudflats. The French built a bridge to replace the causeway. It was finished in 2013. This helped to remove the silt."
"During spring tides, a tidal bore — a wave caused by the tide rising — can be seen going up the river."
The Couesnon flows through the following departments and towns:
Hydrology and water quality.

Schwarzschild radius
"The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes erroneously referred to as the gravitational radius), is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties: if all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. An example of an object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is a black hole. Once a stellar remnant collapses below this radius, light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible. It is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass. The ""Schwarzschild radius"" was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916."
This radius can be calculated using the equation:
formula_1
"where the gravitational constant G is N⋅m2/kg2, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light which is 299,792,458 m/s."
Derivation.
"The Schwarzschild radius is found within the Schwarzschild metric, and originally was used to describe the gravitational field around a black hole, given the assumptions that it is spherical, non-rotating, without a magnetic field, and that the cosmological constant is zero; (it describes the path of a particle moving through this spacetime) however, this radius can be calculated for any object."

"The station was built as the terminus of what would become the Hudson Bay Railway in 1908. At first it served by terminating services from the cities in the south. but later destinations were expanded. By 1929 trains were running to Churchill, Thompson, Flin Flon, Lynn Lake, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. By the 1960s all train services were operated by CN. In 1978 Serives were taken over by Via Rail whom at the time operated a total of 18 departures per week out of the station."
The 1978 timetable consisted of:
In 1980 terminating services from Saskatoon were cancelled. Then in 1981 Via received a budget cut which saw tri-weekly services to thompson and to Winnipeg via Swan River discontinued. In 2002 services to Lynn Lake were cut back to Pukatawagan followed by the service being cancelled in 2006 and replaced by a twice weekly mixed use train operated by the local first nations. In 2011 one of the 3 weekly trips to and from Churchill was made to terminate here rather than continue on to Winnipeg. In 2018 flooding saw services to Churchill cut back to Gillam and they weren't restored until over a year later. During the Covid 19 Pandemic terminating services were cancelled and service to Winnipeg and Churchill were retained on a once weekly freequency. This is because the route served vital communites without reliable road access. Service has since reached pre-pandemic levels.

Interquartile range
"In statistics, the interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates how spread out the data are, and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores."
The interquartile range IQR is defined as:
"That is, it is calculated as the range of the middle half of the scores. The scores are divided into four equal parts, separated by the quartiles formula_2 and formula_3, after the scores have been arranged in ascending order (becoming bigger as one goes further). The second quartile formula_4 is also known as the median."
"The interquartile range is not sensitive to outliers (scores that are much higher or much lower than the other scores). In fact, it eliminates them."
Example.
Given the following 20 scores arranged from the smallest to the largest:
We can put them into four different groups of five numbers each:
The groups are thus separated by:
Hence the interquartile range is:
"If the observation 29 has accidentally been written down as 92 instead, then this number is an outlier. Notice that the interquartile range is not affected in that case."

"The group had a wider range of habitats and behaviours than it does at present. ""Dakosaurus andiniensis"", a species closely related to ""Metriorhynchus"", had a skull adapted for eating large marine reptiles. Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory. A number of lines during the Tertiary and Pleistocene became wholly land predators."

Generic drug
"A generic drug is a drug that uses the same active ingredients than another drug, which is already on the market. This second drug often uses a brand name. The German company Bayer developed an analgesic based on acetylsalicylic acid in the late 19th century. It marketed the drug as ""Aspirin"". The drug is no longer under copyright, and anyone can produce a drug with the same active substances, but they may not call that drug Aspirin, because that is a trade name. Very often, such drugs are marketed with the name of the main active substance, and the name of the company producing the drug. In most cases generic drugs are cheaper to buy than the branded alternatives."

Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries
"This article will show the current results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive."
The primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders.
"On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016."

Armenian calendar
"The Armenian calendar was the main calendar used in Armenia during the medieval period. The year in this calendar is exactly 365 days long, divided into twelve months of thirty days each, plus five extra days that are called ""aveleacʿ"" in the Armenian language, which are not a part of any month. The first year in the Armenian calendar is equal to the year 552 AD in the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was mainly used in the medieval era, but is also used in modern times by some Armenian nationalists."

Dodder
"The Dodder, Cuscuta, is a genus of about 100–170 species of parasitic flowering plants."
"Recent genetic research has shown that it is correctly placed in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae."
"The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions. The genus is rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe."
Appearance.
"Dodder can be identified by its thin stems. They look leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales."
"From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are about the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species, such as ""Cuscuta reflexa"", can photosynthesize slightly. Others such as ""C. europaea"" are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition."
"Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are tiny, and produced in large amounts. They have a hard coating, and can survive in the soil for 5–10 years or more."
Life habit.
"Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Germination occurs without a host, but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly. Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants."
"If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons are very small."
Parasitism.
"After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food useful to dodder, the dodder produces 'haustoria' that insert themselves into the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies."
"The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas it can grow continuously, and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees. In temperate climates it is an annual plant, restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring."
"Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias, among others."

Tourism.
Strokkur is famous throughout Iceland and regularly attracts many tourists. People go there to see the geyser erupt.
Sequence of the eruption.
"The water present at a depth of 23 meters has a temperature of about 120 ° C, but cannot transform into a gaseous state due to the high pressure, due to the overlying mass of water. When this water reaches 16 meters deep, a certain amount can reach the boiling point and this induces the chain reaction that we see."
Miquelot de Prades
"Miquel de Prades ( Balaguer ) ? 1462? - Belvedere Marittimo coast 1505), known by the name of Miquelot de Prades, was a Catalan soldier famous for his skill with the sword and various military deeds. There is no certain evidence that confirms whether three documented facts (about a fencer, about a murderer and about a soldier who died at sea) can be attributed to the same person."
Documented facts.
Assassination of Joan Borja in Rome.
"The historian Jerónimo Zurita explains the assassination of Juan de Borja, son of Alexander VI in Rome, in the year 1497. The death was attributed to Michalot de Prats, who was at the service of the victim."
Famous fencer in Italy and Montserrat.
"Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, in his work ""Las Quinquagenas de la nobility de España"", spoke of a Catalan soldier (Michalot de Pradas) who roamed Italy, winning all the duels with a sure thrust to the opponent's neck. Repentant of his life, that soldier went to take refuge in the monastery of Montserrat. One bad day an Italian soldier with two swords showed up and challenged Miquelot (saying that he wanted to see the secret thrust, claiming that he would know how to counter it). Miquelot flatly refused to fight but the other's insistence forced him to do so. The Italian ended up dead, with a thrust to the neck. There was probably no better way to teach it. Repentant of the new death, he went to Rome to ask for forgiveness. The pope incorporated him into his troops."
Soldier at the service of the Pontiff.
"There is a Michalot de Prats who with an armed caravel in Naples chased and made some corsairs flee near Belvedere Marittimo (a priori, without any relationship, with the previous events). Michalot's ship, some ships that accompanied him and the captured privateers suffered a sudden storm and sank (year 1505). All the crew were drowned."

Station facilities.
"Railway stations usually have either ticket booths, or ticket machines. Ticket sales can also be together with an information desk or a shop. Many stations have a shop or a kiosk."
"Bigger stations often have fast-food or restaurants. In some countries these stations also have a bar, or a pub. Other station facilities are: toilets, luggage rooms, lost-and-found (lost property office), timetables, trolleys, waiting rooms, taxi ranks and bus stops."
Railway track
"A railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel. They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another. (In America, people say railroad as well as railway). Often, there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line. For example, trains go east on one track and west on the other one."
"The rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals (called sleepers or ties), which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground. They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart (called the gauge). Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete. These often rest on ballast, which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place. Tracks are often made better by ballast tampers."
"The upper surfaces of the rails are inclined slightly towards each other, typically on a slope of 1/20, and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way (""coning""). This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track. Each wheel also has a flange, which sticks out from one edge all the way around. This makes sure the train does not ""derail"" (come off the track) and helps guide the train on sharp curves."
Rail transport
"Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles called trains, made to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps trade and economic growth. Railways (UK) or railroads (North America) provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads."
Rail transport started to be important in the Industrial Revolution. The first railroads were built in England.
Waterway
"A waterway is any body of water that can be used for transportation by people in boats. These include rivers, lakes, oceans, and canals."
"They must be wide and deep enough for the boats, and either have no waterfalls and rapids, or have ways for boats to get around them, such as locks."

History.
"The first e-book might have been the Index Thonisticus, prepared by Roberto Busa in the late 1940s. However, this is sometimes not called an ebook because the digital text was (at least at first) meant to develop an index and concordance, rather than as a published edition in its own rights."
"Despite the extensive earlier history, it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is Michael S. Hart. In 1971, Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois. Seeking a worthy use of this resource, he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer."
"One early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer, the Dynabook, in the 1970s at PARC: a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading."
"In 1992, Sony launched the Data Discman, an electronic book reader that could read e-books that were stored on CDs. One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future."
"Early e-books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience, meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups. The scope of the subject matter of these e-books included technical manuals for hardware, manufacturing techniques and other subjects. In the 1990s, the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier, including e-books."
"The current eBook standard is the file. There are other proprietary formats like .MOBI, AZW, IBA and PDF."
Church–Turing thesis
"The Church-Turing thesis (also known as Church's thesis, Church's conjecture and Turing's thesis) is a statement about computers. It says that a very simple kind of computer now named a “Turing machine” is able to compute all computable functions. The Church-Turing thesis is linked to Gödel's incompleteness theorems."
"When a programming language is able to do what a Turing machine can do, that language is called Turing complete. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is solvable in all of those."

"When Emperor Ankan died childless, the throne passed to his brother Senka."
Events of Senka's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Senka's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"During this reign, Soga no Iname became the first verifiable ""Great Minister"" or ""Omi"" (also identified as ""Ō-omi"")."
The reign of Emperor Senka lasted for three years.
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Senka.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). Senka is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging
"The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) is a South African political party for the white Afrikaner people, the Boers. It was formed in 1973 by Eugène Terre'Blanche. He led the party until his death in 2010. It is now led by Steyn van Ronge."
"They are a party for the white South Africans who want their own nation. They want to name it ""Boerestaat"". The party is not as extreme as other parties who want to kick out all the black South Africans. The AWB simply wants a state within SA borders."
"The AWB also wants to go back to apartheid, or at least some of them want it. And they want to end the killing of white people by black people. The organisation is not violent, but it used to be back in the 1990s."
"Jamui is a town in Bihar State in India. Its population is 10,51,527 (rural 9,76,960 and Urban 74,567). Subdivisions Jamui consists of 11 Blocks (Jamui, Chakai, Laxmipur, Jhajha, Sono, Khaira, Sikandra, Barhat, Asalmanagar, Aliganj, Gidhaur). Main agriculture are paddy, wheat, lentils. Ganga, Mohane, Harohar, Kiul, rivers flows through this region."
International Braille Chess Association
"The International Braille Chess Association (IBCA) is an organization for blind and visually impaired chess players. The International Braille Chess Association originated unofficially in 1951 with the organization of the first international correspondence chess tournament for blind players, by Reginald Walter Bonham; the tournament included 20 players representing 10 countries. It first organized a tournament in 1958, with representatives from seven countries. Today, it has grown to encompass over 50 member nations around the world.[1] The IBCA hosts two important competitions: the Blind Chess Olympiad and the Blind World Chess Championship."
Rule modifications.
"Although most of the rules in blind chess are consistent with basic chess, there are a few modifications to the equipment to help blind and visually impaired players:"
"After making every move, each player is required to announce their move aloud to their opponent. Instead of writing the moves on a chess score sheet, the visually impaired player writes the moves in Braille or records the moves on a tape recorder."
Padma Shri
"Padma Shri is the fourth highest civilian award of India after Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan awards. These civilian awards are awarded by the Government of India on 26 January, the Republic Day of India each year."
"Padma Shri award was first given in the year 1954. This award is awarded to citizens of India in recognition of their contribution in various activities such as the arts, education, literature, industry, cinema, sports, medicine, social service, public affairs, and others."
Marit Nybakk
"Marit Nybakk (born 14 February 1947) is a Norwegian Labour Party politician. She has been a Member of Parliament for Oslo since 1986. She is the First Vice President of the Norwegian parliament since 2013, and is also the woman who has served the longest time in the parliament during its entire history. She is also President of the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights since 2016."
Padma Vibhushan
Padma Vibhushan is the second highest civilian award of India after the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna. This award was followed by Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri. This award was started to be awarded to the citizens of India since 1954. This award was awarded to the recipients on the Republic Day of India.
"The first recipients to be awarded with Padma Vibhushan are Satyendra Nath Bose, Nand Lal Bose, Zakir Hussain, Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, Jigme Dorji Wangchuk and V.K.Krishna Menon. Vikram Sarabhai became the first person to be awarded Padma Vibhushan posthumously in 1972."
Oberhofen am Thunersee
Oberhofen am Thunersee is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
Oberhünigen
Oberhünigen is a municipality in the administrative district of Bern-Mittelland in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The municipality was made in 1980 by splitting from the municipality of Schlosswil.
Padma Bhushan
Padma Bhushan is the third highest civilian award awarded by Government of India after Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan but before Padma Shri. This award was also awarded in the Republic Day of India.
"Padma Bhushan award was started to be awarded to the citizens of India from 1954. As of 2015, 1230 peoples were awarded with Padma Bhushan. Some citizens refused to get the award.S.Janaki, a renowned singer of the Southern parts of India refused to get the award in 2013 as the honour came to her too late and she also stated that South Indian artists are not recognised."
Oberlangenegg
Oberlangenegg is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.
"Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed region in the South Caucasus. Legally, it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but from 1994 until the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, most of it was militarily controlled by Armenians as the Republic of Artsakh, which is not officially recognized by any other country, including Armenia which supports it. Currently, different parts of the region are controlled by both Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Azerbaijan controlling most of it and Armenia controlling a smaller central area."
Etymology.
"The names for the region in the different local languages all translate to ""mountainous Karabakh"", or ""mountainous black garden"". The word ""nagorno"" is Russian for ""mountainous/on the mountain"", ""kara"" is Turkish for ""black"", and ""bakh"" means ""garden"" in Azerbaijani."
History.
"The region became a subject of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1918 when both states gained brief independence. Two years later, Soviet Union conquered both of the new states and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within Azerbaijan."
"When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in Moscow and started campaigns of publicity and democratic reforms at the end of the 20th century, Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh sent letters to Gorbachev demanding him to move the autonomous oblast to the control of Armenia. When it was declined, the Armenians started an independence movement."
"In November 1991, seeking to stop this movement, the Parliament of Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous status of the region. In response, the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians held a referendum on December 10, 1991, which was boycotted by Azerbaijanis living in Nagorno-Karabakh and none of them participated in it, therefore the overwhelming majority of the population voted for independence."
Newcastle upon Tyne
"Newcastle upon Tyne is a city in north-east England. About 250,000 people live in the city, though more live in the area around it."
Newcastle upon Tyne is called Newcastle for short. It is famous for its big bridge called the Tyne Bridge.
"The local dialect and accent is called the ""Geordie"" dialect. People from Newcastle are also called Geordies. Pronunciation of ""alright"" is ""areet"", ""town"" is ""toon"" and ""house"" is ""hoos""."
James Read
"James Christopher Read (born July 31, 1953) is an American actor. He acted in many movies and television series. He is best known for the ""North and South"" miniseries (1985, 1986, 1994). He was born in Buffalo, New York."
Filmography.
The following is some of the movies and television programms Read has been in.
Satyr play
"Satyr plays were an ancient Greek form of theatre, similar in spirit to burlesque. They featured choruses of satyrs, were based on Greek mythology, and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including phallic props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment."
Premier League
"The Premier League, commonly known as the English Premier League, or the EPL (formerly called the Barclays Premier League due to sponsorship reasons and before 2007 the Premiership) is the top tier of English football. 20 teams compete in the Premier League each season, which is usually played between August and May. Each season, 38 games are played (playing all 19 other teams home and away). For historic reasons, a few clubs from Wales also compete in the English football system."
"The competition started in 1992, after 22 clubs from the Football League First Division decided to break away from The Football League (now the EFL). The Premier League has since become the world's most watched sporting league. It is the world's most lucrative football league, with combined club revenues of £1.93 billion ($3.15bn) in 2007–08. It is also ranked second by UEFA's Association Ranking, behind La Liga."
2022–23 season.
"Twenty clubs will compete in the 2022–23 Premier League, with three promoted from the Championship:"
a: Founding member of the Premier League
b: Never been relegated from Premier League
c: One of the original 12 Football League teams

"An Electro-optic modulator is an optical device. It is made of a material that has a so-called ""electro-optical effect"". This means that the material changes its optical properties when there is an electric field. One example is then when there is no electricity, light can pass through, and when there is, it cannot, and is reflected."
Liquid crystal
"Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid, but that show certain properties of a solid crystal. A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image."
"The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase)."
Liquid crystal displays use the optical properties of liquid crystals to control light.
Turing complete
"Turing complete is a term used in computability theory to describe abstract machines, usually called automata. Such an automaton is Turing complete, if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine. It is also called computationally universal."
"Most modern programming languages are Turing-complete. There are languages that are used to classify and describe the contents of documents; for example HTML. HTML is not Turing complete, because it cannot actively change the state of the system. HTML can be combined with a technology such as JavaScript; both together can be made Turing complete. The standard regular expressions, which most programming languages use, are not Turing complete either. Most regular expression engines have been adapted to include back-references. The problem with this is that a finite automaton cannot handle back references."
River Trent
The River Trent is one of the major rivers of England. It is the third longest river in the United Kingdom. It starts in Staffordshire. It flows through the centre of England until it joins the River Ouse to form the River Humber (estuary) which empties into the North Sea.
"The name ""Trent"" comes from a Celtic word possibly meaning ""strongly flooding"". More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Celtic words, ""tros"" (""over"") and ""hynt"" (""way"")."
"It is unusual amongst English rivers in that it flows north (for the second half of its route), and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore, the ""Aegir"". The area drained by the river includes most of the northern Midlands."
Navigation.
"The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However, for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself."
Trent Aegir.
"At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to high."
Kirkcudbrightshire
Kirkcudbrightshire is a Scottish county on the Solway Firth in the south-west of Scotland.
Its county town is Kirkcudbright.
"Kirkcudbrightshire was known by other names in the past: East Galloway because it is the eastern part of the old Kingdom of Galloway, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, because it was once governed by a steward employed by the Lord of Galloway and not a sheriff appointed by the king."
"Kirkcudbrightshire is named after the town of Kirkcudbright, which means ""Cuthbert's church""."
Villages.
"For local government, the county is in the Dumfries and Galloway council area."
Kirkcudbright
"Kirkcudbright is the county town of Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland."

Edie Falco
"Edie Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American movie, television and stage actress. She plays Carmela in HBO's ""The Sopranos"". She starred in ""Nurse Jackie"" as the title character. She also acted in many movies."
Cymbeline
"The Tragedy of Cymbeline is a play by William Shakespeare. It is based on a story in a book called ""Holinshed's Chronicles"" by Raphael Holinshed. Shakespeare also used ""History of the Kings of Britain"" by Geoffrey of Monmouth about the real-life British king Cunobelinus. Shakespeare also used a story in a book by Giovanni Boccaccio called ""Decameron"" for some details. The first known performance was in April 1611. It was first printed in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays."
Systems engineering
"Systems engineering is a field of engineering that deals with complex engineering projects which should be designed and managed over the life cycle of the project. Therefore, issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become really complicated. Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to handle such projects. For this, it applies both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management."
Leigh Francis
"Leigh Francis (born 30 April 1973) is an English comedy performer best known for his portrayal of foreign celebrity-obsessed character Avid Merrion in Channel 4 comedy programme ""Bo' Selecta!"", as well as Northern businessman Keith Lemon in ""Keith Lemon's Very Brilliant World Tour"" and ""Celebrity Juice"". As Keith Lemon, he has also made many appearances on ""Big Brother's"" companion shows ""Big Brother's Little Brother"" and ""Big Brother's Big Mouth""."
Hurricane Flora
"Hurricane Flora was among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes. This hurricane happened in Autumn 1963. The storm hit southwestern Haiti at peak intensity (her winds peaked at 145 miles per hour). Flora then drifted over Cuba for almost four days before heading northeast into the Atlantic. Between seven thousand and eight thousand people died due to Flora. At that time, the death toll was the most from any storm since the Galveston Hurricane in September 1900. The name Flora was later retired."
Dance-pop
"Dance-pop is a genre of pop music that originated in the 1980s and is still popular nowadays. It incorporates elements of normal pop music, and it is (usually) fast-paced and upbeat. This is a common genre for many artists, including Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Rihanna, Kesha, Britney Spears, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and Katy Perry."
Electropop
"Electropop (also called technopop) is a musical genre in which electronic music and pop music are combined together. The genre has been popular since the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. ""Electropop"" is the short form of ""electronic pop""."
Doc Walker
"Doc Walker is a country music band from Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada, which is near Winnipeg. Band members are Murray Pulver - guitars and vocals, Chris Thorsteinson - lead vocals and guitars, Dave Wasyliw - vocals and guitars. They have been together since the band formed in 1995, have been called ""the hardest working country band in Canada""."
"They have had several Top 10 songs on the charts. Hits include ""Beautiful Life"", ""From Here"", and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"". Other great songs are ""That Train"", ""North Dakota Boy"", ""Rocket Girl"", ""Driving With the Breaks On"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Whoever Made Those Rules""."
"“Simplicity is the best hook sometimes,” -Chris Thorsteinson."
Mechatronics engineering
"Mechatronics (or mechatronic engineering) is a combination of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, computer engineering, control engineering, and systems-design engineering in order to design and manufacture some useful products. Mechatronics is an engineering system design that combines several areas of study and avoids splitting engineering into separate disciplines."
Tree of life (biology)
The tree of life is a metaphor which expresses the idea that all life is related by common descent.
Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in modern biology. It had been used many times before for other purposes.
"A full twisting layout is a gymnastics tumble. The move is essentially a somersault but involves a full twist in the air. It can be performed tucked, piked or straight."
Master of Public Administration
"Master of Public Administration (usually abbreviated MPA) is a postgraduate academic master's degree given by universities. Usually, it is awarded for studies toward Administration in the Public sector and Non-profit organizations. Usually, Public policy is part of the study. Additionally, there may be studies of comparisons between countries."
It is usually required to start a doctorate in Public Administration.
Tanzanite
"Tanzanite is a blue-purple gemstone found in Tanzania, in the Mererani Hills near the city of Arusha and Mount Kilimanjaro. It is named after the country of Tanzania, where it is found. It is a kind of a mineral called zoisite. When it is first mined, tanzanite is usually a red-brown colour. It needs to be heated to 600 degrees Celsius in a special oven to bring out its purple colour."
Elephant shrew
"The elephant shrew, also called sengi, are any of 16 species of rat-sized African mammals named for their long, tapered, and flexible snout (proboscis). All have slim bodies, slender limbs, and very long hind legs and feet. Although they resemble shrews, they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order Macroscelidea. Long thought to be related to shrews, they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews although this was not known or even widely believed until the 1990s."
Description.
"Elephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day. Their ears and eyes are large, and, when alarmed, they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain, sometimes leaping over obstacles. When foraging, they move along the pathways, using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey, which consists of small insects (especially ants and termites), other arthropods, and earthworms. Gestation lasts two months, and litters contain one or two well-developed young."
Hyrax
"Hyrax also called dassie is any of four species of thick, herbivorous mammals in the order Hyracoidea, any of six species of small hoofed mammal (ungulates) native to Africa and extreme southwestern Asia."
"Hyraxes are well-furred rotund creatures with a short tail. Most measure between 30–70 cm long and weigh between 2–5 kg. Hyraxes are mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is possible that the Hebrew word for hyrax (""shafan"") is the source of the name of present-day Spain. Even though hyraxes are not native to Spain, rabbits are, and the theory states that early Hebrew explorers considered the rabbits to be a variety of hyrax."
Transposition
Transposition means to change places. It is a technical term in several disciplines:
Reto Von Arx
"Reto von Arx (born 13 September, 1976 in Egerkingen, Switzerland) is a Swiss professional ice hockey left winger that currently plays for the HC Davos of the Swiss National League A. von Arx also played in the NHL for 1 season with the Chicago Blackhawks and also for their farm team at the time, the Norfolk Admirals. He was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks with the 271st overall pick in the 2000 NHL Draft."
René Bourque
"René Gary Wayne Bourque (born December 10, 1981 in Lac La Biche, Alberta) is a former Canadian ice hockey left winger. He played in the NHL for the Chicago Blackhawks, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadiens, and Columbus Blue Jackets."
Absorption
"Absorption is when something takes in another substance. It is a physical or chemical phenomenon or process. Atoms, molecules, or ions enter in the inner part (called ""bulk"") of a gas, liquid, or solid material."
"This is different from adsorption. Molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the volume of the material, instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the surface of the material. A more general term is ""sorption"", which covers absorption, adsorption, and ion exchange."
"Other meanings of ""absorption"" are:"
formula_3
"Where formula_4 is the operator of formula_5 and formula_6. This law also gives rise to an uncertainty between energy and time, which can be expressed in the same way as the relation between momentum and position."
Probability waves.
"Another important fact of quantum mechanics is that the electron behaves in a very weird way. At first, no one really knew what the wavefunction meant physically. Max Born, a theoretical physicist, explained that the wavefunction is a ""probability wave."" In other words, wherever the wave is denser, that is where the particle is most likely found, but it won't necessarily be found there. The way to find the probability"
(formula_7) of the position of the particle in the region formula_8
"For example, if formula_7 is equal to .5, then there is a 50% chance of finding the particle within that region. This shows us that the location of a particle is probabilistic; one can never say that the particle will ""definitely"" be found at a certain point in space, but rather, one can only give the probability of finding the particle within that region."
Copenhagen interpretation.
"The most well-accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics and the most boring one is the idea called Copenhagen interpretation. This interpretation builds upon the probability-wave notion, but brings in a radical new idea called the superposition principle. The best way to explain this principle is by showing it mathematically. If the functions formula_10 are solutions of the Schrödinger equation, then the superposition of those wavefunctions is also a solution. i.e.,"
formula_11
"Where formula_12 is the superposition of the various wavefunctions. This idea implies that a particle occupies every possible wavefunction it can. This implies that a particle occupies more than one position ""at the same time."" In other words, a particle exists in at least two different positions simultaneously. When an observer comes and actually measures the position of the particle, something called the wavefunction collapse occurs. So when someone observes the particle, the following happens:"
formula_13→formula_14
"In simple terms: when there is no observation or observer, then a particle occupies many positions simultaneously; when an observation takes place, the wavefunction collapses and the particle exists only in one position."
Many-worlds interpretation.
"The many-worlds interpretation is by far the most fantastic interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation says that rather than the wavefunction collapsing, each possibility actually occurs, but in separate universes. This means that the universes branch off for each possibility. Also it says that you can live forever according to quantum suicide."
Quantum determinism.
"The interpretation presented by Albert Einstein himself, states that the outcome of some random event is predetermined. So, rather than a particle existing as a probability wave, this interpretation says that the particle exists only in one position, but we just perceive it to be a probability. This idea is much less popular, but nonetheless mentionable."
Which one is right?
"So, of the three main interpretations of quantum mechanics, which one is correct? Physicists seem to think that the Copenhagen interpretation is the most likely, but no one is for sure."
Planck's law
"Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature ""T"". The law is named after Max Planck, who proposed it in 1900. It is a pioneering result of modern physics and quantum theory."
"Kure, Hiroshima"
is a Japanese city in Hiroshima Prefecture on the island of Honshu.
History.
"In 1894, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi transfered the Imperial Headquarters (""Daihon'ei"") to Kure."
The modern city of Kure was founded in 1902.
The natural harbor was a naval base until the end of the Second World War. The Japanese battleship Yamato was built at Kure.
"Etajima, Hiroshima"
is a Japanese city in Hiroshima Prefecture on the Etajima Island at the entrance of the bay of Hiroshima.
History.
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
that's interesting.
"Yeah,"
"the only pet that I've had, uh,"
"I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now"
Uh-huh.
"and in my, in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine"
"and, uh, it was an amazing dog,"
it really was.
"They had, he had gotten it from the pound"
"and, uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a a Dalmatian"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
"and we trained it from a pup,"
"and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained"
and it can do a lot of things.
"It will get beer for you out of the fridge,"
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.
"So, it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece"
"and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know ."
"Oh, I think so."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh,"
"she's been a real good, a real good dog"
"and, uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm I'm away from it now."
"I, I I actually live in Florida"
Uh-huh
but I'm on an internship up here for a year
"and then I go back down,"
"but, uh,"
"yeah,"
Domino's a real good dog.
Yeah.
"Well, we've just, uh,"
"it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something"
"and, uh, it was,  never convenient to have anything."
Yeah.
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
Yeah.
"Uh, someplace where there, you know,"
we can take care of it and everything.
"We've got,  some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know, a dog, I think"
Yeah.
"and, What about you all?"
Yeah.
"Well, right now I'm a student,"
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
"Oh, no."
"No,"
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
Is that right?
Yeah.
They're very strict about it.
"But you like, uh, you like pets and things?"
"Oh, I love animals."
"Oh, yeah ."
"I was raised,"
"our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house."
Uh-huh.
"It was almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, uh, always cats in the house."
"Oh, yeah."
"We, we,  enjoyed them."
Oh.
"We like, we like pets,"
"but, uh, you know, you've got to deal with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that."
"and, and, when you turn, When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it"
"And then, at a took that away as far as being,"
and the tax is a lot less.
Yeah.
"But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low, relatively low interest bearing investment."
"I mean, it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today."
Huh-uh.
"Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it."
"Well, you can come over to my house and spend it"
"Well, you, well, do you, do you need some help spending yours?"
I wish I had some to spend.
No.
No.
I just don't have any.
"Oh, uh-huh."
"Well, that's my problem too."
"I'm, I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid."
Yeah.
That's the way it goes
"Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, let me ask you something."
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?
Yes.
You did?
Uh-huh.
"I've, everybody I've talked to has received one"
but I haven't gotten mine.
"Uh, I don't know."
"Um, well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you."
You too.
"I mean, it's, it's,"
"and so I'm going, I'm so old"
"and I'm, I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young."
"No,"
"you're extremely,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's"
"And, you know, so it's,"
"Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption"
"and I have friends that say well why would you do that,  if you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know, why would you do that now, at this part, point,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, um, it's just individual choices."
Yeah.
"I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um,"
"in my family my brother's children,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, he just turned forty,"
his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five.
Wow.
"Um, I mean that's like your mother,"
"look how young she is,  compared to where you are out of school and everything."
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Right.
"It's just, it,"
"but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble."
It's all independent and choices.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
very true.
"Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably just won't say it,"
"But, um, what I do do, and I've always done it is,"
"at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens."
"I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre."
Uh-huh.
So we each have a third of an acre we do.
"Jeez,"
"that's more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, uh, garden,"
That's a lot
that's amazing.
"Yeah,"
"well, it's my dad's,"
and we've had it for he's been there for a long time
Right.
"so, um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it"
"Oh, jeez."
"but, um, they put up a nice fence,"
"so we still have a lot of privacy,"
and we grow a lot of food.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I enjoy it,"
"um, the gardens are kind of old,"
"you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much,"
Uh-huh.
"but there's still,"
"we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer."
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
"But I wish this phone would stop screeching,"
Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?
Yes.
"I'm trying,"
I don't know if it's my phone.
This is bad.
you could probably do that.
"Or is it,"
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
Yeah
"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
that's tough.
"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
Not even a half bath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
And that was even just with two people.
That was a pain.
"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
That's good.
Really.
That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
No.
That's right.
It does not make for a happy situation.
That's true.
"Well, do you have any children?"
I've got one.
One child.
And they enjoy where they're living?
"We'll,"
he's nine months old.
"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
"I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,"
"but before that, I really, there's not much time."
Right.
Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
"Right,"
"well, our,"
"yeah,"
"if our if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that."
We don't watch it unless they're here
Uh-huh.
"No,"
I like that.
"No,"
"I'll watch, game show kind of stuff"
"But they, uh,"
"but, Yeah."
"It's, it's, um, oh,"
"and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."
We've wound up sending in one.
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
Did you send one?
Yeah.
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.
"He's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,"
How funny.
"and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,"
"and he bit into it,"
and it was just hanging by a thread.
"And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,"
"and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it."
"And he he wound up pull,"
So do you have P C
"And, uh, then she could be at home"
and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
"But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour"
"and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents"
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
"Oh, no."
Yeah.
It's hardly worth your time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty bad.
The only time I baby-sat was in high school
"and it, you know,"
of course you don't
"I didn't pay taxes on that,"
so.
Right.
"It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,"
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and I'd just go over there.
"Every Thursday night, they went to the theater."
They had permanent tickets
"and they'd give me,"
"it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,"
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
"Oh, wow."
"And, I mean, they'd, you know,"
it was great.
I'd go over there
"and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here."
"Watch, whatever you want."
"And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard."
"I would, that's ideally the where, where I would like to be."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"and like I said, once, once it, it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due,"
"and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, yeah,"
I didn't like it at all.
I was very uncomfortable.
"So,"
I can imagine.
"You know, and, and I mean, it was, I thought a lot,"
"sixty dollars interest or something for, for just a couple of months,"
"and I'm going jeez, that's outrageous,"
Yeah.
"but in, in, you know, retrospect it wasn't all that much,"
I mean a lot of people pay a lot more
"and and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.
Exactly
Groceries for a week.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"I, I think about all, all the money that, that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards,"
Uh-huh.
and it's just incredible.
But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.
I guess you would consider that a home repair.
Huh-uh.
"Certainly, uh, uh,"
"and interesting enough, this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition."
"What is your most recent,"
"We just did that, too."
"You did that recently too, uh,?"
Yes.
Does it make a big difference?
"Oh, yes"
we have brick on the outside
"and, uh, the colors that were there changed the, and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house."
Huh-uh.
Completely.
That's neat isn't it.
Yeah.
That was really exciting.
It was fun.
"I was really, really tired of the color."
"That it's, it's helping."
"We're not quite through,"
"but it's, it really is looking good."
"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had,"
"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do."
"Um, we didn't have very much money"
"and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,"
"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual."
Huh-uh.
So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, we did that a different color also."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
"Well, we have a lot that needs be done."
"We have, uh, uh, carpeting,"
"and, and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen."
"And, um, I have my mother living with us"
and so she was in a room with a carpet
"and, of course, she's quite aged,"
"she's ninety-three now,"
so that meant she had problems now and then
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.
So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
"and  so that was a really positive, uh, uh,"
Huh-uh.
it was fairly expensive though.
"I, I was impressed,"
"I think, that, uh,"
we had somebody do it
"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet."
Huh-uh.
"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor"
"so it's, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"what ever,"
but they have to put stuff on the floor
"and it's, uh, kind of a process."
"Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair."
Huh-uh.
We have.
It's been really fun.
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know,"
"you just switch that thing on,"
"and, uh,"
"Yeah,"
that's true.
Yeah.
"But, you know, people,"
"it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day,"
"and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man"
"Um, even in an office?"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also,"
"as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York,"
"and, uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or stock investments  or whatever."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
right.
And now I'm getting the same calls at at the house.
"Uh-huh,"
I know.
"And they get your, and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet,"
"and, uh, credit card companies, they sell your name."
"Oh, yeah,"
"uh, well, you know, these people, they sell your names,"
I mean
I know.  Yes.
"you know, I,"
that's also an invasion of privacy.
"I think it the whole thing is, uh,"
"And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and we like pets."
We like them around.
We have grandchildren that run through
"and they think we should have a dog,"
and that's because they have a Great Dane
Huh.
Yes.
They're just huge
Definitely.
"Well, we, you know,"
"if it, um, if it were just more peaceful, you know, with the little ones, we would definitely have a pet."
I just think it's nice to have around.
We had a cat that had kittens.
So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered.
"Oh, yes,"
yes.
"Because, uh, I did."
That experience was awful
"Yes,"
"I have never wanted to,"
"that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, uh, neutered right away,"
to baby very what you doing ?
"and, of course, it, he doesn't know it."
He's still out partying.
Oh.
"But, um, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, you know."
"And, uh,"
"Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying."
Uh-huh.
And we have the things that are extras.
But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
Yeah.
"And, well, you know, the auto budget,"
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
Uh-huh.
"And insurance,"
is insurance bad there?
"Um, I've got, uh, two older cars."
"There both,"
one's a seventy-seven
and one's a seventy-eight.
"Well, we've got one eighty-nine."
"And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year."
"But when I moved to the new town I live in,"
"because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways"
"and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned,"
"so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year."
Wow.
"That's not bad,"
four hundred and something a year.
"That's, that's,"
It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
That's cheaper than we pay.
"Yeah,"
"I was down in Texas for two years,"
"and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance. Um,"
"Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault."
Yeah.
Do you have that there?
they have no fault in Maryland also.
"Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room,"
but our cat would sleep with us
and he hated that.
Did he?
Uh-huh.
"He just thought that they belong,"
and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that.
Uh-huh.
"So, I guess it's probably, probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats."
"I think it would probably be a dog,"
and it would definitely be an outdoor animal.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I think that's one of the reasons our,"
"because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old."
And so he was becoming incontinent.
"And so then I would just have messes in the house,"
"and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, you know."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, and it was new carpeting"
"and, you know, it just really, you know, upset me no end."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that would, Greg, uh,"
my husband's grandparents have a dog
"and they just,"
it needs to be put to sleep
"but it's grandpa's dog,"
"and, uh, he's really getting too old to take care of it."
But the dog messes all over the carpet
and my daughter is just nine months old
"You can play with your friends,"
"he can play with his friends,"
"but you've both been out and exercised,"
and you have enjoyed the day.
"Right,"
yeah.
"Or my favorite,"
just ride around in the cart with him
"You bet,"
you get a lot of exercise that way.
"Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just look at the golf course."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, I'll tell you what, if if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long."
"Oh, yeah."
"But my husband's pretty tolerant,"
so he's not too bad to watch.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, mine had a very short fuse."
"If he did something bad, he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it."
"Oh, no,"
yeah.
He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.
"I mean, just get so mad, he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal."
Gosh.
"Now my husband has a temper,"
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.
"He's, because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature he thought it was and stuff."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
So I guess he's real laid back about it.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here"
"Oh, if you had it early."
but usually it's not until later
It's really strange.
"Yeah,"
I think we usually have a frost in October.
Yeah.
"Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting,"
"and it has not today,"
"but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day."
"Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?"
Flooding anywhere.
"I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere,"
"I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past,"
"but, uh, no,"
I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
"It's just kind of, uh,"
"we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange."
We haven't really had an autumn.
It's like we went into winter
Yes.
"you know, the poor trees, said what"
"Yes,"
"yeah,"
we had summer lasting long
"and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day."
"Yeah,"
"uh, it's,"
"Yeah,"
"there, you, you know,"
"usually there's, uh,"
we got that.
Okay.
Pretax insurance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But we call it the cafeteria plan,"
I wonder why.
Um?
"I said, I wonder why."
"Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it."
Cafeteria?
Yeah.
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it
Maybe
so. Let's see what else can we do?
"Changes,"
I'll tell you what we could do.
What?
"We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired"
Uh-huh.
"Because you know,"
"You mean, like for health insurance?"
"Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company."
"See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out."
"Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching."
"Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid."
Thank you
What?
"I said, thank you."
"if you're cutting,"
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for for set up?
"Uh, tools for set up and for measurement."
"Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,"
"it's a hundred dollars. Uh,"
"five tenths uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. Uh,"
Huh.
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.
"You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars."
"You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,"
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.
A two to three for eighty dollars.
A three to four for eighty dollars.
So you've got thousands of dollars or so.
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.
Real fast.
Yes.
"Real, real fast."
Edge finders and ...
"But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ..."
"Well, I know,"
"because, okay."
Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.
Yeah.
You know.
"But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,"
I need a hole there.
What size hole?
Yeah.
"As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?"
Yeah.
"And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws"
"and, uh, if I catch him I call him"
and he comes back.
"So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things."
Um.
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
No
we never did.
"and,"
"I, I trained him on my own"
"and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult."
Uh-huh.
"We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,"
"but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,"
"so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,"
"but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well."
I never really to hit him or anything.
Uh-huh.
"Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things."
Huh.
Really?
"I, I see other people out there"
"and they hit their dogs and try to,"
"and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,"
"least I,"
Invisible what?
"Invisible fencing,"
have you heard of that?
"No,"
what is that?
"It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter"
Oh.
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
one paycheck went into savings
"and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills"
Right.
"and it,"
"and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty"
"and, you know. But my wife likes to spend."
"She enjoys,"
so that's fine
But a
"for savings , I'll have to look into that."
Yeah.
"that's, that's been our godsend, you know."
Huh-uh.
"We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,"
"we also own our own house,"
Huh-uh.
"um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible."
Yeah.
"I mean, half the city owned trees ."
One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.
"Oh, really, because of the heavy ice."
Yeah.
It broke the limbs.
Exactly.
Huh-uh.
"We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,"
"but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken."
Right.
"Plus, we went with a friend,"
"and they said you know,"
"and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it."
Yeah.
Especially if you need a tune-up.
Uh-huh.
"They kept saying that the that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters."
"Yeah,"
"well, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
and it starts up
Yeah.
"and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time."
Uh-huh.
"See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years."
Right.
They all take the exact same starter.
They'll interchange completely.
I mean completely.
One starter will fit all of them.
"So they've got a whole lot of torque,"
"but to do that, they did it,"
"use an underdrive system,"
"but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long,"
Uh-huh.
it's kind of tough on the bushings.
Yeah.
Usually what goes is the bushings.
Right.
"You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter."
"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with with good enough bushings."
Uh-huh.
"So it's, you know,"
"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up."
Yeah.
"Anyway, what are you driving now?"
"Uh, my Chrysler van"
"Kemp graduated from Centennial High School in Franklin, Tennessee. He attended Vanderbilt University, where he played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team. In 2011, Kemp was named the Southeastern Conference's (SEC) Freshman of the Year and First Team All-SEC. He was a key contributor on the first Vanderbilt baseball team to make it to the College World Series. In 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was named an All-American and the SEC Baseball Player of the Year in 2013."
"The Astros selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game."
"Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After former Astros center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, it was said that Kemp and Jake Marisnick would be splitting duties in centerfield."
"On March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list."
"On September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp had a .216 average and 4 RBI. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title."
"In March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick. In the 2018 season, Kemp played in 97 games for the Astros, batting .263/.351/.392 with 6 HR and 30 RBI, playing primarily in left field. He was mocked by the Fenway Park crowd and organist during the second game of the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS) when he took an extended period of time to return to the batter's box after a foul ball. Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first.

"KZOO has been broadcasting continuously in Japanese since the station signed on October 18, 1963. It was not the first Japanese-language station in Honolulu (competitor KOHO/1170 signed on in 1959), but it is the only one still on the air today."
"The station has been owned by Polynesian Broadcasting since 1967, when businessman Noboru Furuya took over KZOO's operations. Furuya's son David and his wife Robyn took over management of the station in the mid-1990s when Furuya's health began to decline. Noboru Furuya died in 2002 at the age of 82; David and Robyn Furuya (now the president and vice-president, respectively, of Polynesian Broadcasting) continue to run KZOO today."
"Though most of their programs are broadcast from their offices at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii, in 2011 KZOO began broadcasting special interviews from a studio in the Shirokiya in Ala Moana Shopping Center."
"KZOO's programs include news, talk shows, and Japanese music. Most of it is original programming, but some of the talk shows are from Japan."
"Many of KZOO's current on-air staff have been with the station for decades, including Keiko Ura, host of an Okinawan language show on Sundays, who joined the station in early 1964; Maki Norris, one of the hosts of a popular daily talk show called ""Moshi-Moshi Time,"" who has worked at KZOO since 1976; and Harumi ""Danny"" Oshita."
"KZOO has a history of sponsoring Japanese speech (""Nihongo Hanashikata Taikai"", started by announcer Keiko Ura in 1965) and nodojiman and karaoke song contests in Honolulu, with winners going on to represent Hawaii at contests in Japan. The station's broadcast day also includes simulcasts of programs from Japan as well as local talk and advice shows on a variety of topics, from health to the law."
"When KZOO was knocked off the air by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, the station's assistant general manager, Kaoru Ekimoto, contacted English-language adult contemporary music station KSSK, who put her on the air with disaster relief information in Japanese; the station also set up a hotline to answer listener questions. The station later added a backup generator for its transmitter."
= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

"All Saints' Church, Narborough is a parish church in the Church of England in Narborough, Leicestershire."
"The current church in Narborough dates from the 13th century, although it is highly probable an even earlier church dating back to the 10th century or before stood on or near the site. A Saxon hogback tombstone was found near the church and is on display at the Jewry Wall Museum in Leicester."
"The church was largely rebuilt in 1856-1883. There are two aisles, nave, chancel and north vestry with a west tower containing a ring of six bells. The large nave of six bays has fine piers and strong shafts. The chancel was rebuilt in 1883 by F. Bacon. There is also an Ascension window by Theodora Salusbury from 1929 (Carlton church has another fine window by the artist) in the north aisle. The stained window has two fish hidden in the folds of the robes. The ornate reredos behind the altar is very fine as is the whole of the chancel area."
The church includes a number of memorials/windows to the Everard family.
"The original Norman south porch was rebuilt in 1860 at a cost of £60. The font which has moved three times dates from the 13th century, and has tracery panels of various kinds including one with two parallel tree trunks. There are also sedilia in the southern aisle and a piscina. The graveyard is closed to burials now as these have transferred to the cemetery next door. In the actual churchyard there is a gravestone to a Harry Baker who died aged 49 in 1901 after being ""thrown from a trap""."
"The parish is part of the benefice of Narborough and Huncote, within the Diocese of Leicester. The church has weekly Sunday services and other events, including a yearly Christmas Tree Festival. The church is normally locked, but regular events and open days are held."
All Saints' Church itself is a Grade II* listed building.
"= = = All Saints' Church, Normanton = = ="
"All Saints' Church is the parish church in Normanton, West Yorkshire, England."
"The current church is believed to have existed since at least 1256, and thought to have been commissioned by Roger Le Peytevin of Altofts Hall. However, a prior church is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is likely that the current church stands on the lines of the original."
"In 1256, Le Peytevin, a Norman Baron, granted the church to the Hospital of St. John, of the Knights Hospitallers, at Newland."
"The building is in the perpendicular style, being built mainly of coursed dressed sandstone blocks under a stone slate roof and consists of a three-bay chancel with a south chapel adjacent, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles and a clerestory. A tower was added to the western end in the 15th century. In the 19th century, clergy and choir vestries were added as well as an organ chamber. The building was granted Grade II* listing in 1965. The church was internally re-ordered in 1991 and again in 2019. The latest re-ordering has returned the church to an east-facing orientation."
"The church houses the Freeston Tomb, the burial place of Sir John Freeston of Altofts (d 1594), who by his will provided for an almshouse at Kirkthorpe and a grammar school for Normanton and Warmfield. His benefice still provides funding for the current secondary school in Normanton, the Freeston Business and Enterprise College."
"In 1906, a medieval altar slab bearing five incised crosses was found under the sanctuary floor, where it had probably lain since the reformation. It now stands in the Lady Chapel and is used for weekly Eucharist."
"There is low octagonal stone Font, now standing at the west end of the nave."
"The window at the east end of the Lady Chapel depicting the fall of the Walls of Jericho, is a war memorial to the fallen of the Great War."
"The window to the left of the porch was an addition in the late 1970s as a memorial to the explorer, Martin Frobisher of nearby Altofts."
"All Saints' possesses two ancient silver cups, now housed in a collection at York Minster. The oldest was made in London in 1655 and is inscribed ""Normanton cupp 1674"". The second is two-handled porringer inscribed ""The Gift of Mrs Henry Favell of Pontefract to the Church of Normanton for ever 1699"""
"In ""Normanton, Past and Present,"" author Walter Hampson (1928) noted the monuments within the church: ""The chapel is the burial place of the Bunnys of Newland, Torres of Snydale, Favells of Normanton, Smiths (now Bosworths) late of Newland and the Mallets and Levetts of Normanton. The Favells were an important Normanton family and were resident here in the early part of the 17th century. On the south chancel floor are memorial slabs of the Favells bearing the dates 1698, 1714, 1777 and others in the 18th century. Here also is a large altar tomb of the Malletts and Levetts. The Mallets it would seem were a very ancient family, as we are told their ancestors flourished here in the middle of the 13th century. The tomb on the top bears the arms of the Levetts together with the arms of the Mallets. On the wall above the tomb is an undated tablet recording that 'Mrs. Elizabeth Levett made benefaction for the poor of Normanton and Snydale, and for teaching poor children.' There also are tombs of the Torres mentioned under Snydale."""
"The Mallets and the Levetts had lived in Normanton for centuries. (The first High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1069 was William Malet; Speaker of the House of Commons, and High Sheriff of Yorkshire Sir Thomas Gargrave had married Elizabeth, daughter of William Levett of Normanton)."
"There are several monuments in All Saints' Church to the Yorkshire antiquarian James Torre, who having graduated from the Inner Temple in London gave up the law, sold his properties and retired to do historical research at York, later purchasing the manor of Snydale. Torre died in 1699."

Ambition is the perfect word for where I am in my life right now."" When it came around to Sparks' creating her new scent she was more focused on what to leave out.

"The Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (often shortened to BBC) was a Philippine television network that began operations on November 4, 1973 and ceased transmission on March 20, 1986."
"DWWX-TV (formerly DZAQ-TV) station owned by ABS-CBN was shut down following the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, and served as the flagship station of BBC. Roberto Benedicto, a crony of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and owner of the Kanlaon Broadcasting System, took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex on Bohol (now Sergeant Esguerra) Avenue in Quezon City after the KBS Studios along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City (which were ironically sold to them by ABS-CBN in 1969) were destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973, a few months before BBC went on air. The new network was named the ""Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation"" after Mount Banahaw, a dormant volcano located in southern Luzon known for its hot springs and mystical associations."
"In July 1978, BBC, RPN and another Benedicto-owned network, the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) (which originally aired from San Juan del Monte), transferred to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City, with the transmitter located along Panay Avenue, Quezon City (now being used by ABS-CBN), with the then newly upgraded 35 kW transmitter for better broadcast reception. This left Channel 4 (a frequency formerly owned by ABS-CBN and taken over by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC) as Government Television in 1974) at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center complex, then renamed MBS Broadcast Plaza (MBS being Maharlika Broadcasting System, the name that Channel 4 acquired in 1980)."
"By December 1973, the network also operated DYCB-TV 3 in Cebu and DYXL-TV 4 in Bacolod, both of which were also originally owned by ABS-CBN. Their call signs were also changed to DYCW-TV and DYBW-TV, respectively. The Cebu and Bacolod stations switched affiliations to GTV (Government Television; later the Maharlika Broadcasting System) in 1978 and reverted to their former call letters."
"BBC-2 was rebranded as City 2 Television from 1980 until 1984. In 1984, it was rebranded again back as BBC-2 (not to be confused with the British television channel). BBC ended operations on March 20, 1986 after People Power Revolution along with RPN and IBC (temporarily), after reformist soldiers disabled the transmitter that was broadcasting Marcos' inauguration from Malacañang Palace. Upon Corazón C. Aquino's subsequent accession to the presidency, BBC, RPN and IBC (collectively known as ""Broadcast City"") were sequestered and placed under the management of a Board of Administrators tasked to operate and manage its business and affairs subject to the control and supervision of Presidential Commission on Good Government. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on September 14, 1986 and its Cebu and Bacolod stations were returned to its original owner. DWWX-TV is still used as the callsign of the network's flagship station in Metro Manila."
"BBC became well-remembered for its trademark jingle, ""Big Beautiful Country"", composed by José Mari Chan and sung by various OPM singers of the 70s. By 1980, its relaunch as City 2 made history as the first national station to incorporate computer-generated graphics using the Scanimate system for its station identity and promo spots, followed only by Radio Philippines Network in 1981-82."

The motto of the paper in those early days was, ""Good Roads, Flowers, Parks, Better Schools, Trees, Pure Water, Fresh Air and Sunshine for Somebody and Work for Somebody."""
"In the early 1960s another paper -- ""The Newark Weekly"" -- was founded by Reginald B. ""Rocky"" Rockwell and Henry Galperin—and a newspaper battle began in this small college town which ended with ""The Newark Weekly"" purchasing the ""Newark Post"" -- and renaming the publication the ""Weekly Post"". The paper ran in this format for a number of years—even going daily as ""The Daily Post""—for less than a full year beginning in 1972—and returning to its weekly publication. In the early 1980s the ""Weekly Post"" ceased publication for a couple of years, but was revived by its owners in its original name as the ""Newark Post"", and since then has come back as a strong community newspaper."

"Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. (, known in English as the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, is a Czech brewery founded in 1842 and headquartered in Plzeň, Czech Republic. It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell; the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named ""pils"", ""pilsner"" and ""pilsener"" after Pilsner Urquell. The brewery name, ""Pilsner Urquell"", which can be roughly translated into English as ""the original source at Pilsen"", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in the Czech Republic and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in October 2016, Pilsner Urquell (excluding certain geographical areas) was sold to Japan based Asahi Breweries in March 2017."
"The brewery was founded in 1839 by both local Czech-speaking and German-speaking citizens in Bohemian city of Plzeň as (citizens' brewery, later translated to ""Měšťanský pivovar"" in Czech). The first beer was brewed here in 1842 by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. In 1859, “Pilsner Bier” was registered as a brand name at the local Chamber of Commerce and Trade. In 1869, a competitor was founded as a joint stock company, later known as Gambrinus. In 1898 the German trademark ""Urquell"" and Czech trademark ""Prazdroj"" were created, to underline the claim of being the older, original source of Pilsner beer. In 1932 ""Měšťanský pivovar"" merged with ""Plzeňské aciové pivovary"". In 1946, the brewery was nationalized under the name ""Plzeňské pivovary"" (Pilsen breweries)."
"After the fall of communism in late 1989, the brewery was turned into a public share company, then renamed in 1994 after the Czech name of their famous beer, ""Plzeňský Prazdroj"". In 1999, they started to merge with "" Pivovar Radegast a.s."" and ""Pivovar Velké Popovice a. s.""."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. It has been the largest exporter of beer produced in the Czech Republic since 2000 when production surpassed that of Budějovický Budvar. In 2016, the company was sold to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan."
"A brewery museum (""Pivovarské muzeum"") has been set up near the brewery in the authentic medieval brewing house with malt house, which has been declared a cultural monument. It includes the late Gothic malt house, kiln, original drying shed and two-level laying-down cellars with ice-cellar, which are hewn from the Pilsen substrata. The exhibition covers Pilsen's most ancient history, the development of crafts, the emergence and growth of the guilds, the beginnings and development of brewing, malting, the craft of cooper, haulage and catering."
The tour includes a replica of a pub from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and a laboratory from the second half of the 19th century. The city walls have been opened with an example of the cultivation of barley and hops.
The museum has become an anchor for the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

He was thrown off his bike and landed on an unfinished barrier in the race track. Buncio crashed onto a protruding steel rod of the barrier, which punctured his internal organs, fatally damaging his kidney and liver."
Buncio was thrown off some 100 meters from his bike and was impaled on a protruding reed bar in an unfinished barrier on the Clark Speedway Circuit. He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Mabalacat and transferred to the UST Hospital in the wee hours of 15 May and was pronounced dead at 3:57 PM on the same day due to massive internal bleeding. The father of the late superbike champion Maico Buncio raised questions over the first aid procedure done on the rider during his fatal crash at the Clark Speedway Circuit.
"He said that the Aeromed's medical response team pulled the victim's body from the steel bar. This, he said, might have caused his son's death. The bar punctured his body and damaged his kidney and liver. Instead of cutting the steel bar to free Maico, the AeroMed emergency staffers decided to pull the young motorcycle champion free from his entanglement. This, they learned later, caused massive internal damage to Maico's organs and prompted him to scream in pain."
"Dr. Reynante Mirano, chief of St. Luke’s Hospital Emergency Medicine, said that instead of pulling Buncio’s body from the protruding metal, the medics should have cut the steel bar."
"Maico Buncio left a memorable quote to his fellow riders ""Never stop riding, because I didn't."""
Buncio's wake was held in the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City and he was laid to rest in the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City on 21 May 2011. A motorcade organized by his fellow riders marked his funeral procession.

"Itbāy () or ʿAtbāy is a region of southeastern Egypt and northeastern Sudan. It is characterised by a chain of mountains, the Red Sea Hills, running north–south and parallel with the Red Sea. The hills separate the narrow coastal plain from the Eastern Desert."
"The Red Sea Hills are composed of the exposed Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rock of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Although the rock itself is 550–900 million years old, the mountains were created by uplift when the Red Sea itself was formed in the Oligocene, only some 23–34 million years ago. The Red Sea Hills are thus part of the same formation as the Sarawat Mountains of Saudi Arabia and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula. The Red Sea Hills rise almost to today, but in the past were much higher. The Oligocene uplift caused the rejuvenation of their streams and the increased erosion removed most of the limestone and sandstone to expose the basement layer."
"The Itbāy is arid, receiving less than of rainfall each year with high variability. The Barka River, the most significant of the few seasonal streams that flow into the Red Sea, rises in the Red Sea Hills of Sudan and empties into the sea at the Tokar Delta. In prehistorica times it was probably a permanent river."
"The Red Sea Hills are a source of porphyry, which was being mined as early as the fourth millennium BC."
"The Red Sea Hills are inhabited by the Beja people, who practice pastoralism and live mainly near the dry riverbeds, ""wādī""s, that flow seasonally into the sea and the Nile, where there is limited vegetation. In antiquity, the Beja were known as the Blemmyes and their presence in the hills is detected archaeologically by the presence of Eastern Desert Ware from the fourth century AD. The material culture of the hills places it firmly within ancient Egypt's sphere of influence. Extensive mining settlements have been found in the Wadi Allaqi and the Wadi Gabgaba. The early Blemmyes built platform tumuli (flat-topped burial mounds), and the appearance of cairns to mark burials in the late Middle Ages may be linked to Islamization."

"An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (""vici"") and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (""Tabula Peutingeriana""); another is the Antonine Itinerary."
"The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The ""itinerarium"" filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: ""at their most basic, ""itineraria"" involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script."" It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user."
"The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master ""itinerarium"" set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies."

Tommy Albelin (born 21 May 1964) is a retired Swedish ice hockey defenceman who is currently an assistant coach for Switzerland's national team. He also competed in the men's tournament at the 1998 Winter Olympics.
"Albelin has, over the course of a 24-year professional career, played a total of 952 games for three NHL teams: the Quebec Nordiques, the New Jersey Devils, and the Calgary Flames. Albelin was drafted 152nd overall by Quebec in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft. Before joining the club he played five seasons for Djurgårdens IF in the Swedish Elitserien, winning the Swedish championship in his first year (1982–83). Albelin left for Quebec upon the conclusion of the 1986-87 season. He played a year and a half for the Nordiques before being traded to New Jersey. It would be with the Devils that he would play 10 seasons for and win two Stanley Cups, in 1995 and 2003. In 1996, he was traded to Calgary, but he signed to play with New Jersey again in 2001. His best season was the 1988–89 season when he put up 37 points. Albelin announced his retirement from hockey on 29 July 2004, however the Devils re-signed him in December 2005 (abbreviating his retirement after he had practiced with the team as an unsigned player for nearly half the season). He finished out his final year in 2006 playing for the Devils."
"On 25 July 2007, Albelin was hired by the New Jersey Devils as an assistant coach to head coach Brent Sutter. It was his first NHL coaching job."
"On 10 August 2010, Albelin was named assistant coach of the Albany Devils, the AHL affiliate of the New Jersey Devils. On 9 September 2014, following Scott Stevens' decision to step down from a coaching position in New Jersey, Albelin was promoted to be an assistant coach under Peter DeBoer in the 2014-15 season."
"In July 2016, he was appointed as assistant coach of the Swiss men's national team."
= = = Witteric = = =
"Witteric (; Portuguese and Galician: ""Viterico""; 565 – April 610) was the Visigoth King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia. He ruled from 603 to 610."
"The first mention of Witteric in history was as a conspirator with Sunna, the Arian bishop of Mérida, to reestablish Arianism in 589. While Sunna was sent into exile, it is unknown what happened to Witteric. In the spring of 602, Witteric was given command of the army with the job of expelling the Byzantines. However, when it came time to do so in the Spring of 603, Witteric instead led his troops against King Liuva II, counting on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. He invaded the royal palace and deposed the young king. Witteric cut off the king's right hand, and then had him condemned and executed in the Summer of 603."
"During his reign, the Visigoths fought the Byzantines. However, Isidore of Seville is dismissive of Witteric's accomplishments, writing that ""although he frequently fought battles against the Roman soldiers, he did not win any adequate glory except for capturing some soldiers at Sagunto with the help of his generals."" The campaign against Sagunto probably took place in 605. It was probably during his reign, as well, that Bigastrum (near Cartago Nova) was taken, as its bishop appears in a council of Toledo in 610."
"In the twelfth year of his reign, king Theodoric II sent for bishop Aridius of Lyons and the constable Eborin to ask Witteric for his daughter Ermenburga's hand in marriage. Although the envoys gave their word that she would not be disowned by Theodoric, and she was received by Theodoric in Chalon-sur-Saône (606), his grandmother, the regent Brunhilda and Theodoric's sister Teudila (or Teudilana) did not provide a welcoming reception. Theodoric then disgraced Ermenberga by sending her back without her dowry. Incensed, Witteric entered into a quadruple alliance with Theodobert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf of the Lombards to effect his deposition and death. Despite their mutual fear of Theodoric, their alliance did not accomplish anything; according to Fredegar, ""Theodoric got wind of it [the alliance] but treated it with utter contempt.""."
"In April 610, a faction of Catholic nobles conspired against Witteric and assassinated him during a banquet. His body was dragged ignominiously through the streets and he was later buried without the honors corresponding to his status. The nobles then proclaimed Gundemar, Duke of Narbonne, king."

= = = Proteus (2003 film) = = =
"Proteus is a film by Canadian director John Greyson. Although the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2003, it did not have a general theatrical release until 2005."
The film is based on an early 18th century court record from Cape Town.
"The film also attempts to explore unanswered questions, such as why prison officials tolerated the relationship for a full decade before Blank and Jacobsz were executed. (In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship when they were very young - Blank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16 - and were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40.) Intentional anachronisms - such as transistor radios, electric typewriters and jeeps - are also used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions are still very much present in today's world. These twentieth-century objects, including modern (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, are invariably presented in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate, who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead. A 'wetbag' is seen, as it was used as a torture devise in Apartheid South Africa."
"An extract from the speech Nelson Mandela made at his sentencing hearing in 1964, before he was imprisoned on Robben Island, is displayed at the end of the film."
"From independence to the time of his death he was associated with cricket in Pakistan and dedicated all his life and abilities for the promotion of Pakistan cricket. In recognition of his service one of the gates of the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium carries his name, ""Maqsood Ahmed Enclosure"" and so does one of the benches at the Bagh-e-Jinnah Cricket Ground located inside the historic Lahore Gymkhana."

"In October 1952, in Pakistan's second Test match and first Test victory, he became the first player to score a Test century for Pakistan, and the first player to remain on the ground for an entire Test match. An opening batsman, he carried his bat for his score of '124 not out' in Pakistan's total of 331 in an innings victory over India, batting for 8 hours 35 minutes."
"Shortly after the series, he injured his arm, ending his career. According to Omar Noman, ""as the famous story goes,"" Nazar sustained the injury jumping out from the house window of the film actress Noor Jehan when her film producer husband Shaukat Hussain Rizvi returned home unexpectedly and surprised them. There were persistent rumors in the local newspapers, at the time, of a romantic affair going on between Noor Jehan and Nazar Mohammad."
His son Mudassar Nazar also represented Pakistan in cricket for many years in the 1970s and 1980s.
"= = = An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman = = ="
"""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman"" is the opening line of a category of joke popular in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The nationalities involved may vary, though they are usually restricted to those within Ireland and the UK, and the number of people involved is usually three or sometimes four. In Ireland, the characters are sometimes called ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman"". Depending on who is telling the joke, one nationality fares well and the other nationalities fare poorly according to national stereotypes. For example, in England the punchline is usually based around the Irishman being stupid, the Scotsman being mean or miserly, and the Englishman being posh (or a snob but ultimately not the butt of the joke), whereas in Scotland and Ireland, the Englishman will typically be the butt of the joke. Sometimes, when the joke requires four people, a Welshman is brought in."
"The joke typically starts with the home or favoured nationality and ends with the nationality and associated stereotype against which the joke is made. For example, in England, the joke begins ""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman..."" whereas in Ireland it begins ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman""."
"The joke typically places the three characters in a scenario. How each person in the joke reacts to the scenario is then explained in order by person, the final reaction being the punch line, playing up to the stereotype of that nationality. The joke uses the rule of three, the first two characters being used to set up an expectation which is then subverted in some way by the third."
"The ""three nationalities"" joke format is also very common in other countries. In these cases, the two foreigners are almost always portrayed as cocky, stupid, or naïve, while the home national is smart, practical, or in any case ultimately victorious."
"The joke need not necessarily involve nationalities. Jokes about the hard sciences may begin ""A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer..."""

Waqar Hasan (; born 12 September 1932) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in 21 Test matches from 1952 to 1959.
"Waqar Hasan attended Government College, Lahore, where he played for the cricket team. He toured England with the Pakistan Eaglets team of young cricketers in 1951."
"An ""attractive stroke-making right-handed batsman, who was ideal in a crisis"", he played in Pakistan's first 18 Tests, including its first five victories. In Pakistan's first Test series, against India in 1952–53, he was the highest scorer on either side, with 357 runs at an average of 44.62, playing several defiant innings when Pakistan were in trouble. He was less successful on the 1954 tour of England, with 103 runs at 14.71, but impressed with his fielding in the covers."
"He scored his only Test century against New Zealand in 1955–56 at Lahore, when he made 189 in 430 minutes, adding 309 for the seventh wicket with Imtiaz Ahmed after the score had been 111 for 6. His 189 set a new record for Pakistan's highest Test score which lasted only until Ahmed (who made 209) overtook it the next day. Hasan played five more Tests without reaching 50."
"He played first-class cricket in Pakistan from 1949 to 1966, with a highest score of 201 not out for L. W. Cannon's XI against Hasan Mahmood's XI in 1953–54. He captained Karachi Blues to victory in the final of the 1963–64 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and in his last first-class match he captained them to victory in the 1964–65 competition."
He served as a national selector several times from the 1960s to the 1980s. He was the chief selector when Pakistan beat India 3–0 at home in 1982-83.

"Fagan's choreography incorporates elements of modern dance, ballet, Afro-Caribbean dance, and social dance. Many of his works are autobiographical or include themes of personal relevance. His untitled 1977 work chronicles the dissolution of his marriage, showing a couple beginning a relationship with affection and passion but eventually drifting apart due to inevitable obstacles. ""Griot New York,"" which premiered in 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is about the experiences of the underprivileged living in New York City. The piece juxtaposes linear balletic movement with sharp angular gestures, twitching, and erotic partnering to represent the diversity and contrast found in big cities as well as conflict in his own life. In ""Moth Dreams,"" choreographed in 1992, Fagan celebrates his childhood, adolescence, and relationship with his mother."

This telenovela was filmed in the Dominican Republic.
"Ana Paula Treviño dreams of falling in love with Aníbal Paz-Soldán, one of the richest millionaires in the country. One day while walking in the streets, Ana Paula's purse is snatched, and she unfortunately mistakes a witness by-stander, Fernando, to be the thief. Fernando is captivated by Ana Paula's beauty and charm, and he is instantly attracted to her. Fernando later discovers that Ana Paula is poor and must work hard in her father's boarding house in order to try to pay their debts. So, he decides to conquer Ana Paula's heart by omitting that he is a Paz-Soldán, and lying that he is merely an employee at the Paz-Soldán company."
"Although Ana Paula and Fernando develop a close friendship, she cannot stop thinking about Aníbal, the man of her dreams. Aníbal is the opposite of Fernando: he is proud and arrogant, looks down upon people below his class, and would not even bother to look at a girl like Ana Paula twice.

"The Nanto-Bordelaise Company — formally ""La Compagnie de Bordeaux et de Nantes pour la Colonisation de l’Île du Sud de la Nouvelle Zélande et ses Dépendances"" — was a French company inaugurated in 1839 by a group of merchants from the cities of Nantes and Bordeaux, with the purpose of founding a French colony in the South Island of New Zealand."
"The company was formed after negotiations in August 1838 between whaling boat captain Jean-François Langlois and several Ngai Tahu Māori chiefs for the purchase of several thousand acres of land on Banks Peninsula, for which Langlois promised to pay a total of 1,000 francs. Upon returning to France in 1839, Langlois set about founding a company with the help of several financial backers, the eventual aim of which was to claim the entirety of the South Island for France. Government support was obtained in December of the same year via King Louis-Philippe to transport 80 settlers to Port Louis-Philippe (now Akaroa). A warship, the corvette ""Aube"", would travel to New Zealand, followed a month later by the colonists aboard . ""Aube"" left for the Pacific in February 1840, captained by Charles François Lavaud, who had been appointed as Commissaire du Roi."
"Aware of the potential threat of losing sovereignty of parts of the New Zealand island chain to the French, during early 1840, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson was tasked with securing the whole of the country for the British Government. To this end, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed as an agreement between the British Crown and the indigenous Māori population. By the time ""Aube"" arrived at the Bay of Islands in June 1840, the acquisition of the country by Britain was effectively complete. Faced with no prospect of anything more than a small colonial settlement, Lavaud left for Banks Peninsula to oversee the arrival of ""Comte de Paris"". Hobson also sent a ship, HMS ""Britomart"", on board which were colonial magistrates."
"On arriving at Akaroa, Lavaud discovered that the agreement between Langlois and the local Māori was not as clear-cut as had been promised. Despite this, the founding of the colony went ahead, under an amalgam of French and British jurisdiction. C.B. Robinson, one of the magistrates sent on ""Britomart"", worked alongside Lavaud in the organisation of the settlement. Lavaud retired in 1843, and was succeeded as Commissaire du Roi by Post-Captain A. Bérard, who remained in this position until 1846, when formal agreements between the French government and the Nanto-Bordelaise Company settlement ended."
"The question of sovereignty remained a complex one, which the local colonial authorities were unable to solve. Eventually, the British Government resolved that the company would be awarded four acres of land for every £1 they could prove to have spent on the settlement. On 30 June 1849, the company's remaining New Zealand properties were bought by the New Zealand Company for the sum of £4,500. A second ship carrying more French settlers, ""Monarch"", arrived at Akaroa in 1850."

She withdrew from the endorsement process after the third ballot after falling behind Kelley, with Hatch's vote total increasing. She subsequently ran an opposition campaign against Hatch in the September primary, losing with 24% of the popular vote."
"Lourey's gubernatorial campaign health care platform was the Health Care Security Plan, which included the details to put a universal health coverage system in place in Minnesota by 2010. That system would have been voluntary, not mandatory as was the Massachusetts health program that was enacted into law in Spring 2006. The platform also included other state-level health reform proposals, including the current Minnesota Medical Association's proposal."
"At the heart of the Lourey health care plan was an expanded and reformed ""MinnesotaCare"", a state program providing health insurance coverage for low-income Minnesotans that she, along with several others, had authored in the state legislature in 1993. Under her Health Care Security Plan, all Minnesotans would have been eligible to join the new MinnesotaCare by 2010. Employers could participate by offering their employer plan via the new BusinessCare program to be created as part of the revised MinnesotaCare. There were several cost containment measures in Lourey's Health Care Security Plan, including a requirement that any HMOs, private health insurers or Third Party Administrators receiving contracts to administer state-funded health plans spend no more than 5% on administrative expenses."

"A distinctive feature of many Australasian trams was the ""drop-centre"", a lowered central section between bogies (wheel-sets), to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to get inside of the vehicle."
"Californian combination cars had an enclosed centre section, with open-sided sections at each end. Hong Kong or toast rack (toastrack) cars were open, with the roof supported by a row of stanchions on each side. Most electric trams were single-deck, but Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and initially Dunedin had some open-top double-deck trams. These were popular with courting couples! The Wellington Fiducia trams had access at each end only, with no separate middle section or centre doors."
"The Engineers of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company, BET Company designed their own tramcars, earlier models were built by Brush Engineering in Loughborough, construction post the Great War was exclusively by Auckland Coach Builders and increasingly the Tramway's own workshops at Royal Oak on Manukau Road. Rear entrance Dinghy ""A type"" four wheelers, and toast rack trams were trialled in the early years and a small number of C type double deckers used until the 1920s. The ""Combo"" or B type design pretty much laid the basic design of Auckland tram down from 1902. Entrances at either end, platform steps within the bodyline of the tramcar. The in-house design progression moved to the addition of windscreens, a separate Motorman's compartment from the M type in 1908 and a seat design and layout for 52 seated passengers that remained standard until closure in 1956. Dalliance with riveted steel construction with the Art Deco ""Semi-steel"" N type in the 1920s which included butterfly [double set] destinations set in a V shape which could be read even when trams were parked bumper to bumper, double set saloon doorways a return to traditional wooden construction with the 1929/30 Big Cars with minor improvements to seating design and finally the 1930s Streamliner design, which had curving pillar frames, 7'6"" over the chassis and 8' at the window sill level and reducing again to the roofline. The design change of the bodies was cosmetically pleasing, but still seated only 52 passengers on wooden seats. Six of the streamliners used EMB trucks imported from the UK, primarily where they were used under Double Deckers. The remainder used Brush Improved Trucks, a design little changed for 30 years which were the mainstay of the Auckland fleet."
"Trams were standard gauge (), except for Wellington and Gisborne, ; Dunedin, ; Napier and the Maori Hill (Dunedin) , the New Zealand railway gauge."

"Alfapop (, transliteration for: ""Alphapop"") is a Serbian power pop band from Belgrade."
"The band was formed in 2000 under the name Tir na n'Og (after Tír na nÓg, the land of eternal youth in Irish mythology). Initially, the band performed Irish folk and Celtic rock, and released one Celtic rock-oriented album. In 2008, the band changed the name to Alfapop and turned towards power pop sound, releasing their second album in 2010."
"The band was formed in 2000 by a group of Irish music enthusiasts. At first mostly playing Irish folk and songs by The Pogues and Young Dubliners, they gained audience's attention. Having changed a number of members the band got a stable lineup featuring Jovana Vujnović (vocals), Jovan Dragumilo (guitar and vocals), Miroslav Kočić (violin), Damir Žigić (drums) and Ranko Radovanov (bass guitar)."
"The band started recording their debut self-titled album in the autumn of 2005, and it was released in 2006 through One Records. The album featured songs both in English and Serbian language, with elements of punk rock and both Irish and Serbian folk music. Three promotional videos were recorded, for the tracks ""Brodovi"", ""Danny Boy"" and ""River""."
"In 2008, the band, now consisting of Vujnović, Dragumilo and Radovanov only, changed the name to Alfapop and started playing power pop, continuing, however, to perform songs they recorded as Tir na n'Og. In 2010, the band released the album ""Alfapop"" through Bulgarian record label AMAdea Records. The album featured nine songs in Serbian language, and the electronic music song ""Fantasy"", recorded by Vujnović, as the bonus track. Promotional videos were recorded for the songs ""Sati"" (""Hours"") and ""Hoću još"" (""I Want More""). The song ""Kao prvi put"" (""Like the First Time"") is a duet recorded with Charlie B singer Lazar Drecun."

Sarm East Studios is a recording studio that was located on Osborn Street at the southern end of Brick Lane in east London.
The studio was established by Jill Sinclair and her brother John Sinclair with the help of engineers Mike Stone and Gary Lyons in 1973. It was previously called The City of London Recording Studios.
"The studio played host to artists such as Queen, Madonna, the Clash, Depeche Mode, Rush, Yes, ABC, INXS, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal and the Hoosiers."
"SARM East was later owned by SPZ Group, a holding company belonging to Jill Sinclair and her husband, producer Trevor Horn. It was closed down in the late 1990s, but Sarm Music Village belonging to SPZ group continues its legacy."
The studio had an early Solid State Logic (SSL) 4000E mixing console and was one of the first studios in London to install one. The SSL replaced an earlier Trident console with Allison automation.
"Multitracks were twin Studer A80s (to be replaced later by Studer A800 Mk IIIs) with Dolby A and mixdown machine was a Studer A80 with a 1/2"" headblock and Dolby A. Outboard gear included:"

Uyghur separatists had committed the bombings. Responsibility for the attacks was claimed and acknowledged by factions of certain diaspora Uyghurs.
"Continuing tensions in Xinjiang have been a source of terrorism in China. Conflicts over Uyghur cultural aspirations resurfaced during the 1960s. In early February 1997 the execution of 30 suspected separatists who had been involved in the organisation of Meshrep during Ramadan resulted in large demonstrations, which culminated in the Gulja incident on 5 February, in which at least nine protesters were killed."

"Saint Mark's English Church is an Anglican church in Florence, Italy."
"The church forms part of the chaplaincy of St Mark's Florence with St Peter's Siena, which also includes a congregation in Bologna, in the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England."
"The chaplain is Father William Lister. The average congregation is about 150. The church ministers to the homeless in Florence. It is also used for classical music concerts and opera, with a resident opera company."
"St Mark's was founded by the Reverend Charles Tooth as a centre of worship for Anglo-Catholic members of the Anglican Church in Florence. He started a house church at 1 Via dei Serragli in 1877 to teach Anglo-Catholic principles and celebrate the Holy Eucharist daily during the week. In 1880, Tooth purchased a 15th-century palazzo to meet the new congregation's needs. John Roddam Spencer Stanhope designed and created the wall and ceiling decorations at his own expense. The first Holy Eucharist was celebrated there on 1 May 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. The premises were extended by the purchase of 16 Via Maggio in 1906."
"The church was damaged by the 1966 Flood of the Arno River, resulting in the loss of George Frederick Bodley's 19th-century stencil work on the lower walls, although some survived behind a display cabinet."
"St. Mark's was the second Anglican church to be built in Florence. The British community in Florence has a long history and the chaplaincy began in the late 1820s. The first church, Holy Trinity, opened in the 1840s. Rebuilt in the 1890s, Trinity Church on the Via Lamarmara, is today a Waldensian Church."
"The white marble statue in the niche over the main door is ""Apotheosis of Saint Mark"" (2007–8) by Jason Arkles. This is the first work by an American sculptor to have a permanent public location in Florence."
"The building was altered by Tooth, who turned the ground floor into a church with nave, aisles, transept and chancel, about long and seating 400. The interior is decorated in the Pre-Raphaelite style and the upper reaches of the church have floral motifs with, as described by art historian Berenice Schreiner, ""a wonderful sense of naturalism""."

= = = Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower = = =
"The Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower was a proposed Gothic complex designed for a site in London adjacent to Westminster Abbey. The plans, exhibited at the Royal Academy in March 1904, included a tower that would have dominated the Clock Tower and Victoria Tower of the nearby Houses of Parliament. It was never built."
"The design by John Pollard Seddon – then diocesan architect for London – and Edward Beckitt Lamb (son of Edward Buckton Lamb) was based on earlier schemes that each had proposed separately, and was one of many extensions proposed for Westminster Abbey in late 19th and early 20th centuries by architects such as George Gilbert Scott, George John Shaw Lefevre, James Fergusson, and Henry Travis. In particular, the clergy at Westminster Abbey were concerned that the church was becoming crowded with monuments, and more space was needed. Some of the proposed designs were considered by a Royal Commission in 1891. The issue was given added impetus after the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902 by a desire for Westminster Abbey to become a fitting Imperial monument, to compete with the baroque St Paul's Cathedral where Queen Victoria had commemorated her Diamond Jubilee in 1897."
"The architects aspired to create a grand and expensive monument to ""form a worthy centre to the metropolis of the Empire 'upon which the sun never sets' "" ."
"The complex was planned to be joined to the Great Cloister of Westminster Abbey, leading to a reception hall beneath the tower, with the main body of the building - the Great Monumental Hall - stretching along Great College Street, incorporating smaller side halls. The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, wide and deep."
"The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on the lower floors, with archives on the upper floors."
"It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament close by."
"The scheme of work would have included the completion of the tower over the crossing at Westminster Abbey. ""The Builder"" magazine criticised the scheme as exhibiting a degree of megalomania ."

"Eleanor Rigby is a 2004 novel by Douglas Coupland, about a lonely woman at ages 36 and 42. The novel is written as a first-person narrative by the main character, Liz Dunn."
"The novel centres on changes to Liz's life when someone from her past unexpectedly re-enters her life. It is written in a light, often comic, tone, but resonates on many deeper issues, including loneliness, family, religious visions and multiple sclerosis."
"Two distinct plot movements are separated by a break in the narrative flow. The first part of the novel involves two retellings: the story of Liz Dunn’s trip to Europe and her pregnancy, and the story of the re-emergence into her life of her child, Jeremy, who is dying of multiple sclerosis."
"As a teenager, Liz goes on a trip to Europe, her one big expressive moment. On this trip, while drunk, she loses her virginity in Italy to a man she cannot remember. From this experience, she becomes pregnant with Jeremy, who is put up for adoption, and goes in and out of foster families for much of his young life."
"Jeremy arrives back into Liz’s life when she is at a low point of loneliness. His illness is terminal, and because of drug abuse, he has only a short time to live. Jeremy’s introduction into Liz’s life rattles the lonely world she has constructed, opening up her and her world."
"The first part of the novel, narrated by Liz, jumps between these two moments, constantly reminding the reader that these are moments in the past. There is a symbolic page break between the first section, which takes place in the past, and the second section, which takes place in the novel’s present."
"In the present, Jeremy has died. Liz finds a meteorite that she takes to be a very precious object. She sleeps with it under her pillow to keep it close. She eventually, through a list of circumstances, decides to travel to Europe to find Jeremy’s father, a trip which again leads her to a world of excitement, police and army incidents, and a reunion with Jeremy’s father."
"Liz Dunn is the protagonist of this novel. She is an overweight, lonely woman, who lives a removed solitary existence. Her apartment, for instance, can only accommodate one person."
"Coupland has spoken extensively about the character of Liz Dunn, claiming that she was his most realistic character."
"Liz’s son Jeremy, who was sent out for adoption, has a terminal case of multiple sclerosis. He has traveled through the foster-care system of British Columbia, residing with many families who abused him. He eventually reconnects with Liz after finding her and registers her as his next of kin for emergencies. When he is hospitalized, Liz reconnects with her son."
"Jeremy is cheerful in the face of his condition, happy with the life that he has left to lead. He eventually becomes a successful mattress salesman in the time leading up to his death. He experiences visions of a post-apocalyptic future, which enthralls Liz. He envisions a future where crops have gone foul and farmers ask a divine voice for guidance."
The inspiration for Eleanor Rigby was loneliness. Coupland suffered through a period in his early twenties he describes as being caused by loneliness.
"The novel is named after The Beatles' song of the same name. The song reference was inspired from a moment in Coupland's past. Coupland heard the song ""on a friend's mother's record player. And the story threw me: 'Oh my God, what happened to her?' The lyrics didn't tell you much but in my head I always saw her as an only child of very old parents who didn't have a clue and she was left in a rectory and died without leaving any mark anywhere ... The book's not like that, of course, but it's the mood and the way Liz describes herself."" The song itself features in the narrative as it is Liz Dunn's email address."

= = = Rubber chicken = = =
"A rubber chicken is a prop used in comedy. The phrase is also used as a description for food served at speeches, conventions, and other large meetings, and as a metaphor for speechmaking."
A rubber chicken is an imitation plucked fowl made in a latex injection mold.
"The origin of the rubber chicken is obscure, but is possibly based on the use of pig bladders, which were inflated, attached to a stick and used as props or mock-weapons by jesters in the days before the development of plastic and latex. Chicken corpses were readily available; therefore jesters could employ them as variations of slapsticks."
"One account attributes the first use of a prop chicken to John Holmberg, the Swedish black-faced clown of the early 1900s. Holmberg would perform with his pockets full of fake food to mock the gluttony reportedly prevalent among the upper classes at the time."
A claim that the symbol originated during the French Revolution with soldiers hanging a chicken from their muskets for luck is printed on the tag of rubber chickens manufactured by Archie McPhee.
"The term ""rubber chicken"" is used disparagingly to describe the food served at political or corporate events, weddings, and other gatherings where there are a large number of guests who require serving in a short timeframe. Often, pre-cooked chicken is held at serving temperature for some time and then dressed with a sauce as it is served. Consequently, the meat may be tough or “rubbery.” Someone who ""travels the rubber chicken circuit"" is said to do so by attending or making speeches at many such gatherings, often as part of political campaigning."

"Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too."
Email
"Electronic mail is digital mechanism for exchanging messages through internet or intranet communication platforms. The first message that was sent through a computer was on October 29, 1969. Raymond Tomlinson is known as the father of email, he was the first person who sent a message electronically. Email messages consist of three different components: message envelope, message header, and message body. There are also multiple benefits to using email. It is easy to use, free of charge, fast, and delivers information in a digital format. Email is one of the earliest and most basic resources on the internet and those many computers may not be able to access other internet services they are still usually able to exchange emails with machines on the internet. There are many reasons why using email is more suitable when it comes to the workforce. the first reason is because it is faster than a conventional mail so that usually reaches its destination and minutes even when it's sent from different countries. Another reason why an email is more conventional is because of the fact that there is less physical efforts .while using email you don't have to worry about buying stamps or envelopes or taking a trip to the post office. Also the use of email helps in the financial state because once you have gotten the hardware and software together it is basically free from there on. Email messaging also helps when having to send the same message to multiple people because of the fact that it allows you to send the same information simultaneously."
Text message
"A text message is defined as a short message sent electronically usually from one cellphone to another. The first text message was sent in December 3, 1992. The engineer that discovered text messaging was named Matti Makkonen. Along with the development of text messaging came a new development of dialogue when texting. As I stated in while texting people tend to exaggerate how they usually talk. An example of this or shown in blank where somebody may state that ""this homework is so hard I'm going to kill myself!!"" This dialogue is normal and texting but not entirely appropriate and other scenarios. Another thing that texting changed was a person's grammar or writing style. In it showed that 75% of friends noted that their best friends grammar or writing styles. Though only 25% of acquaintances noticed that their friends grammar or writing styles had changed. The evolution of texting is evolving and its uses it is not only being used to communicate with friends and family but it is also spreading to the workforce. According to in Zambia they are finding the results of HIV testing faster due to mobile phone texting. The turnaround time for results notifying went from health facilities reporting the results in 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post inflammation due to texting.

"Oteyboydak Tleukabyluly (1388–1478), was a Kazakh scientist, healer and author of solid medical-ethnographic works Shipagerlik Bayan. He was familiar with such historical personalities as Zhanibek khan, Zhirenshe sheshen. O. Tleukabyluly was a well-known public figure, involved in dealing with the plight of the people. The dates of his birth are taken from his book Shipagerlik Bayan. He writes that he started writing this book at the age of 70 at the request of Zhanibek khan and finished it at the age of 85; after Zhanibek khan’s death. There is also evidence that Oteyboydak died at the age of 90. He inherited his medical and healer gift from his ancestors. O.Tleukabyluly devoted his life to treatment and brought traditional (folk) medicine in the academic system. Thus, he was able to raise the medicine of his time at a high level. In this respect, he, like al-Farabi, despised thirst for fame, wealth, and devoted his life to the study of the peculiarities of healing. The book Shipagerlik Bayan has survived until today, thanks to his relatives. But only fourth part of the rich heritage, having gone through the test of time, has reached our days. The rest part was burnt by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in China. This book gives a lot of information on traditional Kazakh medicine. The fact that he used a variety of compounds (mixture), offered over 4000 recipes, convinces us that Oteyboydak was an experienced healer and an outstanding scientist. His book mentions medical properties of 728 kinds of drugs of plant origin, 318 kind of medicine of animal origin, 52 types of medicines derived from metals and metalloids, 8 kinds of rare and precious drugs, as well as references to some 500 anatomical terms. It witnesses that the book has the historical-ethnographic importance as well as the depth and richness of the Kazakh language. The book was published in 1994 in Kazakh Cyrillic script in Urumgi, In 1996 - in the Kazakh Cyrillic script in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In 1997 the book was awarded China’s National Book award. Two public medical centers for studying O.Tleukabyluly’s heritage were created in China. The monument to O.Tleukabyluly has been erected on Shalkode Zhailau in Almaty area and one street was named after him in Almaty.

= = = DCEThreads = = =
DCEThreads is an implementation of POSIX Draft 4 threads.
"DCE/RPC was under development, but the POSIX committee had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection."
"POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads."
"DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources."
"The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the ""Remote"" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed."
"Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation."
DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer.

"The Los Cerritos Center is a super regional shopping mall located in Cerritos, California. Since September 1971, the Los Cerritos Center has been an integral part of the city of Cerritos' tax revenue. The mall is the city's largest revenue source, producing $581 per square foot in sales ($296 million total) in 2010. The tax revenue generated from the Los Cerritos Center for its host city totals to approximately $3 million a year. The facility is owned by Macerich & GIC Private Limited."
"The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency initially invested $30 million for the development of the Los Cerritos Center area. The shopping area built at Gridley Road and South Street was developed by Ernest M. Hahn, Inc. in September 1971 with the Phase I opening of the corridor from The Broadway department store (currently Macy's) to Ohrbach's (first became a Mervyn's, currently a Forever 21) and J.W. Robinson's (became Robinsons-May in 1993) in addition to having an initial 150 specialty stores. Phase II followed in 1971 with the opening of the wing from Ohrbach's to Sears. In 1981, Phase III saw the opening of Nordstrom and its first wing. In November 1993, Phase IV was completed when the Palm Court Cafes debuted in the Center with 14 eateries."
"At its opening, the Los Cerritos Center was one of the area's first shopping malls and was noted for its high quality maintenance and complete climate-controlled environment."
"The original goal of the center was to bring thousands of dollars of sales tax revenue to the city of Cerritos. In its first four years, the city of Cerritos' retail sales grew tenfold, topping over $207 million in 1974."
"In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off its 235 properties, including the Sears at Los Cerritos Center, into Sertiage Growth Properties."
"Since the end of 2015, the center has been undergoing a large-scale renovation, which brought in new anchors such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Harkins Theatres, in-line stores, remodeled interiors, new furnishings and lighting, exterior landscaping, as well as art work and overall re-branding."
"The Macy's wing houses merchandise, confectionery, and services for the family, the main concourse holds more upscale fashion stores, restaurants and boutiques, and the Sears wing focuses on specialty shops in entertainment, younger consumers, as well as the newly renovated Dining Court."
"Forever 21, which opened in January 2010 from the old Mervyn's store, was the first flagship styled store for the retailer in the United States and opened to much acclaim."
"A brand new, relocated Nordstrom department store and wing opened in May 2010 on the site of a former Robinsons-May. The added wing made room for nine additional in-line shops and restaurants. The old Nordstrom site was demolished for redevelopment and is now the site of a 16-screen Harkins Theatres which opened in spring 2016, as well as The Cheesecake Factory, which opened in November 2015."
"Realizing the importance of multiculturalism and diversity in the region today, the Los Cerritos Center, in conjunction with the city of Cerritos, is home to the Festival of Friendship held every February. Cultural booths and performances are held annually with the goal of reaching out to the various diverse communities the center serves."
"In 2010, 8.5 million shoppers visited the mall with November 26 (Black Friday) marking the biggest day of the year with 79,682 visitors. The daily average attendance from January through November 2010 was 22,133 people a day. December 2010 saw an average of 35,631 a day. Los Cerritos Center is the most financially successful mall in the Southeast Los Angeles region."
"In early 2017, Red Robin closed to make way for a P. F. Chang's, which was opened in late 2017."
"On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide. The store closed on January 6, 2019."
"Set in 18th-century South Africa, the film dramatizes the true story of Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown) and Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands)."
"Herder Claas Blank was serving 10 years for ""insulting a Dutch citizen"" and Rijkhaart, was a Dutch sailor convicted of committing ""unnatural acts"" with another man. The two men initially hostile form a secret relationship, using trips to a private water-tank to bond. The two prisoners on Robben Island who were later executed for sodomy in 1735 by drowning, after jealousy of other inmates caused problems. Their relationship also had a racial component, as Jacobsz was a white Dutchman, while Blank was a black Khoi. The film also stars Shaun Smyth as Virgil Niven, a Scottish botanist who befriends Blank for his knowledge of South African flora, including the Protea but may in fact have his own sexual interest in Blank."

He made his NHL debut in the 2001-02 season, and split the next two seasons between the Lightning and AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons."
"Early in the 2003–04 season, Alexeev suffered a major shoulder injury which caused him to miss the rest of the season as the Lightning went on to claim their first Stanley Cup. Alexeev played a season in Russia before in the 2006–07 season, he returned to NHL and was a regular in the Lightning lineup. However, after 63 games, he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline. The Blackhawks chose not to offer Alexeev a contract in 2007, making him a free agent."
"Alexeev unable to live up to his draft status, ended his NHL tenure and returned to sign with Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Alexeev won the Gagarin Cup as champion of the KHL twice with Ak Bars, and scored the cup winning goal in 2010."

= = = Soybean oil = = =
"Soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean (""Glycine max""). It is one of the most widely consumed cooking oils. As a drying oil, processed soybean oil is also used as a base for printing inks (soy ink) and oil paints."
Chinese records dating prior to 2000 B.C. mention use of cultivated soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept.
"To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 °C (140–190 °F), rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as ""vegetable oil,"" or are ingredients in a wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed."
"In the 2002–2003 growing season, 30.6 million tons (MT) of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants."
"In 2018-2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT)."
"Per 100 g, soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat, 23 g of monounsaturated fat, and 58 g of polyunsaturated fat. The major unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil triglycerides are the polyunsaturates alpha-linolenic acid (C-18:3), 7-10%, and linoleic acid (C-18:2), 51%; and the monounsaturate oleic acid (C-18:1), 23%. It also contains the saturated fatty acids stearic acid (C-18:0), 4%, and palmitic acid (C-16:0), 10%."
"The high-proportion of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acid is undesirable for some uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low linolenic Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat."
Soybean oil is mostly used for frying and baking. It is also used as a condiment for salads.
"Soybean oil is one of many drying oils, which means that it will slowly harden (due to free-radical based polymerization) upon exposure to air, forming a flexible, transparent, and waterproof solid. Because of this property, it is used in some printing ink and oil paint formulations. However, other oils (such as linseed oil) may be superior for some drying oil applications."
"David (Dave) H. Garrison is the Host of the Faith & Liberty Talk Show, an American businessman, lawyer, and former Republican candidate for Congress from Texas. Garrison received national attention for his 2012 bid for United States Congress in the 25th district of Texas."

= = = Sambha gompa = = =
"Kamtsang Dargye Choekhorling Monastery, known locally as Sambha (Samba, Sampa) gompa (goenpa), is situated in Mustang district, Tukuche Village development committee (VDC), in the Western Development Region, Nepal. It is about within Tukuche town on the Annapurna trekking route/ gravel road from Pokhara to Jomsom in the Dhaulagiri zone. In 2013 the local higher secondary school, Shree Yogendra HSS was being expanded, and the entrance to the gompa is within the school site; off the main Beni Jomson road, west of the Kali Gandaki river."
"The founder of Sambha gompa is understood to have come from the DoKham area of Tibet, but his name is unknown. He lived in the village of Tukuche for some time and died during a period of mediation. Seven days after his death he became a rainbow body confirming his achievement of enlightenment. In 1935 the gompa was re-established by members of the Tulachan family."
The first and second incarnations (tulku) are understood to have been born into the Kharghar caste and came from Tibet.
3rd incarnation: Bhattachan family
During the tenure of the third incarnation the location of the gompa was moved to its current location. At the time there was no bridge and the river was difficult to cross. Therefore the villagers offered land to the monks to relocate the gompa within Tukuche village to ease their access.
"4th incarnation: Was from the Tulachan family based in Tukuche, whose given name was Karma Tashi Singye, but known locally as Dr Mangal Singh, having gained a medical doctorate in Switzerland. He died aged 49."
"5th incarnation: Born 28 years after the death of the previous incarnation, also from the Tulachan family in Tukuche has the monastic name Karma Dhomchhe Norbu Tenpi Gyaltshen Palsamgpo Rinpoche. He is the nephew of current head lama (2016) of Chhairo gompa Shashi Dhoj Tulachan. He was recognised by three senior rinpoches including Tai Situpa Rinpoche. He was enthroned aged 8 in 2004 in India."
"He is currently studying at Palpung Monastery in Himachal Pradesh under Kenting Tai Situpa. In order for the young tulku to be accepted by the thakali community, he needs to be enthroned in Sambha gompa, requiring extensive reconstruction of the residential quarters of the monastery."
"Lama Chh'eon-che, of the Gtsag Bris school of painting, was responsible for paintings on the wall behind the altar c. 1994."
"Other frescoes in the gompa depicting the sixteen Arhat on the south, north and eastern walls are by Khaipa Chhogyal, a distant relative of Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan's late father."
"Khaipa of Lupra is believed to have painted the Sin-yeb, but this painting no longer remains."
"Damaged roof timbers mean that water ingress has damaged many paintings in recent years. Although roof repairs commenced in 2015, this has yet to be completed due to lack of funds."
In 2013 there was very limited monastic activity. Tukuche has lost much of its population due to changes in trade routes and rural urban migration suffered by many small villages. This first occurred in the 1960s when China tried to restrict movement of Tibetans and most recently during the 2008 Olympics.
"Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan an artist from Tukuche village, is responsible for the continued management of the gompa and is seeking support for its physical and spiritual renovation, in addition to the restoration work at Chhairo gompa which he is also responsible for."
"A nun (anim) who also takes care of Rani gompa, looks after the site."
There is a part time monk sponsored by the current Ven Gyalpo Rinpoche who undertakes monastic rituals as required.
To the south of the monastery are the historical residential quarters for the monk body.
These facilities are not currently habitable and the courtyard is used for general storage from the gompa next door.
The gompa was restored in the 2000s.
"A stupa was constructed in the courtyard in memory of a Japanese man, married to a local Nepali, who was a donor for the reconstruction works."

"Since 1991, Aviles has collaborated extensively with his first cousin, the comedian and performer Elizabeth Marrero. He has also collaborated with other gay Puerto Rican performers such as Jorge Merced. Avilés is publicly gay, as he has indicated in interviews, and many of his dance pieces explore gay topics."
= = = Sideritis = = =
"Sideritis (Gr: σιδηρίτις), also known as ironwort, mountain tea and shepherd's tea, is a genus of flowering plants well known for their use as herbal medicine, commonly as an herbal tea. They are abundant in Mediterranean regions, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia, but can also be found in Central Europe and temperate Asia."
"In Greek ""sideritis"" can be literally translated as ""he who is made of iron"". The plant was known to ancient Greeks, specifically Pedanius Dioscorides and Theophrastus. Although Dioscorides describes three species, only one (probably ""S. scordioides"") is thought to belong to ""Sideritis"". In ancient times ""sideritis"" was a generic reference for plants capable of healing wounds caused by iron weapons during battles. However, others hold that the name stems from the shape of the sepal, which resembles the tip of a spear."
"In 2002, molecular phylogenetic research found ""Sideritis"" and five other genera to be embedded in ""Stachys"". Further studies will be needed before ""Stachys"", ""Sideritis"", and their closest relatives can be revised."
"Some schemes recognize and categorize up to 319 distinct species, subspecies, ecotypes, forms or cultivars, including:"
"Botanists have encountered difficulties in naming and classifying the varieties of ""Sideritis"" due to their subtle differences. One particularly confusing case is that of ""S. angustifolia"" Lagasca and ""S. tragoriganum"" Lagasca."
"The genus is composed of short (8–50 cm), xerophytic subshrubs or herbs, annual or perennial, that grow at high altitudes (usually over 1000 m) with little or no soil, often on the surface of rocks."
"It is pubescent, either villous or coated by a fine, woolly layer of microscopic intertwined hairs."
"""Sideritis"" inflorescence is verticillaster."
"Very popular in Greece, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria and North Macedonia, ""Sideritis scardica"" is used as a herb either for the preparation of herbal teas, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. The herbal tea is commonly prepared by decoction, by boiling the stems, leaves and flowers in a pot of water, then often serving with honey and lemon."
"Ironwort has been traditionally used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system and suppress common cold, the flu and other viruses, allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, even pain and mild anxiety."
"Scientists have suggested that the popular pronouncement of ironwort as panacea may have some basis in fact. Studies indicate a positive effect on many common ailments. Ironwort is known scientifically to be anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant. Active elements include diterpenoid and flavonoids. Significant research has been done on ironwort confirming its popular use to prevent colds, flu, and allergies. Most of this research has taken place in universities in the Netherlands and in Greece, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Albania, where the plant is indigenous."
"""Sideritis raeseri"" is the most commonly cultivated ""Sideritis"" in Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and North Macedonia, where advanced hybrids also exist. Planting is recommended during two periods (October–November or February–March in the Northern hemisphere) and gathering in July, when in full bloom. The plant is typically dried before usage."

"Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 – January 30, 2007) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became a major league infielder and manager."
"Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier was one of a handful of players who remained active during the World War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left-handed pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15–7 record with a league-best 1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944."
"Lanier, along with a dozen other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 1949. Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid at the time of his leaving for Mexico, but eventually signed a contract paying him the same amount as in 1946."
"Lanier rejoined the Cardinals in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his career with the New York Giants (1952–53) and the Browns (1953)."
"Over fourteen seasons, Lanier posted a 108–82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 1619 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games."

Jugantar was formed from the inner circle of Anushilan Samiti and it started preparation for an armed militancy activities to oust British from Indian soil;."
"Barin and Jatindranath Mukherjee alias Bagha Jatin were instrumental in the recruitment of many young revolutionaries from across Bengal. The revolutionaries formed the Maniktala group in Maniktala, Kolkata. It was a secret place where they started manufacturing bombs and collected arms and ammunition."
"Following the attempted killing of Kingsford by two revolutionaries Khudiram and Prafulla on 30 April 1908, the police intensified its investigation which led to the arrest of Barin and Aurobindo Ghosh on 2 May 1908, along with many of his comrades. The trial (known as the Alipore Bomb Case) initially sentenced Barin Ghosh and Ullaskar Datta to death. However, the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, by Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Barin was deported to the Cellular Jail in Andaman in 1909 along with other convicts."
"Barin was released during a general amnesty in 1920 and returned to Kolkata to start a career in journalism. Soon he left journalism and formed an ""ashram"" in Kolkata. He published his memoirs ""The tale of my exile - twelve years in Andamans"". In 1923, he left for Pondicherry where his elder brother Aurobindo Ghosh had formed the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. He was influenced by Aurobindo towards spirituality and Sadhana. Barin returned to Kolkata in 1929 and again took up journalism. In 1933 he started an English weekly, ""The Dawn of India"". He was associated with the newspaper ""The Statesman"", and in 1950, he became the editor of the Bengali daily ""Dainik Basumati"". This time he got married. He died on 18 April 1959."

"""Residence may refer to various parts of English law including taxation, immigration, and family law. This article deals exclusively with English family law. See residence in English law for disambiguation."""
"In family law, the Court can order a Residence Order of the Family Court under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 following the breakdown of a marriage and determining where the children are to live and with whom. The order can be sole or joint, and if joint, it can be made to a couple regardless whether they are married. If a residence order is granted, this automatically gives him, her, or them parental responsibility for the child(ren) which will continue until the order terminates (usually this will be until the child(ren) reach their sixteenth birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a longer period)."

"If an applicant cannot apply for the Order as of right, (e.g. they are wider family members such as grandparents etc. who wish to seek orders for their grandchildren), they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court will consider, amongst other things:"
"As a matter of public policy, the courts have always operated under the doctrine of ""parens patriae"" to make the best interests of any children their first and paramount concern. From time to time, this doctrine has been included in statutes, the most recent relevant version being section 1 of The Children Act 1989 which requires the court to consider the ""welfare checklist"".

"A child is not automatically a party to the proceedings and will be represented by a Guardian ad litem unless the court considers it necessary. If a Guardian is appointed but the children and the Guardian do not agree on what recommendations to make to the court and the children are of sufficient age and understanding, they will be able to instruct a solicitor directly to represent their views and the Guardian will present an independent view to the court. Whether or not a Guardian is appointed, the court can request a Welfare Report under section 7 of The Children Act 1989, either from the local authority where the child currently resides or from a Children and Family Reporter who is an officer appointed by CAFCASS. The report will usually inform the court of the child's wishes and feelings, but the officer will recommend what he or she thinks is in the child's best interests in the circumstances of the case rather than just advocate the child's wishes."

A possible new utilization for crambe are biofuels since the oil composition is suitable for processing.
"Genetically, ""C. abyssinica"" has a set of 2n=90 chromosomes and is hexaploid. However, it shows low genetic variation in important agronomic traits, e.g. erucic acid content. Thus, improvement of cultivars through selection is difficult to achieve. A new source of variation could be found in the related taxon ""Crambe hispanica"". Recent efforts are found in the field of gene technology. To overcome the limited genetic variation, gene technology has been used in recent years to improve different important agronomic traits of crambe. Site-directed mutagenesis could be another tool for further improvement of the crop. However, the genetic control of many agronomic traits are unknown, thus the potential for genetic improvement is limited at the moment. Additionally further research aims to assess the potential of using the seed cake in protein-based plastic production and to find further uses for the whole plant."

"231st Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of West 231st Street and Broadway in the Kingsbridge and Riverdale sections of the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times."
"This station opened on January 27, 1907 as the 230th Street station, but was built near the site of the originally proposed northern terminus of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station. It was also near two former Kingsbridge railroad stations owned by two separate branches inherited by the New York Central Railroad; one was along a former segment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (now the Hudson Line), and the other was for the New York and Putnam Railroad (now abandoned)."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000."
"In 2002, it was announced that 231st Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. The station was extensively renovated in 2003–2004, which included installation of elevators for both platforms to make it fully ADA-accessible and replacing the exit-only turnstiles on the 242nd Street-bound platform with High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles ones, allowing both access and exit from that side."
"This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track that bypasses this station is not used in revenue service. This is the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line's southernmost station in the Bronx (Marble Hill–225th Street station is physically on the mainland of New York State, but legally part of Manhattan)."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and outlines in the center and green waist-high, steel fences at either ends with lampposts at regular intervals. The platforms are offset with the Manhattan-bound platform to the south of the 242nd Street-bound one. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering."
"There are two sets of artwork at this station. One of them was made in 1991 and is called ""Elevated Nature I-IV"" by Wopo Holup. It consists of gray marble tiles with a green border on the platform walls of the station house. It is also located at four other stations on this line. The other artwork was made in 2007 by Felipe Galindo and is called ""Magic Realism in Kingsbridge"". It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens depicting images of the surrounding area."
"Each platform has an adjacent same-level station house in the center. However, only the Manhattan-bound platform is open to the public. A set of doors from the platform leads to a small waiting area and a bank of turnstiles. On the 242nd Street-bound platform, a set of High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles lead to a passageway around the station house separated from the platform by a metal fence."
"Outside fare control on the Manhattan-bound platform, there is a token booth, two staircases going down to either western corners of 231st Street and Broadway, and one elevator going down to the southwest corner. Two emergency gates on the platform lead directly to each of the staircases.

"Strickland had libertarian, socialist and atheist ideas. His anti-British and anti-imperialist activities were widely reported in the English-speaking press, making him somewhat of a celebrity, while his wandering led him to be dubbed a ""gypsy."""
"Strickland believed he was the subject of assassination plots by the British. In a letter to a London newspaper, he wrote, ""The vulgar, ungentlemanly, and, indeed, murderous persecution to which I have been subjected is exclusively British."" According to British intelligence, Strickland was thought to be of ""doubtful sanity."""
"In 1909, Guy Aldred, founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group, was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour for printing the August issue of ""The Indian Sociologist"", an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma. Strickland heard of Aldred's action and sent him a telegram of congratulations at the prison and a cheque for £10. Several of his writings were published in ""The Indian Sociologist"" between 1911–14."
As related by Albert Meltzer:
"""After the publication of Hyde Park in 1938 support for Aldred in London fell off and he had burned his bridges in London and Glasgow, but then an extraordinary chance ended his days of poverty. Sir Walter Strickland, a millionaire whose family practically owned Malta, had during the First World War taken to him and was disgusted with the British Government after the Versailles Treaty. In acknowledgment of the newly created State of Czechoslovakia, the first fruits of League of Nations liberal idealism, Strickland became naturalised Czech (1923), though he never went to that country. In 1938 Strickland died and left a fortune to Aldred, who promptly formed the Strickland Press, bought a hall, bookshop and machinery and proceeded reprinting all his old pamphlets, before actually getting the money. Then the Strickland relatives brought a suit saying the will was invalid. Strickland had said in his will he left the money to Aldred ""for socialist and atheist propaganda"", illegal under Czech law. There was a complicated legal case which ended as such things usually do, with the money in the hands of the lawyers. Aldred, used to defending his own cases personally and handling courts with ease on matters of obstruction and sedition, found himself outgunned among the moneyed lawyers."""
"According to John Taylor Caldwell: ""Walter was an eccentric. He preferred books to the pursuits of normal young men of his class, and had no interest in sport, drink, gambling or women. His father was disappointed and disgusted. One day when he was having it out with Walter (probably not for the first time) about his unsatisfactory life-style, and the fact that he was nearing forty and still not married, Walter rose from the table and, so the story goes, proposed to the first girl he met, who happened to be the kitchen maid."""
"He gave Sun Yat Sen £10,000 ""to help him start a revolt against the Emperor of China."""

The Rough Guide to True Crime is a non-fiction paperback reference guide to national and international true crime cases by American crime writer Cathy Scott. It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by Penguin Books through its Rough Guides imprint.
"""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars. The book features serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, mob hitman Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski, John Wayne Glover ""The Granny Killer,"" and British ""Doctor of Death"" Harold Shipman."
"Scott's story from ""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" about mob enforcer Herbert Blitzstein was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, ""Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre""."
"The author appeared on BlogTalkRadio's ""True Murder"" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as ""a different time in America, where people like Billy the Kid could walk in and just rob a bank"" and get away with it. And while ""there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore."""
The book was featured at BookExpo America 2009's trade fair in DK Publishing's booth in New York City.
"In a review, ""True Crime Book Reviews"" wrote, ""From the Moors murders and Harold Shipman, to the murder of 2pac, this guide illuminates the psychology in play behind the most intriguing crimes in history, from the absurd to the appalling.

Kashubian Americans are Americans of Kashubian descent.
"The two earliest Kashubian American settlements in the United States were in the Winona, Minnesota area, including the towns of Fountain City, Pine Creek, Dodge, and Trempealeau across the Mississippi River in Wisconsin, and in Portage County, Wisconsin, including the towns of Polonia, Sharon, and Hull. The Winona settlement is traditionally dated to 1855, but actually began in 1859; the Portage County settlement can definitely be traced back to 1858. Winona is dubbed ""Kashubian Capital of America"", because of the largest population of Kashubians there."
"After the American Civil War and the German Kulturkampf of the early 1870s, Kashubians emigrated to the United States in much larger numbers. While some headed for the Winona area and for Portage County, many Kashubians wound up living in major urban centers such as Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee. A smaller number of Kashubians settled in small farming communities scattered throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana. By the turn of the century, Kashubian Americans tended to identify themselves completely as Polish Americans, although in Winona (at least) the Kashubian language would survive for another generation or two."

= = = Word superiority effect = = =
"In cognitive psychology, the word superiority effect (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings. Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. ""WOSK"") and pseudohomophones (e.g. ""WERK"")."
"The effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, ""I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters""."
"G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word ""card"", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as ""cqrd"". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word."
The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks.
"The WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope."
"A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if ""WOSK"" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether ""K"" or ""H"" had been in ""WOSK"". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. ""WKRG"") or single letters."
"The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind)."
"Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks."
= = = Clustered web hosting = = =
"Clustered hosting is a type of web hosting that spreads the load of hosting across multiple physical machines, or node, increasing availability and decreasing the chances of one service (e.g., FTP or email) affecting another (e.g., MySQL). Many large websites run on clustered hosting solutions, for example, large discussion forums will tend to run using multiple front-end webservers with multiple back-end database servers."
"Typically, most hosting infrastructures are based on the paradigm of using a single physical machine to host multiple hosted services, including web, database, email, FTP and others. A single physical machine is not only a single point of failure, but also has finite capacity for traffic, that in practice can be troublesome for a busy website or for a website that is experiencing transient bursts in traffic."
"By clustering services across multiple hardware machines and using load balancing, single points of failure can be eliminated, increasing availability of a website and other web services beyond that of ordinary single server hosting. A single server can require periodic reboots for software upgrades and the like, whereas in a clustered platform you can stagger the restarts such that the service is still available whilst still upgrading all necessary machines in the cluster."
"Clustered hosting is similar to cloud hosting, in that the resources of many machines are available for a website to utilize on demand, making scalability a large advantage to a clustered hosting solution."

"Well-known attendees and speakers included Governor General Michaëlle Jean, Stephen Lewis (the United Nations special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (for the Gates Foundation), Richard Gere, Alicia Keys, and Bill Clinton."
"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who decided not to attend the conference, was criticized by Conference co-chairman Dr. Mark Wainberg in his speech, saying, ""We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening...The role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends the message that you do not consider HIV/AIDS as a critical priority, and clearly all of us here disagree with you"". Canadian Minister of Health Tony Clement attended in Harper's place. Harper's absence from the conference is the second time the Canadian head of government has decided not to attend the conference. In 1996, former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien did not attend the conference."
"A second controversy, that followed Mr. Stephen Harper's choice to not attend, was the fact that 151 delegates who were in attendance refused to return to their home countries – instead opting to seek asylum in Canada. This development seriously hurt the credibility of the conference and many suggested that the Prime Minister's office may have been justified in its decision to not have Mr. Harper in attendance."

SR 107 turns north in South Montesano and crosses the Chehalis River into the city of Montesano before the designation ends at a diamond interchange with US 12, while the roadway continues north as Main Street into the city."
"Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 5,800 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Montesano area."
"PSH 9 was created with the primary and secondary state highways in 1937, including a branch that connects the main highway and US 410 in Montesano to US 101 and PSH 14 near Artic. The current truss bridge over the Chehalis River between South Montesano and Montesano was built in the 1950s alongside two other bridges in the area by the Department of Highways. SR 107 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering to replace the PSH 9 branch and was codified in 1970. The new highway was truncated to its current terminus, a diamond interchange with US 12, after Montesano was bypassed by US 12 in 1967.

"The Nelson Diversity Surveys (NDS) are a collection of data sets that quantify the representation of women and minorities among professors, by science and engineering discipline, at research universities. They consist of four data sets compiled by Dr. Donna Nelson, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma during fiscal years (FY) 2002, 2005, 2007, and 2012. These surveys were each complete populations, rather than samples. Consequently, the Surveys quantified characteristics of the faculty which had never been revealed previously, drawing great attention from women and minorities. Furthermore, the Surveys initially came at a time when these underrepresented groups were becoming concerned and vocal about perceived inequities in academia. At the time the Surveys were initiated, (1) the MIT Study of 1999, expressing the concerns of women scientists (including Nancy Hopkins), had just been issued, and (2) underrepresented minority (URM) science faculty noticed URM students increase among PhD recipients without a corresponding increase among recently hired professors. Because the NDS were complete populations, which disaggregated faculty by race, by rank, by gender, and by discipline, URM faculty had the documentation to support their concerns."
"The NDS quantified the degree to which women and minorities are underrepresented on science and engineering faculties at research universities. Because the surveys were complete populations and disaggregated, the degree of underrepresentation was revealed, in ways it had never been revealed previously. For example, the FY 2002 survey showed that there were no Black, Hispanic, or Native American tenured or tenure track women faculty in the top 50 computer science departments. It also revealed that there were no Black or Native American assistant professors in the top 50 chemistry departments. Analogous surveys were carried out for top 100 departments in each of 15 science and engineering disciplines in fiscal years (FY) 2005, 2007 and 2012."
"The Nelson Diversity Surveys made it possible for the first time to know the level and rate of faculty diversification, disaggregated by race, by rank, and by gender. Researchers in the 15 areas of science surveyed were enthusiastic to use these disaggregated faculty data, in order to compare against analogous student data, which had been available from NSF for decades. Many new programs to increase the representation of women and minorities among professors were implemented and PhD and MS research was based on data revealed by the NDS. The NDS were utilized by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, US Congress, Sloan Foundation, the National Organization for Women, universities, and many other organizations interested in diversity in academics. A new area of research was spawned – the Science of Broadening Participation."

"It was estimated that the Nation of Islam had at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility."
"The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center."
"The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to the ""Nation of Gods and Earths"" (NGE/NOGE) or the ""Five Percenters"", is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as ""Allah the Father""). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the black man was himself God personified."
"Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest."
"The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded in 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself ""Royall, Allah in Person""."
"After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time."
"W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire ""temple"" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the ""salat"", to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca."
"A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader."
"Although at first the India-originated Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's efforts were broadly concentrated at over large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the Civil Rights Movement. Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times."
"""Salafi methodology means that Muslims teach and understand the holy texts, the Qur’an and the prophetic Sunnah by learning Arabic and trying to live as closely to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) as possible. The early Salafis (the first three generations) are referred to as the righteous companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam). Of course, there are some state and federal laws where they must make exceptions, such as getting photos taken for identification purposes and basically obeying secular law. Most Salafis do not wish to participate in modern photography. It is considered haram, which means unlawful in Arabic."""
"Philadelphia has one of the largest concentrations of Muslims in the United States. Philadelphia's Germantown Salafi community is one of the most important, as their community is primarily African American and adherents to the Salafi methodology, according to the first three generations of Muslims. There has been an increase of authentic teachings of Islam in the United States over the past several decades to mitigate many misunderstandings, incorrect deviant sects and harmful, terrorist propagated teachings that are against traditional Islam as taught by the Prophet Muhammad (salalahu alahi wa salaam) and his righteous companions. The Germantown community has been one of the largest representatives of this effort. Teachings of correct Aqeedah (creed) and Minhaaj (methodology) according to the authentic prophetic traditions are their foundation."
"The Germantown community has a very Muslim feel with Muslim stores of various sorts. Anything from halal meat shops, clothing, authentic book stores and various Muslim businesses line the commercial corridor. One of the defining representations of the community is seeing Salafi Muslim women dressed in full length black Abayas and Hijabs, Salafi Muslim men wearing the Kufi (style of Muslim hat) mandatory beards and white Thobes (usually white lining robes) with pants underneath and above the ankles as a signature style for the community."
"Conversion to Islam is a practice which is common to African-Americans in prison. J. Michael Waller found that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. According to him, 80% of the prisoners who ""find faith"" while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority. Waller also asserts that many converts are radicalized by outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur it has little to no connection with these outside interests."

The western part climbs small hilltops, often with a beautiful view of the Trondheimsfjord. The eastern part is almost flat."
"There is lush vegetation along the track, with birch, pine, spruce, Rowan, alder, and hazel, the latter being very common in the western part of the track. In addition, sycamore maple, although not a part of the original flora, is rapidly spreading and is now among the most common trees.

"The Hall of Worthies, or Jiphyeonjeon (; ), was a royal research institute set up by Sejong the Great of the Korean Joseon Dynasty in March 1420. Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation. The Hall of Worthies is well-known for its role in compiling the Hunminjeongeum, the original treatise on Hangul."
"The Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press."
"The Hall of Worthies participated in various scholarly endeavors, one of which was compiling the Hunminjeongeum. Hangul was personally created by Sejong the Great, and revealed by him in 1443. Afterward, King Sejong wrote the preface to the Hunminjeongeum, explaining the origin and purpose of Hangul and providing brief examples and explanations, and then tasked the Hall of Worthies to write detailed examples and explanations. The head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, was responsible for compiling the Hunminjeongeum. The Hunminjeongeum was published and promulgated to the public in 1446."
"Confucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history. This compilation of works would become the book ""Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships"" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later."
"Besides contributing to the Hunminjeongeum and publishing the Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture."
"The Hall of Worthies was disbanded by King Sejo () after many of its members (notably the six martyred ministers) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong. However, a similar organization, the Hongmungwan (), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period."

"An eolith (from Greek """"eos"""", dawn, and """"lithos"""", stone) is a chipped flint nodule. Eoliths were once thought to have been artifacts, the earliest stone tools, but are now believed to be geofacts (stone fragments produced by fully natural geological processes such as glaciation)."
"The first eoliths were collected in Kent by Benjamin Harrison, an amateur naturalist and archaeologist, in 1885 (though the name ""eolith"" was not coined until 1892, by J. Allen Browne). Harrison's discoveries were published by Sir Joseph Prestwich in 1891, and eoliths were generally accepted to have been crudely made tools, dating from the Pliocene. Further discoveries of eoliths in the early 20th century – in East Anglia by J. Reid Moir and in continental Europe by Aimé Louis Rutot and H. Klaatsch – were taken to be evidence of human habitation of those areas before the oldest known fossils. The English finds helped to secure acceptance of the hoax remains of Piltdown man."
"Because eoliths were so crude, concern began to be raised that they were indistinguishable from the natural processes of erosion. Marcellin Boule, a French archaeologist, published an argument against the artifactual status of eoliths in 1905, and Samuel Hazzledine Warren provided confirmation of Boule's view after carrying out experiments on flints."
"Although the debate continued for about three decades, more and more evidence was discovered that suggested a purely natural origin for eoliths. This, together with the discovery of genuine early Lower Pleistocene Oldowan tools in East Africa, made support for the artifact theory difficult to sustain."

= = = Eight-legged essay = = =
"The eight-legged essay (, literally ""eight share text"") was a style of essay that exam-takers wrote to pass the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in these civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often focusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in innovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the eight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to write coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates were expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value was also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material. This was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it were better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the history of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have caused China's ""cultural stagnation and economic backwardness"" in the 19th century."
"The eight-legged essay is named so because it was divided into eight sections, which are ""breaking open the topic (破题)"", ""receiving the topic (承题)"", ""beginning discussion (起讲)"", ""initial leg (起股)"", ""middle leg (中股)“, ""later leg (后股)"", ""final leg (束股), ""conclusion (大结)."""
"The eight-legged essay format was invented in the Song Dynasty, by reformer and poet Wang Anshi (1021–1086), in the eleventh century. During the Song Dynasty, due to the invention of the printing press and the emperors' wish to recruit more men of talent, there was a huge boost in education and a consequent increase in the number of people taking the civil service exam. Additionally, there was a shift from a pluralistic ideology characteristic of the Tang Dynasty to a neo-Confucian ideology based on Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi's philosophy. The eight-legged essay came into existence under this background, coinciding with the shift in ideology and embodying the new orthodoxy."
"The essay format didn't become prevalent as a standard essay in the civil service examination until early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the composition of the essay was clearly specified. In the seventeenth century, Gu Yanwu stated that this form of essay-writing became standardized precisely during the 15th century, when the eight parts of the essay were determined. The term ""eight-legged essay"" formally appeared during the early years of the Chenghua Emperor's reign (1464–1487) for the first time. Then, it started to be required in civil service examinations in the 1480s."
"Since mastery of the form was a requirement for success in the examinations, commercial printers during the Ming Dynasty began to print successful examination essays as guides for aspiring candidates. The first of these appeared in pirated form during the 16th century, and the practice gained official approval in 1587, when the government suggested that the best papers of the previous century be reprinted as examples."
"There was widespread dissatisfaction with the eight-legged essay during the Qing Dynasty. In the beginning of the Kangxi reign, the state under the rule of the Four Regents issued an order revoking the need to use ""baguwen"" in all civil service exams, although the order was later repealed. The Qianlong Emperor said that he could not comprehend the eight-legged essays written by many exam-takers. The eight-legged essay was abolished in 1905 by the Guangxu Emperor. In total, the eight-legged essay was included in China's civil service examination for over 1,000 years and thus assumed a historically important role."
"Structurally and stylistically, the eight-legged essay was restrictive and rigid. There are rules governing different sections of the essay, including restrictions on the number of sentences in total, the number of words in total, the format and structure of the essay, and rhyming techniques. The requirement of length went from 550 words to 700 at one point."
"In terms of the content, the exam-takers were required to compose their essays under a pre-assigned title and rhyming word, around which they needed to rhyme their essays or poems. Writers were also advised to circumvent the use of offensive vocabulary and clues that can point to their identity or social status."
"The components of the essay were usually in a consistent format, although there were variations; in particular:"
"The following is a translation of an original eight-legged essay, written by Wang Ao (1450–1524), who was considered to be a master of the form."

"Campbell claimed he had been unfairly beaten and took the matter of his eligibility to stand as a candidate to court. However his protest came to nothing, and Fitzgerald was declared the first Superintendent of the Canterbury Province."
"Campbell's handling of land issues resulted in Governor of New Zealand George Grey receiving a large number of complaints about Campbell, as well as voluminous correspondence from him about colonists and run-holders. Campbell did not acknowledge James FitzGerald as superintendent and, despite repeated requests, refused to provide FitzGerald a return of revenue from land leases. Gerald Hensley points out that Campbell was """"maintaining with a splendid inconsistency that he had not received the Governor's dispatch instructing him to do so, even while quoting parts of it in his long and argumentative letters."""" During late 1853 there was a heated exchange of letters between the two men, into which Governor Grey was copied."
"On 5 October 1853 Alfred Domett, who was at that time Civil Secretary for central government, told Campbell that he was relieved of his commissionerships and that he was to hand over his records to William Guise Brittan, who had been appointed in his place (Brittan was already Commissioner within the Canterbury Block so this effectively amalgamated the two Canterbury Land Offices). Campbell was instead appointed as """"Registrar of Deeds for the Provence of Canterbury"""", replacing Brittan in this role."
"On 11 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council, apparently unaware that Campbell had already been removed from the land commissionerships (probably because Campbell took no action to relinquish office while he appealed to the Governor), adopted the following resolution agreeing to ask the Governor of New Zealand to remove Campbell from office:""""This Council, having taken into account the various papers upon their table in reference to the proceedings of the Commissioner of Crown Lands: resolve; That the Commissioner of Crown Lands, having as it appears to this Council, acted in disregard of the law, and having refused to afford this Council any information on the affairs of his office, and having otherwise shown himself wholly incompetent to the discharge of the duties thereof, an address be presented from this Council to His Excellency the Governor, praying His Excellency to be pleased to remove Colonel Campbell from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands."""""
"On 23 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council discussed Campbell's appointment as Registrar of Deeds. John Hall stated Campbell was """"even less qualified to be Registrar of Deeds, an office which particularly required to be filled by a person of business habits."""" The Council then adopted the following resolutions asking Governor Grey to remove Campbell as Registrar of Deeds and to combine registration of deeds with that of births, deaths and marriages in the same office under the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court:""""1. That this Council has learned with great surprise and regret that Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, after having been removed from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands, has been appointed as Registrar of Deeds for this Province. 2. That, considering how largely the interest of individuals may be affected by the Acts of the Registrar, and the extensive evil which may result from incompetence or mal-administration: this Council are of opinion that that office ought to be entrusted only to some person possessing the fullest confidence of the public. 3. The Council are of opinion that the office of Registrar of Deeds is one which ought, if possible, be filled by a person having a legal education, and that for the purposes of economy its duties might for the present be most conveniently performed by the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court.."""""
"Campbell refused to register any land deeds and, when the Provincial Council complained, Campbell """"denounced them as calumniators and prepared to sue the Superintendent and executive on an extraordinary variety of grounds ranging from usurpation to illegal absence from the province... [and] that the whole provincial establishment was illegal"""""
"In December 1854 (after George Grey had completed his first term as Governor of New Zealand) the central Government finally agreed to the removal of Campbell from office. The grounds for his removal were """"general unfitness for the duties of his office, willful and continued neglect of duty and a determined spirit of opposition and resistance to the Provincial Government, and disrespect towards its executive officers."""" Superintendent James FitzGerald appointed lawyer and court registrar Christopher Alderson Calvert as Registrar of Deeds in place of Campbell."
"Campbell went on to sue Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury James FitzGerald for libel on the grounds that he had been defamed in FitzGerald's letter to Governor of New Zealand George Grey while seeking Campbell's removal from office. Fitzgerald's letter to the Governor said """"I request the removal of an officer who has been condemned by the united voice of the public as wholly unfit to be entrusted with any public office whatever"""". Campbell initially won the case but the verdict was overturned on appeal on the basis that FitzGerald's letter to the Governor was privileged, that Campbell had not proven that FitzGerald acted in malice, and that Campbell had misstated the alleged libel."
"After removal as Land Commissioner Campbell is reported to have lived at Isabella (AKA Isabel) Lodge, an """"elegant and commodious house"""" located on Isabel Farm on Ferry Road, Christchurch, the property of Alexander 'Russian' Sherwood Jackson and his wife Isabella Mary Jackson."
"Campbell died in Christchurch aged 71, on 7 July 1858. The cause of death was stated as apoplexy He is buried with his wife at Barbadoes Street Cemetery Christchurch. Obituaries appeared in several papers."

= = = Nested neutron spectrometer = = =
"The nested neutron spectrometer (NNS) is a tool used for neutron spectroscopy. The NNS is used to measure the energy spectrum of neutrons in a neutron field. This type of detector is used in both research facilities (for characterization of neutron fields) and workplaces, where neutron radiation maybe encountered, for radiation protection purposes. Due to the difficulty associated with the detection of neutrons, the NNS is one of the few pieces of equipment capable of accurately determining the characteristics of a neutron field."
"The NNS operates under the same principle as a Bonner sphere neutron spectrometer. The sensitive part of the spectrometer is the Helium-3 proportional counter, which detects neutrons through the reaction He(n,p)H. This particular reaction has a significant cross-section only at thermal neutron energies. In order for a higher energy neutrons to be detected their energies must be decreased, or ""moderated"". To slow down neutrons at higher energies the NNS uses different amounts of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The He-3 proportional counter is surrounded by varying amounts of HDPE to sample various energy regions of the neutron field. The standard NNS has seven HDPE cylinders which are nested together, similar to Russian nesting dolls, to measure neutrons of higher and higher energies."
"Shown below are spectra of two standard calibration sources measured by the NNS. The measured spectra (blue) is compared to the ISO standard spectra (red). Both Measurements were made at the NIST low scatter facility in Washington, DC."
= = = Aerarium militare = = =
"The aerarium militare was the military treasury of Imperial Rome. It was instituted by Augustus, the first Roman emperor, as a ""permanent revenue source"" for pensions ""(praemia)"" for veterans of the Imperial Roman army. The treasury derived its funding from new taxes, an inheritance tax and a sales tax, and regularized the ad hoc provisions for veterans that under the Republic often had involved socially disruptive confiscation of property."
"The ""praefecti aerarii militaris"" (singular ""praefectus"") were the three prefects who oversaw the treasury."
"The Imperial biographer and historian Suetonius saw the ""aerarium militare"" as a response to the uncertainty of retired military men in need who might be inclined to support a coup or foment unrest. The professionalizing of the army during the Republic created the new problem of veterans, since earlier in Rome's history male citizens served short-term to confront specific threats or carry out seasonal campaigns, and then returned to their normal occupations. The solution in the late Republic had been to settle veterans in colonies in conquered territory, or on ostensibly public land in Italy that in fact had been used by the aristocracy for personal gain; the redistribution of this land by military commanders such as Marius and Pompeius was resented by the elite as a popularist currying of favor among the lower ranks of society. A state-supported benefit helped redirect the former soldier's loyalty from his immediate commanding officer to the Roman state as a whole. Under Augustus, monetary grants replaced land redistributions, and were better received by the upper classes, who nevertheless complained about new taxes."
"Augustus included the ""aerarium militare"" among the accomplishments in his ""Res Gestae"", the commemorative autobiography published posthumously throughout the Empire. In addressing the Senate on the subject, Augustus had stated his intention to provide for military personnel from enlistment through retirement."
"A soldier earned a one-time ""praemium"" or discharge benefit upon completing his service (sixteen years for the Praetorian Guard, twenty for regular duty in the army). At the end of Augustus's reign, the pension for a Praetorian guard was 20,000 sesterces ""(HS)"", and that of a legionary 12,000. In the 1st century, a legionary's retirement benefit would have amounted to about 12 years of service pay. The ""praemium"" remained stable until the time of Caracalla, who increased it to 20,000 ""HS"" for a legionary and a higher but unrecorded amount for a Praetorian guard."
"When the treasury experienced a shortfall, the emperor might avoid paying pensions by arbitrarily extending the length of military service, in a form of forced retention or ""stop-loss policy""."
"The ""aerarium militare"" was part of an Augustan fiscal initiative that was at first greeted with hostility. In 6 AD, Augustus capitalized the pension fund with 170 million sesterces of his own money, along with voluntary contributions from client kings and cities. The amount was insufficient, and after soliciting proposals on revenue enhancement from senators, all of which he rejected, he finally forced through an inheritance tax of 5 percent ""(vicesima hereditatium)"". Inheritances left to members of the deceased's immediate family were exempted, as were estates below a certain valuation."
"The other source of tax revenue for the military treasury—a sales tax of 1 percent on goods sold at auction ""(centesima rerum venalium)""—is less attested."
"The military treasury was located on the Capitoline Hill at the time of Nero, as attested by a military diploma dating to 65 AD. It is unclear whether it was a physical storehouse for coins brought to the capital in payment of taxes, or an office for paper transactions."
"The treasury was administered by three prefects ""(praefecti aerarii militaris)"", who were former praetors at first chosen by lot for a term of three years. Later they were appointed by the emperor. Their precise duties are unclear, though they were not charged with collecting the taxes. They may have served mainly to provide financial management and security. Each senatorial prefect was assigned two lictors and other staff, but the later imperially-appointed prefects had no lictors. (The lictor was an honorary bodyguard who was part of the civil service of Rome.) The change to appointment by the emperor may have been made as early as the reign of Claudius. The younger Pliny was a prefect of the military treasury appointed by Domitian."
