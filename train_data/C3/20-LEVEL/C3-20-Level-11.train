"Everyone was walking, you just  holding on your  like a  weren't you?"
Yeah.
"Thing tho , but that one where they had to knock people out  I reckon the least you looked  mm, the more casual you look, you get in."

Well  three C's  must be over the points then.
Right
Er
Not like that feller yesterday said that  really they can er  they can refuse if you get
Well yeah!
a di difference of their point stipulation
"Oh, yeah."
"and er  their gra , grade stipulation so  even if you got  three A's they can still refuse you."
"He said that  he said it doesn't happen in York, but it has happened in some places  you know."
"I could understand them refusing you if they'd asked for  say, a B in english and C in something else"
Yes.
"and you got D in English and D in so , although it may not be the point, or C."
Yes.
"Because  then you  you wouldn't  certainly up, be up to the standard would you?"
In that particular
No.
Mm.
er  particular thing.
"But I suppose  espec , like if you got really really good grades  you'd be  different to the group."
"You know, say if they wanted to get you three C's and you got three A's  shut up Sam!"
You could be lot  a lot different to the group.
The higher standard?
Yeah.
Mm.
Which might make it more difficult to teach.
"Yeah, I suppose it would."
True!
Would it make an effect?
Mm.
"You, you !"
Now you're being rude!
"Right, right."

That's what I like.
"No, you you put your own, David down there."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I think that, I mean they still got the different, if you're playing  like a shot"

What about the places you go to put eight or nine .

But you can.
You could have a  coming around every week and two  you don't get it.
"And you talk about buying them young, you can  got them, cos he knows  ."

Absolutely loaded isn't he Tone?
Who Alexandro?

Oh yeah.
"And he lives in this garage because  out there you get earthquakes, and when you get earthquake damage to your house the government will fix it."
They say yes you're allowed so much money to have your house fixed and they fix it.
But they only come when they're ready.
"And he's, he took all his stuff out because he thought er they said they were coming."
"Then they never turned up so now he's got his cooker and his sink, goodness knows what in his, in his garage."
Ooh.
And that's their next door neighbour?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ever so nice.
"Can't speak any English though, it's ever so funny."
"You just get in, have your tea, and Alexandro'll come round, come for a beer."
There's Tony look.
He ain't got no teeth now look.
Yeah.
Oh!

I'll try five pound of erm  that .
They need washing do they?
"I said, what's the point of having a judge  and the jury that says  ah?"
What do you mean?
"You know if someone goes  it's, gets taken to court  for say, a murder"
Aha.
what's the point of having the judge sitting up there when it's jury that's saying  whether it's
Well he has to  and the judge has
Oh I see.
But that's all?
"So he could, so much"
Well
to say  I'm committing

"Er right, just going back to the actual  er roadside interview, is that one on the  the B road, or is it the A?"
That's the one.
Er I was only going to propose to use four staff on that.
"Have a look at the, I think that's what we've done last time."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Have a look at the erm  we must have a count but  yes, have you got that report?"
Of the
Or have you given it back to me?
"Well no just the   oh, yes it might be on that but I  the early report"
the reports on the erm  surveys which were done
Did you give it back?
Yes I did.
Right.
Okay.
Okay so then
Well they give us an idea of what the flow was then anyway won't it?
Yes.
And I think you're right.
And the other thing
Oh
"oh we've put in a  making the interview forms, just having the  Welsh translation on the top."
"I was explaining to Jim how we could do that and it looked pretty straightforward so  or, or not."
It's
Have we got the interview forms?
That we used last time?
And like I went down for that one Monday.
Yeah.
"And erm, I knew he was going to prison."
It was for something that happened about five or six years ago.
"He was in a fight with these erm, squatters."
Really?
And it's taken all this time to come round.
"Yeah, yeah, and now it's come round"
Three years.
"Three years  er  three years, five years if he misbehaves, and Clayton,you say, eighteen."
Yeah
Two years if he's good.
Bloody hell.
"I mean, he's been into court but not for that long."
"It's more of a shock, because, yeah, I know, because nobody knew."
"We thought he would just get like a, a community service"
from Lee.
I don't know.
I didn't know from Lee.
"Jim phoned me up and told me, he was like upset."
"Oh, shit."
Oh dear.
"it's sad though, because"
What has his mates done.
We're collecting loads of things for him to keep him occupied.
"Like drawing books and that, and pencils,you buy him trains and stuff."
"What a waste of time, cos he'll only sell them for things he"
"Yeah, course he will."
"It's like, it's ge you know, he's really upset about it, but I'm just thinking"
Be different if you can do that.
Yeah.
"Yeah, he's really upset, I feel sorry for him, cos he's been upset about it, but"
"I mean I've got, I mean I don't mind this but  why shouldn't you do it?"
And my friend she looked about eighty
Yes I couldn't agree with you more
but she still looks old for her age.
Yes.
My best friend was your colouring and she always has a  rinse.
It's her husband.
"She said I don't mind going grey but, but Paddy objects because he says it makes him feel old."
Oh.
But the thing is
He' my colouring.
also as well when you're black and you touch it up black when you're old you look hard.
Yes.
They usually say go paler.
yeah.
They usually say go to chestnut rather than keep to black.
Mm.
Actually I wish I'd gone like this years ago cos you get
Yes.
you know much more fun than when you
You reckon?
"I don't know cos I've never been brunette, Jackie."
So I wouldn't know love.
"Oh yeah, I think, I think it's because I  I had that severe hair style  I think, you know I looked hard."
Well I was severe.
I had a severe style.
That's right.
You always had yours  didn't you?
The neat pleat mm.
Yeah that's right yeah.
Mm the neat pleat.
But it was lovely for parties with a black velvet bow and  sequins down the back.
Varying degrees is it?
Yeah Phillips usually put two of these on but  Right-y-o blast off.
innit?
That's a bit more like it.
Cor yeah.
ready
See those are cheap  sets we can probably buy them for about twelve quid apiece couldn't we?
Yeah  that's right.
"You can always get  twenty five quid off the trade    double your money, quick easy money."
Yeah.
That's not a bad  is it really?bit of blue perhaps  bit more like it innit?
Ooh.
"Cor, fair near jumps out at you."
Compared to what it was it's bloody brilliant innit ?
She'll be well pleased with that.
Yeah it was a big  over to the main  you know that
"and had a look at the, the  but  Right, whereabouts  down there"
Erm
Oh it's down there
That there
Ah
was really black.
Yeah.
That's that  actually I'll do I'll do th no I've just been round most of those.
I'll do this end as well I think  be on the safe side.
I've been right round the lot anyway so that's  jolly good.
"over a period of time can you,"
Yes that's it .
I think some do.
"Yeah,"
Did you say it's from out of town this one?
industrial estate  she lives down  somewhere.
So here we've got
This is less than one.
squared.
squared it gets smaller and smaller.
So that's going to be nought point four.
Mm.
So the gradient at that point is about two.
Erm what wh where were we  where did I say find the gradient?
Where X equal to three?
Yeah.
Sorry  something wrong that.
"So we'd be, oh, okay, that's good cos you can do it."
When X is three?
"So when X is two point nine, say."
"Two point nine, and then"
Y
when X  one see what Y is down here.
It was three point one.
"Don't forget you can look at this, Y equals X plus one times X minus one, which, when you see it that way tells you where it's going to, where its roots are."
Where it's going to cut the axes.
Yeah.
X  So there Y will be two point nine plus times two point nine minus one.
Right.
"Which is three point nine times nought point nine,"
Okay.
"But f we can, we can, we can save that to the end because  I think that was"
Aye.
confusing probably wasn't it?
"When we're doing it this way, we can forget about the, with this X, X two is going to be three point one squared"
Minus one .
minus one.
"This one is going to be two point nine squared, minus one."
"Well, they would have showed a wider picture of the actual picture, and apparently they take,co , the photographers had taken a baby away from it's mother  he's standing in the middle of a desert , and there's a picture of them with a baby and all these photographers  photographing it !"

Too tight across the shoulders so I'm gonna have to
Got me a large strap for it.

The only thing about er is that the Rotaract one tentatively mentioned about the .
Well that's it.
"I mean,th tha when we took it over we, we got that, cos people said well, you know, just dishing out the oranges wasn't  there should be something organized so Rotaract said they would do  we said we would give the money towards the prizes."
So that they wouldn't hate us.
"Well when er, the, the, the, there's two words, the charter, and what's the other word?"

"Thirty quid  it's gorgeous, I looked at it  she picked this one up, white, and I says don't like it"
Is that the one in

"No it's a baby shawl thing, you know, where you carry, to come out of hospital in"
Oh yeah.

You know what I mean?
And it's got like a hood thing.
"And you can put them in pushch er pram, sorry"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Well I got one of them and it's pure silk, pale green and white and with all lacy  I thought I like it."
Are you keeping that for all of them now?
Yeah.
That's your special one?
Yeah that cost us thirty quid.
Good God.
And er I says are you going out?
She says what on?
I says that.
"Says  no that's your money, you buy whatever you want for baby, I'll buy  she bought her one for eight quid and I says let's have a look at your one, yours are only eight quid I says, well how much were yours?"
"I says  thirty, she went"

I says yeah.
She says you
Ah.
And the caravan must be taken off within twenty eight working days.
Well I think it was taken off this morning.
"No, it's still there."
Cos I saw that er bloke in er  park landrover.
Oh you saw him that day didn't you?
Well they're moving and hunting caravans all the time Mark.
They're on the roadways
Yeah well he he said he said
"No I'm talking about I saw, actually saw that guy who's in our caravan"
Oh yeah?
in a landrover  with a  park bloke.
And all of a sudden three big juggernauts came into the camp and one of them was on the back of a truck.
They they they
Well er er sh
they took three off the site.
Did
She said she couldn't take it off.
"No, he"
Maybe it wasn't him then.
I just thought it looked like him.
He told me it was still there and that he'd been told he's got to write to them today  and they've got to get it taken off within twenty eight days.
Yeah.
"Cos she was trying to find a, a reason  or an excuse  to sue them for it."
She stated that.
Mm.
It's all on the thing.
Mm.
And he said how can they do that?
Is it in the law?
They don't break the law.
They can't afford to break the law.
No well
"Well I'm not bound to, no."
What?
Have a bath tomorrow.
Well you can have one .
"Good god, you can have one now if you want it."
I hope  you know I'd er  see he'll have to put the back seat of the car down into a van.
Shit I'm afraid in case those mattresses rip.
Mm?
Because they're so thin.
Well  I'll mend the buggers  for you .
And don't be afraid of a patch dear.
It's not that I'm afraid of a patch.
Are caravan sizes the same as everyday sizes?
"The beds, the big beds are."
The small beds aren't.
Well you can get erm two foot bunk beds nan.
Mm.
But they're not spring mattresses.
Mm.
Although what's on the bed is nice mattresses.
Oh what's  have you got his dinner?
Yes.
Oh.
"Bloody cheek, do him the world of good to go without for a day or two."
He won't eat it.
"Well that's it, he he"
It's treating him like a kid of  five or six year old isn't it?
He forgets that he
Well the thing is he doesn't have a dinner every day of the week.
It won't hurt him.
Lots of people don't have one at all.
And then he looks forward to the weekends and that.
yes straightaway.
I was thinking
How's that?
"that's because of the Mozart, not you."
"In highlighted pen that you know  so when he goes out with someone in ninete , in two thousand he'll say to someone  the last time I went out with someone was in nineteen ninety three."
It's sad isn't it?
"But I felt sorry for him, I did, but that was my immediate reaction that"
Has he got a good voice?
Yes.
He's a good singer?
Mm.
He is.
Well he's obviously musical if he's  involved in E M I as well.
Mm mm.
"But he can be, he's very, perhaps a bit bossy in it, and erm  may, maybe bitter I feel."
Doesn't have a very good sense of humour.
Mm mm.
"I don't think anybody should go out with someone on their own  in the beginning, I really don't."
"Do you not, Gearoid."
No.
Not nowadays.
I don't care what anybody says.
Whether it's two
Yeah.
guys  or two women
Mm mm.
"or anything, I really don't think anyone  should put themselves in that position."
You're better off going out as a threesome or a foursome
Yeah.
Yeah but if you get asked out
but until you
"for a date, you're not going to say can I bring my friend?"
They just
left a broken bottle
clean cut right down the bone
Oh god
"so, he's out of commission for a couple of weeks."
"Yes, it's er infection really isn't it?"
Yes
And if he's anything like this guy he's all go
Oh yes he's just like him
"E T will you give over, come on"
You don't lE T them do you?
It's a bit
"He was ill treated you know, and he was"
Yeah
"we got him from the rescue, animal rescue you know"
Oh yeah
"so he's a pa , he's a bag of nerves really, but er, most of the time he's great, but,I think your, your one's a bit too boisterous for him"
Well enough.
"Take care anyway,come on E T"
"That's right, yeah, yeah."
Oh he said er
Oh that's not so bad you see I've been on holiday all last week
"Oh, where you been?"
"I haven't been away, but I've been off work like"
"Oh just, oh I see"
so er

"Yeah called me in two days so they gave me today and tomorrow off as well, so it's sort of gone longer than I expected you know?"
"Mm, mm"
I'm off tomorrow as well.
Well it's always nice to be at home isn't it?
Please yourself
What do you mean I shouldn't be there?
Oh I'm really sorry.
What sort of car do you drive round in?
What would you think I drive round in?
I'll I'll make a point in looking out for ya.
I've got I've got a huge a huge turbo Bentley with a great big whale stuck on the front.
Oh right.
And Andy  written down the back if you want to scratch it.
Oh well no I won't do that I'll just drive round at five mile an hour in front of ya.
You do that anyway.
Oh no no be fair it's fifteen usually.
Is it?
Er all these people gawping at everything.
I if I was a building the last thing I would want would be people gawping at me.
Well where does all the revenue come from into York?
Int I don well not from you lot does it?
Oh she's
Aha.

Aha.
Salaries and holidays and that thing.
"And ma , make you pay your pension book this year."
Mhm.
Just ask the old girls to make their  and say well I want your National Insurance numbers?
"Now, now where is that?"
"I say, it's on your pension book."
Is it?
I didn't know!
I know  mine off by heart.
Do you?
What your National Insurance
Do you?
And what are you saying it is now?
Fifty eight pound a day.
That's an awful lot more isn't it?
Yeah.
There's  I mean so many of them have caught on.
"Jan for example, when we had the  the town hall thing, that was five pound a day."
Yeah.
It's twenty five pound a day now.
I think they've just all jumped on the bandwagon.
They don't provide anything really do they?
"Well no, that's it."
So as soon as she said that it was in use Monday Wednesday I sort of
If we went to
subconsciously ruled it out.
"village hall, church hall"
Yeah ?
"which is a church hall, they don't have a charge, you have to make a contribution."
Where's this sorry?
"Well you, you need to, it's pretty grotty, it's a grim place"
Mm.
but it's er it's the church  the parish hall  in .
Whether they've got tables and stuff like that I'm not sure.
Mm.
If you ring Roger
Yeah
and ask him.
He  did investigate having a public enquiry there last year.
And erm  so he will have a phone number of the vicar and so on.
Mm okay.
Okay.
"I mean in a w well  I can't, did we, I wonder if we recharge this to the Welsh Office or not?"
We probably do.
I'm so confused about what's going on.
I think I must be not looking at the list or not reading half the stuff.
"The first  Who put  dictation and and I was going, What?"
Where did it say that?
I shan't find the le You know the letter we got sent in the holidays?
Yeah.
Well mine got sent home and I wasn't there I was here.
"Oh that's ridiculous Sarah, yeah"
So
So I don't know.
I I mean I've got I've read it once and and now I've lost it
"and it might even still be at home but I don't know where it is, I can't find."
So I can't remember what it said in it.
Ooh I don't know.
my supervisor doesn't know anything about writing an outline .
Yeah has that got to be in tomorrow?
Yeah.
Got to do a marathon tomorrow.
Why?
Cos he's a runner.
"Oh excellent,?"
put the history of phonetics
Yeah.
so  little blue brochure and
This is the  study of papers written in the fifteenth century or something
History of phonetics?
I'm sorry if you're interested in this then go for it.
You need a
What're you doing for yours then ?
I'm I'm I'm a bit confused.
Your doing what?
Historical linguistics?
Oh yes I'll have them c gotta have them done.
And and probably said they'd maintain the thing for her  at a price.
Well at a price yeah.
I mean  they don't do nothing for nothing.
No of course not.
"They're out to get money, aren't they?"
It's their living.
"But when we had these things through for the chassis and the cleaning of the caravan, it was all optional."
"If I, if you wanted to go down there and scrub the van out, you go and scrub it out."
You go and do it.
And it saves
And I will next year.
it saves thirty five pounds.
Mm.
"But for that thirty five pounds  the carpets are shampooed, the seats are shampooed, the lot."
Were they in today?
What?
The men?
Darren was there.
Oh he was the only one.
Yeah.
Cos there was two
He come to see
two workmen went by.
"Yeah, further down."
"I even went, I was dying to go to the toilet  so I thought oh I'll go down to the big er  and I had no toilet paper  so I'll go down to the big toilets and shower rooms."
They're all locked.
Everything's locked up there.
Everything's locked there.
There's toilet paper in the caravan.
No.
Not even the holder it was on.
We do.
Yeah.
B E S?
Well  you told me
I mean come on it's the same ball game.
Yeah.
I mean I
"It is the same ball game and, and as far as I, as far as I'm concerned it makes more sense"
So why aren't the Q S
for
B E S work now?
And P Way work?
"And P Way work cos that's what you've said it does and you, you're"
We are doing.
I'm afraid I'm not helped much
We are doing.
"I'm, I'm gonna call a halt to this here because without David  here who"
Right.
"knows the detail we, all we're gonna do is enjoy the sound of our own voices."
I think.
"So what I'm, what I propose, is that this goes out because I don't think it changes anything significantly."
"Erm Jim you, you, you need to present it in a certain way to your staff, and er after you've considered that, if you don't feel it's workable then I think you need to talk to David and I."
Yeah.
"Well I've already, for a number, a number of cases, spoken to Dave about it."
And he knows this can't be worked.
That's why
Well I
"I'm rather surprised that it's, we're"
Will it work?
still perpetuating this
Well alright then.
The other option
Not tonight we won't.
There's not gonna be any more time.
Go put those away please.
Off you go.
Right.
Now you said you were gonna tell me what's happened on the news so far.
Three people have er been killed in a railway accident after their  their car  ran into the side of a train.
Oh dear!
Wh which is about er  which  is about er  open  er  the day after tomorrow.
What's open  the day after tomorrow?
The level crossing.
Oh it's closed now is it?
"No, they're going to open it."
It's new.
Aha.
What else has been happening?
And dad?
Yes.
You know that many level crossings are one barrier?
Yes.
Well that  they showed us er  a thing about  the speed about  about the traffic approaching lights when they're  starting flashing.
"It showed you a car go over that, going over,tha a lorry going over crossing and the lights were starting to flash."
Well a lot of people do that.
It's very dangerous.
But I was supposed to stop.
They ha as soon as the lights flash supposed to stop.
Be
What the running of the railway line?
"No, they're supposed to stop before the lights."
Silly!
Yeah.
"Because, on a lot of those the train"
Oh aye you said you did didn't you?
"But she said I hate that place, I'm not going."
And stayed in bed.
"I made her a cup of coffee, she went to sleep."
"Hey now for the past three mornings  I've got up out of bed, I've made you a cup of tea every morning and breakfast on a tray, so don't you come complaining to me."
Only cos you beat me up.
Pardon?
Only cos you beat me up.
What!
It's me who's brought your breakfast to you.
Yeah.
"But if I'd've, if I'd've been up I'd've got it."
You don't bloody well have to.
It takes me half an hour to kick you out of bed.
Well
Answer that one.
Do you want a cig?
"Don't give him one, he smokes too much."
"You smoke too much, do you want a cig?"
Go on then.
I'll be kind to you.
Why are you picking on me?
"We're not picking on you we're just trying to get a conversation going here like, but it's very hard when you just sit there and say nothing."
No ta
Oops.
"Always picking on me, always beating me up."
Oh God.
No it's alright
I'll go if you want.
I quite enjoy it.
You're a sado-masochist you.
"You know I love you, what more do you want?"
Rocket has got one on his ear.
I
Oh.
"And when he went for his injections I said to the vet can you snip that funny little growth and he said oh we'll wait until he's under, complete anaesthetic and then, it's only a little wart he said."
",."
I didn't like it .
"take her and the, and the vet said the same, where that place is er a bad, a couple of years ago she had erm tick"
Yeah.
we took her up to Norfolk and I think among the sheep
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
and she had a tick and we took her to the vet
Hold on.
"And, and,and gave her an injection, and that,wart at."
So many .
"Oh how strange, good morning."
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hello Maxie
Max.
Max come on.
"But there's also another little one I've noticed, I just under her eye"
Yes.
"er, with  ."
Doesn't bother her does it?.
"No, no, she's not worried, but when we took her up recently, he, he, he said it's only a wart like that, he didn't sort of worry"
"Mm , mm."
and when the hair goes over it doesn't notice much.
"No, you can't really see the one on Rocky's ear at the moment, you can in some lights."
"When ya, when ya, when you're grooming him you can."
And that's happened just recently has it?
What was she wearing?
it was sponsored.
I read it in the
Black and white.
paper and thought   well that would have been quite nice.
Mm mm.
Did you go with him?
I'll come to that.
You said yes did anyway.
"I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it  until he stuck to me like a limpet"
for the rest of the  concert and  the penny began to drop  erm  He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet  and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something.
Mm mm.
"And then he said er, I said to him about"
I've got to get the last train home.
"He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable."
He's a train spotter.
He's got a green anorak with toggles
I see.
on.
And
I think it's better
Don't!
Alright.
He's tall but
he's tall which is great.
No problem.
He's in his  well actually probably pushing forty at this stage.
"But, he's got  he's got a a big round red face  and little eyes"
"and a moustache, and the most peculiar little  bit under"
"Bit, yes."
there.
But really it's just like
Well I shouldn't think so because
Mum!
they're not gonna want to know!
They don't belong there.
Yeah.
"and you can't complain to th , the Chamber of Commerce because  if they show this up too much"
Temby's  gonna lose a lot of trade!
I don't want
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean
"They have their, their"
I said to him we've been conned!
I said we've been stitched up!
That's how I look at it!
I was furious last week!
"Mm, so I ju , I was just trying to find, but you see, there again you're new people, we found new people last week didn't we."
Yeah.
He wasn't happy  that man.
"He bought a big caravan, he was very unhappy!"
There we are!
The way they do
"No, but these caravans"
Should you carry on?
"I don't know, is it here or over there?."
"So you see, this is only way you can  them!"
"Get to a situation where you've had a caravan before  and to make any money to pay, you've then got to  buy another caravan  to subsidise that one  and you seem to be  it's sort of"
like a chain all time.
Mm.
Yeah.
And the profit you've had from one is paying the expense of the other!
"Tha , if you're lucky!"
"Crumbly, is it?"
"I got it from, I don't know, I got it from Holston's and I haven't had any from there before."
I went into that Roberses the delicatessen part
Mm.
"and er  they were queuing up there so I couldn't be bothered  standing in the queue, so I didn't."
Didn't get it from there?
I didn't stay there for that.
"Mm, that's distinctive isn't it  the smoked one!"
Mm.
Very nice!
I haven't had  this  particular one before but we used to get  a little used to be able to get it in little  about
Yeah.
"tha , that big  and er  no, I expect the"
"It's on    don't, they reckon they can make Cheshire anywhere now can't they?"
"No, it's not what it used to be."
There must be somebody who can get it?
Get what?
Cheshire cheese is not  necessarily  indigenous to Cheshire now.
"Oh  what,wha"
They make it in lots of places.
you mean it's been made in Devon
No
and called Cheshire cheese?
"Well I don't know about Devon, I'm not sure."
"No, I I do , I think it's erm"
Only made in Cheshire?
I would have thought so.
You mean they're using the recipe somewhere else?
Yes.
Oh.
Making and you
I don't think so.
I still haven't a clue of what er the
"the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me."
She's like that.
"I mean, she's really sweet."
Mm mm.
I'm very careful never  to admire things or enthuse about things.
Because she's likely to give them to you?
Because she's likely to give them to you.
"I mean, she knows I love Gardenia"
Mm mm.
and because she was in  Mustique  and hadn't bought me a birthday present  she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me.
Really?
She's like that.
Mm.
She knows we love the pink champagne.
Mm mm.
The brand is in.
And it's not  kind of standard champagne in the place  but she always keeps a supply.
Always has champagne.
Got any champagne at home?
Get another bottle of that.
He must be running low.
"You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks."
"At least you know, she can be generous and"
Yes.
But she can be absolutely demonic  there's no doubt about that.
She really can.
Mm.
And she drives you insane!
"Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her."
Mm.
That's probably why she got through so many women.
Mm
that you could use
Okay.
and erm  er that's what I used if you want to borrow that you can.
Thanks.
"And do it in pencil and just, and then we can  rub it out"
yes.
"and change things and so on, yeah."
Well it's easy to change isn't it?
Because presumably Peter will need to incorporate that  in an overall programme.
When we look at the highway side.
So it's just the traffic side which I'm dealing with here?
Yes.
Cos that's all I'm dealing with.
Okay and perhaps erm  perhaps you'd also like to l would you like to look at this side of things as well?
Incorporate that into it?
"No, the, the layout plans, do, do some layout plans."
Oh yeah sure.
Marty's done them before you see haven't you?
Yep.
"So I'm, I'm just trying to look at the ones for   and then we'll go from there."
"Okay, is that alright?"
Yeah.
"Now, have I given either of you task schedules for this"
No.
stuff?
So  I need to do that don't I?
Er  in fact I never gave  telephone call  it's no good telling me to do something
"Task schedules,ooh   I'll have to get the form."
"Okay, so you want a task schedule for doing  doing the traffic report?"
Mhm.
Mm yeah?
Yeah.
"Oh, it didn't give you much chance then to get used to it did it?"
I mean you know
No.
"I just, I just got seven films and I said well if they  Friday if I don't, well"
Well they worked good didn't they?
"There's some that are a bit, you know"
"No, they're, they're alright."
They're nice.
They're good photos they are.
This reminds me of when we went round Versailles.
That's all painted ceilings and
Yeah.
"This is like in a big glass case and it's  other parts , there's like a little bit there looks like the nativity and then the rest is all parts of Naples in olden times."
It shows you the
Ooh.
the .
"And you walk round this glass case, it's all different"
"But the curtains, it says please don't touch, if you touch them they'd fall to bits, they're that old."
Yeah.
"Oh yeah, Tony was saying."
They're hundreds of years old aren't they?
Yeah.
"And look this, this room, you've got the  it was all like this, all gold filigree, it was all over."
Yeah.
"The ceilings, all down the walls  furniture."
Ooh it was
It was it was the er the throne room wasn't it?
"Throne room, yeah."
It was wonderful.
Mm.
And that's
You doing the bottle banks?
who's doing the bottle banks?
Yeah.
Thanks ever so much.
Because er  Caroline  once wanted one in a school and we weren't allowed to have it.
No I won't thank you.
Well there's one at erm  .
The erm wine merchant.
You know erm the one down the bottom of Thorley Hill.
"Well they were, they were sort of  advertising er  giving you money back."
. I don't know if
Down in the er
Yeah.
Can you find out more ?
And also we do
quite a few we can write at the bottom  er for more inf if you have any more information or something in small print
Mm.
please contact and then  we can do the next few hundred
"The thing is you can, you can change them very easily."
Ya.
That means you can er pay for it easier.
I wouldn't print more than three hundred for a start.
So if we get further information we can always  if not we can just get printed.
That's very impressive isn't it?
That's that   council of environment .
No sorry.
Council's environment advisory committee.
Oh that must be that must be the one  er
Rob's on.
"Thought this was good about the, buying the R S P C A that boat  oil spill."
Doesn't look very steady though does it!
Yeah they look like!
Why?
Because  how does M Mark know?
"Mark right, he's got up this morning and he's gone to Tenby."
And he's gone to look around Tenby.
While he's gone those men have gone in there.
That's what I mean.
He can't be standing there watching the bloody thing all the time.
No.
But he could put a note on it.
Please leave this fire on.
Please do not touch this fire.
Well they've got to haven't they?
To disconnect the gas.
Oh I thought it was water problems.
Gas.
A gas water heater!
Oh.
They've gotta disconnect the gas to get the water heater off the wall.
And fix it to the
Well Mark will be back there tonight and he can switch it on when he comes home.
Make it his responsibility.
Oh you don't understand!
In the meantime  the men have took the water heater off the wall.
"They've put it from that wall, and they've stuck it on to this wall."
Oh let's connect it up  see if it works.
Now in the meantime there's gas seeping through that fire there with no light.
Oh.
So you've blown your caravan.
"Well then again, there's Mark and Sally."
You could take the mattresses and put them in their caravan in the spare bedroom.
Is there a spare bedroom?
Well no.
And not bother about .
"I mean charity shops erm  library, hairdressers, surgeries  Boardman as I know"
I think that's a very sensible idea actually rather than er trying to do the whole town.
Because that was er you know  I mean it got the group together
Yeah
I thought because everybody had the same experience.
I liked the experience because I had never done it.
Mm.
what a waste of time.
The number of people I've talked to that  I definitely knew had got  and never knew they had got it.
Mm.
Yeah I mean but on the other hand the there's probably quite a few that  did read it.
I mean I know when we moved house  I had  folder and one of each had got in it the recycling directory
Mm
which is  quite a nice surprise!
I mean had they had they sold to someone outside Bishop's Stortford
Yeah.
then they could
Yeah.
Erm
I think we have to have something if we have a stall.
We lost all the erm  cartoons   original cartoons.
Yeah.
Oh that's a shame.
Well I could photocopy that couldn't you.
Yeah.
The detail
difficult to see what it is.
But erm
Oh that's a real shame.
"Otherwise I will just do it in a different colour, a different"
I mean then
I know they said it.
I heard them.
But a new caravan starts from eleven thousand eight hundred.

"As X becomes a very very very small number, or a large negative number, if you like to think of it that way, where X is very large."
"So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one."
Mm.
Any idea what that graph would be?
X squared.
"Erm, what would   not quite the right shape   what would that graph be?"
Y equals something  plus X squared.
"Right, there'd be some X squared in it."
"And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant"
Mm.
Yeah.
cos when X is zero still there's Y has still got a value.
So that's going to be minus something
Mm.
so it's about minus three.
X squared  cuts
the X axis in two points.
Two points.
This one
Three points.
It's
So?
X cubed.
"So this is, there's going to be an X cubed term in here somewhere, and there might be X squared and Xs and anything else, but if it cuts it three places, it's got three r three roots."
So it's X cubed.
What about this one?
I have to sketch curves  This sort of thing.
Just touches.
Y equals X squared.
"Something like, it's going to have an X squared in it somewhere."
"It's a bit lopsided, but it's"

Almost hardly worth their while but
If you look at the tonnage kept out of the landfill
Yeah.
it might work.
"Yeah, but I mean it it"

That's correct.
dimensions then you cube it.
"We're gonna do cubing in a minute, do a few exercises on cubing."
"Yes, I mean,Je Mandy said er, if we've got any consignment which exceeds one point five cubic feet per ten kilos."
But you usually know don't you if
It's lower than that actually but  er sorry
Mm mm.
it isn't.
"I, I said, yeah a cubic foot, is se , six point six then."
"That's probably right, yeah."
One point five per ten kilos.
"You can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute, but  when the mass seems greater overly large to the weight is what  er Jen , sorry Mandy said, and I think that's a good  er er  a good er  analogy there."
"I got if erm, if the size is greater than the weight actually."
Yes.
I got that.
I'll accept that at this stage alright?
"Next question is, what's number six?"
Who can read it out?
Er six .

"We'll read them through and pause for a while and try to think of the, also in terms of the physical, you know, erm  staging."
"Erm  okay, who's gonna be Face?"
"I'll have  Jo as Face  I'll have Monica as  Sottle, and we'll have  Mia as Don."

"Oh, that's a good idea  I hope we can get out at the ."
"Have you stuck a poster , you haven't, in the back window"
"No, I haven't"
I think more people see the back coming up that way than they do the front window
Yes
but I'll stick one in the back as well
Hope I've got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
"Oh, I haven't got my purse."
Oh brilliant.
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house .

Give me the key please.
Thanks.
Oh
Yellow flag coming out of his aerial.
Oh where would you prefer your ae aerial?
Would you like it there  up there or at the back?
Up there's alright.
"I like it the way the ones that you can  close each time, now I'm sure my aerial will last longer."
Cos you can
What do you mean close.
Well it compacts.
Oh yeah.
"The ones that stick out all the time, they  I suppose that is good."
"If you have one that doesn't compact, you you're best to have one in the middle cos it's less likely to get pranged there isn't it?"
Yeah.
Here like walkers by can bend it and  Oh look.
Here's my next one.
Six.
I've let six go now.
You must have let someone go before now.

Yeah.
It's only for junior rugby though.
They haven't replaced that garage have they?
"little dollops all over, and there's one spot, little"
Well why doesn't he put bloody newspaper there?
"No it does all over the place, wherever  put newspaper down, he does it on the carpet  so  kept doing it by the cooker so we put newspaper down there, and put the toys away, see they was in the way you see, put newspaper down there and then next   wouldn't have that,."
Ooh God!

"What we did last night, stop for a chicken  on the way over there."
Where did you get the ?
Wahhhh !
Well last weekend I bought a
No go like that

Yeah.
on the way home cos I bought a tenner for that  for forty quid.
And all the money went in the bank.
"You, you !"
So I got  in my leg.
Don't know where to go though  don't know where the best places are  don't know where they are.
Mm.
And she said that everything was mouldy  in er  you know the  even the curtains were mildew!
And how did she put salt round?
Because this is a hell of a lot damper today  than what it was when I had the salt about you.
you  but er  some people
Course not!
Yes.
Well I'd never heard of salt being put down before!
"But she  yes, she told me that in all, in the shop."
In the reception.
"She said, put it"
"Yeah, well"
down.
"yeah, these might tell you but  I always heard that salt was damp!"
Yeah but it attracts the
The
water in
the
"the air, into the salt!"
"and of course, once it's in the salt, it's steams!"
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Well that's common sense when you think about it isn't it?
"You put, you put a drop of water on it  you put er  a bowl of salt  and  that will go down  eventually!"
Mm.
If the air is damp.
It's collected the water .
"Once that's damp, that's rising the steam!"
So how else do you keep it dry?
"She said, straight to me now!"
"I said that caravan is soaking wet, I said!"
The mattresses!
"It'll be awkward getting cars in and out, when you know, with one more to be out and, all these cars in road, like, but."
That's the only difficulty.
"You'll probably end up say, leaving one on road all night."
Yeah.
"Don't hurt  I mean,"
"Oh, not leaving one on bloody road"
"Well, we could put 'em at night time, it's just through time, if one backs in, comes in behind other."
Yeah.
"It's a one way street and all ain't it, that makes it worse."
Why does it make it worse?
"Well, we don't have to have a problem, do we?"
"No, but I mean."
"It's like barbed wire, I mean that's, Sasha come in 'ere."
"What backs onto that bungalow, Karen."
Another 'ouse.
Another 'ouse.
Another 'ouse.
"Er, I told you what backs onto it, you know the right small on , what you were going to see that time, but on the side."
Yeah.
"We went to see that,"
Oh.
That's what backs onto it.
Oh.
"well, at least they won't be looking int' bungalow will they, with it all being down,"
No.
and that.
"Yeah, that's straight behind it."
Oh.
"Not like them, I mean, they can see straight into our"
"I'm not sure, but I think it was Mr  that had that bungalow built."
You know Mr
Yeah.
But there is something about you that is a bit different to  politicians.
Apart from that but Well th that's true that's true .
Trouble.
Trouble.
And you've had plenty of that.
Plenty of trouble.
And yet you keep bouncing back or
Yes.
swinging back.
"I mean, er"
"I wrote a book called, Where there's a will."
Precisely.
You resigned over over Westland you er er you were defeated for the leadership.
"You've had your heart attack, you've been out of action for three months and yet, when you talk to people, when the pollsters go out with their clipboards, they say, Who do you think is most likely apart from the Prime Minister, to lead the Tory party?"
"And they say, you."
Still.
So what is it about you?
Trouble.
It's got to be a bit more than that.
Ambition ?
Long hair.
"Long hair, tall."
You know.
Been around a long time.
"Erm I  what is it, who knows, who cares?"
"You know, if I'm president of the board of trade, I'm a loyal member of John Major's cabinet."
I intend to go on doing that as long as he wants me.
And the inevitable qu you'd expect me to ask this to you.
"If John Major fell under a privatized train, would your hat still be in the ring?"
Or
Well
"would you say, I've had it all now, I do"
I thought it was you?
No.
No.
"He and, erm a the other bloke are still there."
"The chap who tried to call, the one watching it?"
"Behind, yep."
"Yeah, he's still there."
I was gonna say er  somebody told me that he'd left and I thought it was you cos nobody would .
"No, he's still here."
"I got it wrong, yeah."
"Yeah, could have been me Marg."
Could have easily been me.
Do you think you'd better aim for the winter now?
"I would, definitely."
Yeah.
"Personally, maybe we just"
Did I tell you what's happened?
They sent you all notes on
Well it's quite naughty
and then you won't
cos Goodwood's sorted isn't it?
"you'll expect that they  The coach was burnt out down in Beatmore , if you remember  and then the  the police  took them August there"
"Di , no,th October."
police took him in that night cos they thought he'd burnt it out himself.
"And it's taken all this time, it's gone to court and all the rest of it, and they haven't got a case."
"So, they couldn't do anything in the meantime."
I should think
Well they
that was genuine.
the banks wo wouldn't let me have extra money or anything like that.
Oh!
They're trying to get somewhere now  with the police but  it could have happened anywhere!
that's alright.
Yeah.
Plus.
"I wish I was doing more hours, though really, cos like, I got to take the whole day for it,"
Yeah
I might as well
"might as well be there, till later, yeah, I know what you mean."
"I mean, just for three hours."
Do they give you anything to eat there?
No.
"they don't seem to give you any, you seem to have as much tea and coffee as you want, or soda water."
Lemonade.
Lemonade.
Or lemonade
Really?
"It's all on draught so er, they have stocks and that."
"But I mean, my dad always invites his staff to have a drink at the end of the evening and I mean, most of them have already been bought a drink during the course of the evening, anyway, so they're entitled to it."
"But erm,."
"So er, I think, I think like, it depends who you're working with as well."
"Think like, some of them, take"
Yeah.
sort of
"Yeah, there."
"What ones can I take then, Rebecca?"
"Oh,well, let me have a look."
"I don't think you'll find anything in that, you can have that."
What's it for?
"They call it word book, and every week,"
Yeah.

About Senna retiring.
"Oh, you saw the first"
I want to see all the exciting bits I missed.
"Well, won't they have highlights on later?"
This is the highlights.
"You mean, they didn't show the full race?"
The full race was run at some obscure time today so
When I listened to the six o'clock news

"No, oh  do I ever?"
They said it was half way through
"Yes, well that's a"
at the six o'clock news.
"well, yes sh yes well, this, well this was only the highlights unless the last two or three, no the last two or three parts have been live."
"Yeah, on the six o'clock they said it was half way through and Nigel Mansell was the lead and I thought you were watching it live, so I wouldn't just come through and"
Mm mm.
Right.
"Chrissy go outside and shake the grass off you now please, off your back."
David!
Oh yeah
"but she said, oh she said, they and that, they rented the horses that go up and down you know"

"Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!"
"I bet, I bet  he's scared"
"I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards."
You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way.
So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
"Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive!"
"Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site!"
We wasn't aware it was there.
"Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!"
So all  ?
"We were going , we were in!"
We're in!
We're in!
Oh good I'm in Majorca

Yeah we're all bored
The meeting's closing just before ten thirty thank you.

So I would think that we're working on a five minute schedule .
"Don't forget that when they first did this, people would not have had personal watches."
And there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the  town hall or the church.
Clocks are a very  recent er  introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned.
What might have they have had to measure the time as it passed?
Egg timer.
Sundial.
"Sundial, yes."
But that might not have been too convenient.
Egg timer.
Say it was night for instance.
Pardon?
One of them sand things.
One of them sand things.
Who knows what they're called?
Egg timer.
An egg timer is what we use them for now.
Do you know what the traditional name for them is?
Anybody know?
It's called an hourglass.
Have you heard that before?
No.
Sir.
You scratched your nose and you've got acid on them gloves.
Right.
I did didn't I?
Yeah.
But I  I should come out in great welts soon and start looking like an American werewolf in London.
"Right, my face will start falling off."
Quite right.
You must be careful not to unconsciously  touch anything with  even the gloves.
And you should wash the gloves  as soon as you've touched the acid.
Mm.
"kingpin fairy, she sat on someone's head and she had this massive gown all over her, and that was really visual."
Erm
Yeah.
"he we wanted to her get off he just ran up to this erm, ladder and she just grabbed onto him, he just pulled it away."
Is that ?
Yeah.
"It's really hard, yeah."
You cannot visualize something taking place.
It's really wordy isn't it?
It's really sort of.
"And also, I mean, so many of the, the jokes just are  very"
quick jokes.
Yeah.
"They're based on maybe one word in a sentence but if you miss that, you've missed it."
And that doesn't really matter in the theatre because you carry on
Yeah.
"along by the visual gags, so neither of them when"
Yeah.
"you're reading it, you feel you've got to  you've got to follow the  follow the script."
"And the other thing about visual things, let's, let's say  there is a reference to somebody having piles, but they make it a visual gag"
Yeah.
Yeah.
whereas on the page it is  you know
Yeah.
schoolboy humour.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
"Erm  I mean, nevertheless, obviously it's just somebody on the  scene is a bit"
and that free way of talking  about pain.
And wrote it like that and published it like that.
I should have done that straight away.
Well spotted.
I will do it now.
"Say that again Paul, please."
"I'm sorry Paul, I can't understand you."
Something about an extractor?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It might be harmful to your lungs.
It hasn't been used yet.
But it's not er as good as
Well that's what it says it is on the erm  on the outside.
Orange spot on me notes .
Mm?
see what it was.
Now it's green.
That means it's been used with  copper.
We have a suspicion that  very little reaction has taken place because in fact very few bubbles have  risen to the surface.
This could be  I don't think acid spends itself as it sits in a bottle does it?
No.
It stays the same configuration.
Mm.
It's erm if you've used that lots and lots of times it may have used up all the .
It  may have exhausted mayn't it?
Yeah.
So  because it worked last time I used it.
I'm hoping that it has worked this time.
It's been in there much longer than  I'd normally leave it.
"So, it will either have not worked at all for some obscure reason  or it will have worked well and ."
"So whatever has happened, I'm now going to remove it from the acid."
I'm going to wash it.
Mhm.
"But erm  and if you listen to the tape long enough you can, I can pick up the tune,"
Mhm.
"as well, and just, and have the words."
And then as long as the pianist or the accordionist know the tune I'm alright
Can you take it off the
Mhm.
music as well though if you had to?
If somebody gave you a bit of sheet music?
No.
No I would have to learn the tune like by listening to the
Aha.
to the person singing.
Aha.
"That's the only way I would  learn a tune, I couldn't sight-read the"
Mhm.
the music off a sheet.
Right.
Do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that?
"No, though I would like to have been able to have played, I can remember saying to my mother once, I would like to have been able to have learnt the piano."
And er but of course they couldn't afford to buy me a piano to learn on so
Mhm.
that was it.
Any other instruments
Mhm.
you particularly like?
I that I like?
"Or would have, to listen to?"
"To listen to, to listen to, mhm."
"I like the guitar, I like to listen to the guitar, not the classical stuff, I'm sorry to say but, I like to listen to the guitar."
"Or er a clarinet, I like the sound of"
"Aha, aha"
I promise you a pound if you
and then they walk in the bin so I suggest you don't give me any hassle
"Oh I'll give you , I'll give you a pound don't worry, make sure you do the job properly, mm  you'd better do it outside, cos the er, the boot polish don't go on the carpet."
ah look at this mum  look I'm wiping for a pound
Alright
"if I can see my face in them you, you might have a tip"
See you've got your purse in your bag you better give me the money
"Why wait in the car breaker, breaker"
No
come round
See he does it with my voice.
Now your at home
Yeah
innit?
"No, no, like you, like you say is any one tape the first tape you fill in it"
No but I mean you've got to fill in after all this?
Yeah I
what's that bit stuck on
"what's, what's all that off?"
It's his hairstyle
are you sure you turned that bleeding kettle off?
I have
Well why's it still steaming then?
Cos it's hot
And the frying pan  not really I think the taste is distorted or something
"The taste gone wrong, erm, what you want?"
What shall I put?
"Which part, how do I write"
erm
is the alphabetic
yeah
What?
Oh  and how you
pocket
Yeah.
and clip the thing on there and they'll think it's a bloody  radio or something!
"Yeah you wanna get some headphones for that as well, then that makes all"
I've got some headphones.
Yeah well they're not made to work are they
They're at work
cos they
No I can't afford this.
"No you don't plug them in, just put the wire in your pocket  then they'll think they can just listen to music."
"Well then they won't talk to me  they won't take any notice anyway, if they do, I've got a letter I can tell them what I'm doing."
Go on  expla a letter will make a
Well drink up!
people if they say what the hell are you doing.
You what?
Hey down!
Just drink it
She's stirred him up.
properly!
If people say to you
I'm drinking it properly
"what the hell are you doing, you give them that  and if they say they don't wish to be on the tape  you have to erase their voice."
Oh.
Na
Some people might not object  although it's anonymous
Me.
no one knows whose voice it is but
It's nanny
Me go  me go.
I've got about ten of them to give people if they ask  we what are you doing.
Look a
Yes.
And then we paid for a winter clean.
And it's filthy!
Mm.
I had to go down there twice
To get it done!
Okay?
Because the windows were filthy!
"Twice, that we argued  ."
"Well, well  you came here didn't you when the curtains hadn't been"
Jump down then Phillip!
"And when I spoke to Mr , I said well  if I was renting a caravan and went to see it and it was dirty like that, I wouldn't want to take it on!"
"And, I said surely you have somebody who goes round and checks them before they're let?"
"No, he said!"
"So what they do is, apparently they wait for somebody to complain"
Yeah.
and then they look at the caravan!
Do they?
That's somebody who comes up to rent it!
So I said and in that case then  probably  you move them into another caravan?
"Oh no, we clean it and  they go into it!"
"I said, you mean to say people wait around while you clean the caravan?"
I don't believe it!
"You're alright , you're alright for your holiday, find a caravan dirty, you've gotta complain before it gets cleaned!"
Ha!
People will !
They can complain to the Tourist Board.
to be done when he was he.
Should be bloody licensed!
You can did you say?
You can.
You can't!
No it's alright!
"But this, this bloke has sort of said, ooh he said, apparently one of the blokes  that were working for him said  that he had overheard him saying they were gonna burn the coach out."
Oh!
"And if this chap said, the one that took it that night, he said there is no point in him doing it because he didn't have the coaches insured for enough."
No.
No.
"He took this bloke in, he didn't have a job."
Isn't it mean?
Mm.
You know the er
It is.
"Cou po , could possibly"
Yeah.
going on the what not.
And did this chap do it?
They don't know who did it.
No.
"They tried to make Jim had done his own coach, the one that took us over"
Yeah.
there.
Yeah.
"But he le , they let him go off on holiday in the end."
It wa it was the night before they went on holiday.
How depressing Marg!
"I mean I can understand it in this day and age, people trying to"
Get their money back.
Yeah.
Get their money from insurance policies and try and make their money back
"I suppose what it really amounts to, it's probably someone who's in the same line of business  and they're trying to get the best way aren't they?"
Mm.
But it's a nasty business isn't it?
I know.
You put the word the carrier?
I just put carrier cos
"We , I understand what you're saying because yo , that's what it's used erm"
"I'm looking, I'm from sort of like"
in the conditions.
a legal point of view.
Yeah.
I understand what you mean.
"Danny's point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document, T, the T N T Express U K will hereafter be known as the carrier"
Carrier.
"he's put, so we wrote"
So really that's saying the title
"Yeah, the legal"
actually.
title it does say.
"But I was just gonna say, it's understandable"
Mm.
him thinking in terms and conditions of carriage.
Yeah.
"Yo , you wouldn't have just put the carrier normally would you?"
"That's what I'm saying, so  er, just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there."
Right.
No worries.
What is a definition of a consignment?
"Now if you get these right, word for word  you'll be er, I do conditions of carriage quizzes on selling skills courses  and the amount of people that get this right I can count on one hand in the last three years."
Who got it right?
David.
Word for word?
What was the bit you did?
"Not word for word, now"
"What did he say, please?"
"He said, one or more items to one address."
I that's what I mean
Yeah
it's not like they're gonna be
no
like old times
in the morning
"That's right, I"
probably economise
You'd be no good working for
standing there waiting for
you'd be out
"as a fact  your hair at the back, don't tell anybody you're a hairdresser for god's sake."
Pardon?
Where's Kim?
"Over at Dave's, Dave's at er, we're talking about the er,"
"there, talking about the greengage and er, says oh to Jackie, he said, oh yes Stuart's the M C for tonight, M C, M C, what do I want M C for?"
I said well it gives them a bit of panache don't it?
"Well, oh probably, here we go, got one on"
ain't take
No
by the time you get up the road and get back  why people really
along here I don't know
"I don't know , I don't know"
you don't have
"I won't take this, I'll leave it here"
yeah
well you're using my
"well, in the left drawer on top of the fridge, lying beneath the fridge"
yes I know
"Ta ra love, see you later, take care now"
"She didn't say what, she's, she's had a bit of a set back since then, she's had gall bladder trouble you know"
Oh yes
Yes.
But
But er
.
Excuse the long .
"Page fifty seven please your worship, Robert James , he is in the cells your worship sorry!"
So it will take a moment for him to be bought up.
There are apparently further charges to be put to him your worship  the charge of theft  and we charge him with handling stolen property.
He's only charged with one offence of criminal deception at the moment.
Right..
"Fifty five sir, fifty six."
Are you Robert James ?
Yes sir.
And what is your home address Mr ?
.
Is your date of birth the fourth of September nineteen fifty four?
That's correct.
Are represented by a solicitor today?
Should be.
Was it Mr ?
I have given the  you have all the documents in front of you.
Well  I think Mr  got represented on a previous occasion that's why I'm asking you that!
Well I don't know sir.
My solicitor's in Birmingham!
"My, my records  sir that Mr  was the duty solicitor on that day."
Oh!
I think he's represented you on more than one occasion .
But don't he know that his solicitor's gotta be here for the  today?
I haven't a clue what's happening!
"I didn't know, I mean I could of spoken to ."
"Well you're the defendant, one would of thought yo yo yo know what'll happen to you!"
I haven't .
and what we do we meet up by the golf course
Got a bit of interference there
"Yeah, ah, we meet up by the golf course, cos time I pick"
David up
"David up you there see, I've got to"
the golf course up
So they'll wait for you there then are they?
Well I can get
oh yeah
"and I see, when he sees me park there, flash me, I just follow on, you know"
So I
"what he can do is have something when he gets up, rather than the old"
something sort of
"Yeah well, I don't, I don't get a dinner before I go up to bed."
Well what you got then?
I don't know I think it's Wednesday week
"Well before I go to bed I have baked beans on toast or something like that you know, it's, it's not"
pardon?
Ah?
Oh god
"All of a sudden I'll be home, cor strewth"
you didn't have any of that stuff today then did you?
Yeah I had a glass this morning
Did you?
"Yeah, I've got the shits now I tell yeah"
"eating too much, I suppose if you had a little glass, then just one"
"of that stuff, then some All Bran, you won't be so bad"
No
in fact you had too much you see
No I don't think so
cos you lost none have you?
Yes
Right.
He wrote it and handed it to me for this newsletter and I ran out of space.
Could put the green councillors ten reasons to be one in I suppose.
Yes
Oh yes definitely .
Anything to fit .
It will depend what the space situation is.
A nice grovel can go in.
Advert for the letter box sticker.  want stuff or is it contact through the office to .
Yes.
Unless you have unless you have supplied a specific date.
Erm if you like I can provide a a specific spiel.
Seeing as it is the you know the birthday edition.
It will it is quite nice er make a thing of it.
I think also if we could have some sort of timings when people could turn up.
Yes sure.
Okay I'll knock those up and I'll have to run that by my household.
Mm yeah.
So when do you need those by then?
Erm er middle of next week I suppose roughly .
Okay.
I would say next meeting is at it's the one time we're going to have one.
Erm and do we have anything else to go in this newsletter?
Erm
I could keep one in the green Eurobonds advert.
Yep
Yeah.
certainly.
Fine idea.
And if anybody thinks of any more diary dates or anything.
Yeah I'll let you know.
I think there might be a I've got one  announcement you can put  from that.
. Punch and Judy show.
Magic  and juggling with ka plate spinning.
Er Playbus painting competition.
"Raffle, refreshments, tombola  and various merchandise stalls so I suppose  that's us."
Quite
Mm.
Do they do fire eating act or
We can contortionism or   my legs up behind my neck.
An alternative might be to just to ask whether some of our membership forms could be  put out so that
Well I think they're more interested in the five pounds!
Yeah alright well.
Yeah.
I mean to make a contribution.
No to be honest because that that's what Greenpeace do isn't it?
Don't you belong?
Yeah  start the Harlow one up
Yeah.
the whole of their effort really is devoted to
Yeah they don't do it.
"They're actually, they just do fund raising to their local groups and everything else is obviously sort of controlled by central office or"
That's right everything is central.
Ac action is central  or something.
Yeah but I mean
So they're probably just gonna have their  you know  merchandise and a few people sort of
It's difficult really because I mean we're sort of striving for the same sort of things
I know.
Yeah.
aren't we.
It's er  you don't want to be seen to be erm
Who's it actually run by?
competing with each other in any way.
Well.
Don't see why not.
"Some of it's useful, I mean"
What and that thing?
What?
That can be chucked.
"Well, we need it, the amount of stuff at the moment, and get rid of it  when we  know what we're doing with that thing."
Well we're gonna need two removal vans.
"Well if we have two removal vans, we have two removal vans!"
We didn't fit in the last one.
We only just fitted.
"The company pays for it, I don't care!"
And that was squeezing it.
But if the company pays for it I don't give a damn!
Hadn't you better contact Pickfords.
"Well they'll do it, I'm sure one"
Cos er they might sort of book them up ahead or something.
They'll do it in time.
They're not moving much at the moment.
Aren't they?
Well obviously not.
"Oh yeah, true !"
The housing market is hardly buoyant is it?
"So, in other words, you can  push them down a bit."
Did you get the er  bit they saved on the  stamp duty  to buy the kitchen?
It's possible.
Does that mean yes?
Oh good!
Mum was so embarrassed!
"She didn't know how you got the chee , the nerve to do it!"
Disgraceful!
"If you don't ask, you don't get anything."
"Don't ask, you don't get!"
Well
"And I'll tell you what, what they're getting from us is infinitely better than they're getting from anybody else."
"You see even from Leeds North West  the outside party job and the P T pay monthly, so it's important that the client knows what he's gonna be facing."
But what we do is we estimate three months
Mm.
and divide by three.
Yeah.
"Then you get an average,"
Not bad.
"you know, and that's, that's the way"
What's that mean?
Mm?
No.
I think's it's quite generous
Don't be mean .
actually.
Next one Den.
Well.
There aren't any more.
Ther there have been quite a few that have come out recently which I haven't briefed.
Some of them are fairly minor and it's  to read them.
"Others which are perhaps a little bit of er a change from what we've been used to doing,"
Mm.
are currently being revised yet again.
So I'll pick them up at the next brief.
Right.
I think an hour of this is about enough isn't it?
Den that was great.
I mean I know there's been a lot of debate and I know that er you may feel it's been a bit of a waste of time
but  the fact that there's been so much debate
"If, if, if you say, Mary had a little lamb"
Mary had a
Oh
"I rang them up, it's, it's Bolton, but they don't do"
"wax, they do all the other waxes"
Bury isn't it?
Well I'd try Time and
Bury the one?
"They caught , I don't, yeah actually"
the address I had
Yes.
"Oh well I'll, I'll look, I'll ring I didn't actually ring"
I'll find out anyway
them up and ask them
"and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff."
Do they?
"Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere."
What is the recipe I
"Bury ,, Bury"
Mm
"That's a good one isn't it, dear me, that's er"
"Oh no, but, they, they will post it"
"Post it, but then they're gonna charge aren't they?"
Oh yeah
VAT and for a small amount it's not worth it really
One of the dogs gone down there?
I am sick and tired of picking up the mud
Hello Ken
"Oh, we're trying to see if any pick up the nails in the wall, you know"
"those boards trying to get them split down you see to make some, you know, shelves and that"
"No, not really"
Does it work?
It's got the battery in it
Well I'm not sure really it didn't seem to go to good on the cast iron nails you know the long ones
Six.
So the gradient
Six .
"Wh when you do it to sort of fairly accurately like that, it  six."
"When we did it fairly roughly, it came to one point two?"
Yeah.
"Erm  six Because, because we didn't do this bit did we?"
That should have gone I think that was wrong.
That should have been six times nought point two over
Minu
Yeah.
Which again comes to six.
"So, that's more like it."
"What's the, what angle has a tan of six, then?"
Now it'll be in the seventy or eighties.
Eighty.
Eighty?
Good.
to be fifty.
Erm you can do that with any curve.
"If I gave you sort of X to the seventeen or something, well you could put two values in."
"And you could bring them fairly close together and say well I can't tell you exactly what the gradient is at that point, but if you draw a tiny little line and take the gradient of that."
Mm.
"That's er that's good enough, that's close enough."
That's a very good approximation.
Yeah.
"So gradients are a very important part of, of sketching a curve."
Erm you already pointed out some of the important points where the gradient gets to zero.
"Erm  does, does  things that might be interesting?"
Okay.
"You've already mentioned it earlier, actually, symmetry."
Not always symmetrical about this axis.
"Now it looks like, ah just stopped moving again, straight line, fixed speed that, this looks as if it's accelerating."
"It's very, it's deceptive if you're not working out what you're doing and relating it back to the graph, and relating it back to physics, to an experiment you're doing, someone's checking the clock every second to see how much further it's gone."
"Oh well, in the last second it went another ten metres."
Last second it went another ten metres.
It's going at a steady speed.
Fixed constant velocity.
"But here, that's still where it was last time I checked my watch."
Yeah.
Not moving.
So that's a steady speed.
And it stops.
"That's, it changes  abruptly."
From a steady speed.
It doesn't need to brake or does it just?
Mm.
"If it's a physical body, to change speed, it'll have to have to brake."
"And the s what would, so, that's a fixed speed."
There's another str another straight line  .
"There's another straight line, another fixed speed."
Which one is faster?
"Every one second,ten metres."
Every second that's going more than ten metres
Right.
So that
So the steeper it is?
The faster.
The faster it's going.
"So at this point, it's almost flat."
So it's going very slowly.
Now what's happening to its speed?
Accelerating.
Yeah.
More than half the people don't want any help at all.
"Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily."
"erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating."
"they're both, press it hard  right that's going."
"Press the one, the black one behind there to switch it off."
So we're on now are we?
Come on beauty
Have you made any tea?
No.
"Oh dear, oh dear oh dear."
Oh you   hello little doggy.
"Try cooking this ham, do you think they might like it then?"
Sorry?
The ham.
The dogs.
Try cooking it.
Oh.
Well wouldn't be able  tempt them into er
I mean really they should    they don't mind
Well that's the availability of the things isn't it?
I think you might have to er  take him down the road  afterwards  when it clears up.
Oh you're not going to take them with you?
Well  See how it goes
It's going off a bit now isn't it?
Oh no.
Erm  you do realize this ham is already cooked don't you?
No.
No.
"Thought it might, they won't eat it like that, that's"
Have they not eaten anything at all?
I haven't given them anything yet.
The acceleration there is say forwards.
One two
"And for every one second, you're going forty metres per second."
So you're going at a steady speed.
Per second.
"It's, it's a, it's an acceleration, it's metres second to the minus two."
"Now are you happy with that, because most people aren't?"
Okay.
"We'll come back to that in a minute, but  let's say  a rocket, or a car, which would you prefer that do?"
Car.
Car.
Constant acceleration car.
"Erm  no frictional resis resistance, you just put your foot down and it's, you know where a car accelerates from rest"
Mm.
and then after a while the acceleration reduces?
"The speed is still going up, the acceleration, and eventually it reaches a top speed and it stays there."
Mm.
"Okay, it's zero acceleration, it's not getting any faster."
Mm.
Erm  how would we measure that?
A constant acceleration.
Say we had an accelerometer.
An acceleration measurer.
Mm.
"Which  force on a weight or something  can feel acceleration, I think you can, my son said you can't but I think you can"
"So, acceleration is a constant."
What's your eventual top speed?
"It just, just keeps going faster and faster and faster and faster"
Infinity.
"Infinity, speed of light, when you hit something."
It's pretty high.
Mm.
"Yeah, so said it was that  spaghetti Bolognese that did it."
Makes you thirsty.
Mm.
"Well, it's probably"
Mm.
it's probably that.
Maybe it is a flu going around then.
Well these all need to be  well I mean quite often this stuff we can
Throw?
"no, no, half of this stuff we can actually  keep bi , or or leave, leave for them because it's actually  relevant information."
What leave them bills and everything?
No I mean it's
And guarantees?
"Well it's no damn good to us once we've moved, is it?"
"Ooh God, they've had the house at a cheap rate anyway!"
They can damn well pay for these stuff if it breaks down!
That's not the point!
Just stop it!
Are we taking the cooker with us or not?
"Not the cooker, no."
"So they get i ,we will work pay for all our appliances and stuff?"
Eh?
Will work pay for all our appliances?
"Not all of them, no."
"Well a lot of , yeah?"
And water softener as well?
All those big salt pebble things I have to fill up every week in the ?
Well I guess we may get a  we may get ourselves a  waste disposable unit.
Good!
"Get one of those we got  in, particularly in favour of those."
Does she like them?
Stick some raw eggs and things down there.
You're not supposed to know .
"Oh my, I'm not supposed to see."
Switch it off now for a few minutes.
Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.
The  worm.
Look at these flowers!
So these are lovely!
Mm mm.
Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.
Hmm mm.
Why is it pure gin?
I think Ted would be proud of me.
"Well, my stars say   if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry."
Every so often we all need to wind down.
There you are.
"If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign."
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities .
Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?
I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.
Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
"The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm."
"If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love."
"In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think."
"Indeed, the more selfless you can be this weekend, the better things will work out"
Oh how nice.
That sounds good to me .
What's Virgo?
Better .
"Cos some people  er er  may think, you know, the agreement because I have split the load you can still charge me the same price and it may not be the case."
Right.
Next one.
What's the question  ja Andy?
"What is the cus , sorry, what should"
What should
the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
What was some of the answers there?
"Janey's put, name, address, from another consignment note filled out and service requirement"
and weight of the consignment.
Yeah.
So what we were looking for was something more  er erm
Did I answer that one?
No.
I didn't get round to it.
"Anybody get what we were looking for in the, yes you should?"
What should the customer provide prior to the collection of a consignment?
"Well obviously the delivery name and address is important and the consignments, so you didn't get that wrong but there was, what we were looking for  as well a full written declaration of the nature of contents of any consignment containing dangerous  infested, contaminated"
Aha.
or fragile goods.
"In other words, is there anything, did anybody pick up"
You got that.
"Yeah,"
unusual
I did.
"I might have given you one there, that looks good enough."
Oh.
Did you get that there?
I did a part of it.
Oh
I reckon Justin's got enough cos
What
We've gotta devise a new land reform law.
What's our priority?
"What, what, what really is the land reform  to achieve now?"
of feudalism
You've gotta
Right.
Yeah.
Protect commerce and industry.
protect commerce and industry.
"Yeah, I guess it's all"
Just looked after  go on.
Erm  well  erm it's that
Yeah.
we are now in power  but I don't think  that presumably proved that we can run an economy efficiently
Mm.
and
once we've got that then we have the resources from that I think to introduce other programmes that take
Mm.
"quite a long time to implement, for example"
Mhm.
erm
"Wh when you're saying to run the economy, do you mean the rural economy or the economy, you know, China as a whole?"
Well let's say we've moved on to and we're into nineteen forty nine say
Yeah.
and we've  in nineteen forty nine
"and  w w w we are either half controlled or we're, we can now see that you know the civil war is, is going so quickly our way that we are going to have control  within a year or so we are likely to have control over the economy as a whole."
D does that begin to make a difference?
Yes because now
Right.
Yes.
So we then have to coordinate our policies
Mm.
Okay.
Yes.
"Apparently we've got a mistake on the back of that form, that it referred to a noncompliance report, on the back, which is referring to the front but the front was called a quick-fix report"
you see?
"So I said, should I fill in a quick-fix report or a noncompliance report, to say that the quick-fix form, or is it a noncompliance report is wrong."
Right.
We'll get there.
Erm
He said I could leave it with him and he'd sort it out.
there have er
first mistake .
"there have been some fairly er minor alterations to the procedures concerning contract admin wallets er and the various client reports, er but Hugh did ask me to raise them at this meeting, er to remind people of the need to er complete client reports."
Correct.
And I've rai I raised it this morning.
Right.
And erm in the context of Regional Railways
Fine.
wanting them from us.
Yeah.
But I must say that we're using these client reports and  managers within each section
I know you are.
the only one who is.
are finding them extremely useful
Mm.
"in keeping an idea of where the jobs are,"
Yeah.
and the comments I'm getting back from the er the clients are very very favourable.
Right.
They do find them extremely helpful.
Have you run off
C
any interim report from t the computer yet?
Yeah.
"Right well we'd normally say, miles per hour per second."
"What's, what's your acceleration at the moment?"
Well it's ten miles per hour per second.
Okay?
"Well every second, I'm going"
I'm going ten miles an hour faster.
"So miles per hour per second, or you could measure it per hour if you wanted."
"Every hour, I'm going six hundred miles an hour faster"
So
so it's miles per hour per hour.
you'd need a stopwatch and a speedometer.
"You'd need a something to, I say, we've got something to measure the speed, radar gun,"
Mm.
"not interested in the distance, just the velocity, the speed."
How fast is that car going now?
"Okay, he's doing forty miles an hour."
Measure him again in one second's time
He's doing sixty.
"he's doing sixty miles an hour, so his acceleration was twenty miles per hour per second."
Per second.
"Twenty miles per hour per second,miles per hour, what's the change this miles per hour into metres per second."
"Okay, so,say a hundred and twenty metres per second per second."
And that's where your per second per second comes in.
Are you a bit happier with that?
Yeah.
But not totally convinced.
No .
"Erm  that length per time per time, is the unit."
Let's just have a little look.
What are the units of displacement?
Er
"You know, where's our right to life come from?"
I think you can far too sentimental about it!
"Erm  humans are more important than animals, you you cannot gi equate an animal life with human life."
We are the intelligent order.
"Being intelligent, we hope we won't be cruel to animals, but you can't say that we are, animals are just as important as humans."
Mhm.
"Wha , why do you think we are more intelligent than animals?"
"Well, for a start"
"You know , because we can have television"
we could
studios?
No!
"We can reason with each other, animals don't reason with"
But
other.
"We have conversations, animals don't have conversations!"
"We are, we are living in a world , we are living in a world where constantly there's violence, does that happen in the animal world!"
Yes of course it does!
Of course it does!
Of course it does!
To the same extent?
They're horrible!
Animals are terribly cruel to each other!
N no well
Yes?
I can't accept that!
"Surely if intelligence is the answer, you know, what about mentally handicapped children?"
"They're, they're not intelligent, does that mean they're just the same as animals?"
"If intelligence is the criteria, then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals!"
Mhm.
We have a choice if we want to be involved in research
Mhm.
going on.
"that falls down Hugh, is that people assume because they've commented that, that when it comes out in its final version it'll reflect their particular comment."
"They never get a feedback saying, thanks for those comments but I've  those because, because I thought somebody else's"
comments were more
a lot more slice .
No.
No.
"Not not, not"
It's just a modification from
Yeah.
the slices
"L lots of the revisions are not sliced and certainly in, in cases like this where"
Mm.
it is a er er a specific
Direct.
"request or a direct request that something is changed, then it"
is given to in this particular case the Dave  s of the world or other function heads and told
I would still like to issue
that.
"Er a and I think we issue it and then t in Jim's situation, erm I think what you tell your staff is that this, this has been issued, and we are gonna find a way of erm working it in your organization."
Or if it is impossible to do so then we will have to have a look.
"Well surely it, it just means that in in Jim's organization"
"I, I don't see the problem."
that when specifically requested w will apply in
in ninety nine percent of the cases.
That will be reflected in the quality plan anyway.
So
Yeah.
where's
Yes.
the problem?
Mm.
Well if there i if there in a
"no matter who, no matter what !"
If they're in a corrupt society  and when they get to that position they  they don't do anything about it and accept
Well they
it and take
they don't
"the bribes, well yes I agree this is the"
Yeah.
the
Yeah.
basis of the mafia isn't it?
"Ah, you see if  if you don't, I mean  it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life  but in big business and in politics  if you don't"
You have to modify your
"I'll tell you , I'll tell you how"
"No, no if you don't tow the line"
Exactly!
If you just don't
if you'd be elected
Yes  and you don't modify you  what happens?
You don't get anywhere!
You don't get elected which is what happened
Well
to the Labour government
No
last time!
"oh well, oh well apart apart from being"
No.
elected
fifty percent of the population
apart from that
"wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the  Labour government didn't get in  on that basis  so they had to modify their  and I mean as"
Well you can use that for any argument then
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"`` There is no sense in believing a thing just because you 'd like to believe it , Susan Baker ."
The British have lost millions of men at the Somme and how far have they got ?
"Look facts in the face , Susan Baker , look facts in the face . ''"
`` They are wearing the Germans out and so long as that happens it does not matter whether it is done a few miles east or a few miles west .
"I am not , '' admitted Susan in tremendous humility , `` I am not a military expert , Sophia Crawford , but even I can see that , and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything ."
The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world .
"Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum 's son Roderick , from the Upper Glen ?"
He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week .
"He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on , till you would have supposed everything was lovely ."
"But when he signed his name , right in between Roderick and MacCallum , he wrote two Gaelic words that meant ` all lies ' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy 's name ."
"So he let it pass , never dreaming how he was diddled ."
"Well , I am going to leave the war to Haig for the rest of the day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake ."
And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf .
The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it .
We had company for tea that night and when I went to get my cake what a sight did I behold ! ''
`` Has that pore orphan 's father never been heerd from yet ? ''
asked Cousin Sophia .
"`` Yes , I had a letter from him in July , '' said Rilla ."
"`` He said that when he got word of his wife 's death and of my taking the baby -- Mr. Meredith wrote him , you know -- he wrote right away , but as he never got any answer he had begun to think his letter must have been lost . ''"
"`` It took him two years to begin to think it , '' said Susan scornfully ."
`` Some people think very slow .
"Jim Anderson has not got a scratch , for all he has been two years in the trenches ."
"A fool for luck , as the old proverb says . ''"
"`` He wrote very nicely about Jims and said he 'd like to see him , '' said Rilla ."
"`` So I wrote and told him all about the wee man , and sent him snapshots ."
Jims will be two years old next week and he is a perfect duck . ''
"`` You did n't used to be very fond of babies , '' said Cousin Sophia ."
"`` I 'm not a bit fonder of babies in the abstract than ever I was , '' said Rilla , frankly ."
"`` But I do love Jims , and I 'm afraid I was n't really half as glad as I should have been when Jim Anderson 's letter proved that he was safe and sound . ''"
`` You was n't hoping the man would be killed ! ''
cried Cousin Sophia in horrified accents .
`` No -- no -- no !
"`` She 's bound to be across now , '' I whispered ."
"`` Na , '' said Alan , `` her foot still sounds boss * upon the bridge . ''"
* Hollow .
And just then -- `` Who goes ? ''
"cried a voice , and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones ."
"I must suppose the sentry had been sleeping , so that had we tried , we might have passed unseen ; but he was awake now , and the chance forfeited ."
"`` This 'll never do , '' said Alan ."
"`` This 'll never , never do for us , David . ''"
"And without another word , he began to crawl away through the fields ; and a little after , being well out of eye-shot , got to his feet again , and struck along a road that led to the eastward ."
"I could not conceive what he was doing ; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment , that I was little likely to be pleased with anything ."
"A moment back and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor 's door to claim my inheritance , like a hero in a ballad ; and here was I back again , a wandering , hunted blackguard , on the wrong side of Forth ."
`` Well ? ''
"said I. `` Well , '' said Alan , `` what would ye have ?"
They 're none such fools as I took them for .
"We have still the Forth to pass , Davie -- weary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it ! ''"
`` And why go east ? ''
"said I. `` Ou , just upon the chance ! ''"
said he .
"`` If we cannae pass the river , we 'll have to see what we can do for the firth . ''"
"`` There are fords upon the river , and none upon the firth , '' said I. `` To be sure there are fords , and a bridge forbye , '' quoth Alan ; `` and of what service , when they are watched ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` but a river can be swum . ''"
"`` By them that have the skill of it , '' returned he ; `` but I have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise ; and for my own part , I swim like a stone . ''"
"`` I 'm not up to you in talking back , Alan , '' I said ; `` but I can see we 're making bad worse ."
"If it 's hard to pass a river , it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea . ''"
"`` But there 's such a thing as a boat , '' says Alan , `` or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` Ay , and such a thing as money , '' says I. `` But for us that have neither one nor other , they might just as well not have been invented . ''"
`` Ye think so ? ''
said Alan .
"`` I do that , '' said I. `` David , '' says he , `` ye 're a man of small invention and less faith ."
"But let me set my wits upon the hone , and if I cannae beg , borrow , nor yet steal a boat , I 'll make one ! ''"
`` I think I see ye ! ''
"said I. `` And what 's more than all that : if ye pass a bridge , it can tell no tales ; but if we pass the firth , there 's the boat on the wrong side -- somebody must have brought it -- the country-side will all be in a bizz -- '' `` Man ! ''"
"`` How lovely , '' cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip ."
"`` I thought all the fairies were dead , '' Mrs. Darling said ."
"`` There are always a lot of young ones , '' explained Wendy , who was now quite an authority , `` because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born , and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies ."
"They live in nests on the tops of trees ; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls , and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are . ''"
"`` I shall have such fun , '' said Peter , with eye on Wendy ."
"`` It will be rather lonely in the evening , '' she said , `` sitting by the fire . ''"
`` I shall have Tink . ''
"`` Tink ca n't go a twentieth part of the way round , '' she reminded him a little tartly ."
`` Sneaky tell-tale ! ''
Tink called out from somewhere round the corner .
"`` It does n't matter , '' Peter said ."
"`` O Peter , you know it matters . ''"
"`` Well , then , come with me to the little house . ''"
"`` May I , mummy ? ''"
`` Certainly not .
"I have got you home again , and I mean to keep you . ''"
`` But he does so need a mother . ''
"`` So do you , my love . ''"
"`` Oh , all right , '' Peter said , as if he had asked her from politeness merely ; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch , and she made this handsome offer : to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning ."
Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement ; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming ; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again .
"He had no sense of time , and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them ."
"I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones : `` You wo n't forget me , Peter , will you , before spring cleaning time comes ? ''"
Of course Peter promised ; and then he flew away .
He took Mrs. Darling 's kiss with him .
"The kiss that had been for no one else , Peter took quite easily ."
Funny .
But she seemed satisfied .
"Of course all the boys went to school ; and most of them got into Class III , but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class ."
"Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island ; but it was too late now , and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor -LSB- the younger Jenkins -RSB- ."
It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them .
"At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night ; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses -LSB- the English double-deckers -RSB- ; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed , and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus ."
In time they could not even fly after their hats .
"My voice stuck in my throat , for I ever hated to take part in lies ; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot , for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue ."
`` Has he nae friends ? ''
"said she , in a tearful voice ."
`` That has he so ! ''
"cried Alan , `` if we could but win to them !"
"-- friends and rich friends , beds to lie in , food to eat , doctors to see to him -- and here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman . ''"
`` And why that ? ''
says the lass .
"`` My dear , '' said Alan , `` I cannae very safely say ; but I 'll tell ye what I 'll do instead , '' says he , `` I 'll whistle ye a bit tune . ''"
"And with that he leaned pretty far over the table , and in a mere breath of a whistle , but with a wonderful pretty sentiment , gave her a few bars of `` Charlie is my darling . ''"
"`` Wheesht , '' says she , and looked over her shoulder to the door ."
"`` That 's it , '' said Alan ."
`` And him so young ! ''
cries the lass .
"`` He 's old enough to -- '' and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck , meaning that I was old enough to lose my head ."
"`` It would be a black shame , '' she cried , flushing high ."
"`` It 's what will be , though , '' said Alan , `` unless we manage the better . ''"
"At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house , leaving us alone together ."
"Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes , and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child ."
"`` Alan , '' I cried , `` I can stand no more of this . ''"
"`` Ye 'll have to sit it then , Davie , '' said he ."
"`` For if ye upset the pot now , ye may scrape your own life out of the fire , but Alan Breck is a dead man . ''"
"This was so true that I could only groan ; and even my groan served Alan 's purpose , for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale ."
`` Poor lamb ! ''
"says she , and had no sooner set the meat before us , than she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch , as much as to bid me cheer up ."
"Then she told us to fall to , and there would be no more to pay ; for the inn was her own , or at least her father 's , and he was gone for the day to Pittencrieff ."
"We waited for no second bidding , for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt excellently well ; and while we sat and ate , she took up that same place by the next table , looking on , and thinking , and frowning to herself , and drawing the string of her apron through her hand ."
"`` I 'm thinking ye have rather a long tongue , '' she said at last to Alan ."
`` Ay '' said Alan ; `` but ye see I ken the folk I speak to . ''
"`` I would never betray ye , '' said she , `` if ye mean that . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` ye 're not that kind ."
"But I 'll tell ye what ye would do , ye would help . ''"
"`` Wake me up when she comes , '' said rob , and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in Nan 's lap under the pinafore ."
"The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes , staring about her with anxious eyes , and feeling as if each second was an hour ."
"Then a pale light began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself , `` I guess the night is over and morning is coming ."
"I 'd like to see the sun rise , so I 'll watch , and when it comes up we can find our way right home . ''"
"But before the moon 's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope , Nan had fallen asleep , leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns , and was deep in a mid-summer night 's dream of fire-flies and blue aprons , mountains of huckleberries , and Robby wiping away the tears of a black cow , who sobbed , `` I want to go home !"
I want to go home ! ''
"While the children were sleeping , peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes , the family at home were in a great state of agitation ."
"The hay-cart came at five , and all but Jack , Emil , Nan , and Rob were at the bars ready for it ."
"Franz drove instead of Silas , and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood , he said , looking ill-pleased , `` They ought to have left Rob to ride , he will be tired out by the long walk . ''"
"`` It 's shorter that way , and they will carry him , '' said Stuffy , who was in a hurry for his supper ."
`` You are sure Nan and Rob went with them ? ''
"`` Of course they did ; I saw them getting over the wall , and sung out that it was most five , and Jack called back that they were going the other way , '' explained Tommy ."
"`` Very well , pile in then , '' and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired children and the full pails ."
"Mrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party , and sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home ."
"Supper was over , and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual , when Franz came trotting back , hot , dusty , and anxious ."
`` Have they come ? ''
he called out when half-way up the avenue .
`` No ! ''
and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round Franz .
"`` I ca n't find them anywhere , '' he began ; but the words were hardly spoken when a loud `` Hullo ! ''"
"startled them all , and the next minute Jack and Emil came round the house ."
`` Where are Nan and Rob ? ''
"cried Mrs. Jo , clutching Emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits ."
`` I do n't know .
"They came home with the others , did n't they ? ''"
"he answered , quickly ."
`` No ; George and Tommy said they went with you . ''
"`` Well , they did n't ."
Have n't seen them .
"We took a swim in the pond , and came by the wood , '' said Jack , looking alarmed , as well he might ."
"`` Call Mr. Bhaer , get the lanterns , and tell Silas I want him . ''"
"That was all Mrs. Jo said , but they knew what she meant , and flew to obey her orders ."
By the most curious coincidence he had opened his heart to me too .
"Being a man , he was n't so discursive as Anne ; he said his say in four pages , but I could read the heartache between the lines ."
He wrote that he was going to Klondike and would start in a month 's time .
He was sick of living now that he 'd lost Anne .
"He said he loved her better than his life and always would , and could never forget her , but he knew she did n't care anything about him now after the way she 'd acted , and he wanted to get as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could ."
"So he was going to Klondike -- going to Klondike , Nora May , when his mother was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her heart for him at St. Mary 's ."
"Well , I folded up them letters and , says I , `` Grandpa Holland , I guess my birthday celebration is here ready to hand . ''"
I thought real hard .
I could n't write myself to explain to those two people that they each thought the world of each other still -- my hands are too stiff ; and I could n't get anyone else to write because I could n't let out what they 'd told me in confidence .
"So I did a mean , dishonourable thing , Nora May ."
I sent Anne 's letter to Gilbert and Gilbert 's to Anne .
"I asked Emma Matilda to address them , and Emma Matilda did it and asked no questions ."
I brought her up that way .
Then I settled down to wait .
In less than a month Gilbert 's mother had a letter from him saying that he was coming home to settle down and marry Anne .
He arrived home yesterday and last night Anne came to Springdale on her way home from St. Mary 's .
They came to see me this morning and said things to me I ai n't going to repeat because they would sound fearful vain .
They were so happy that they made me feel as if it was a good thing to have lived eighty years in a world where folks could be so happy .
They said their new joy was my birthday gift to them .
The wedding is to be in September and I 'm going to Montrose in August to help Anne with her quilts .
"I do n't think anything will happen to prevent this time -- no quarrelling , anyhow ."
Those two young creatures have learned their lesson .
"You 'd better take it to heart too , Nora May ."
It 's less trouble to learn it at second hand .
"Do n't you ever quarrel with your real beau -- it do n't matter about the sham ones , of course ."
"Do n't take offence at trifles or listen to what other people tell you about him -- outsiders , that is , that want to make mischief ."
What you think about him is of more importance than what they do .
"To be sure , you 're too young yet to be thinking of such things at all ."
But just mind what old Aunt Susanna told you when your time comes .
Bertie 's New Year He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world .
"His hands were clasped behind him , and his thin face wore a thoughtful , puzzled look ."
"The door behind him opened jerkingly , and a scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand ."
"Daisy heard it , ran in , saw the empty dish , also the end of a yellow tail disappearing under the bed ."
"Without a word she seized that tail , pulled out the thief , and shook him till his ears flapped wildly , then bundled him down-stairs to the shed , where he spent a lonely evening in the coal-bin ."
"Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her , Daisy made another bowlful of batter , and fried a dozen cakes , which were even better than the others ."
"Indeed , Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had never tasted any so nice , and every boy at the table below envied Demi at the flapjack party above ."
"It was a truly delightful supper , for the little teapot lid only fell off three times and the milk jug upset but once ; the cakes floated in syrup , and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor , owing to cook 's using the gridiron to make it on ."
"Demi forgot philosophy , and stuffed like any carnal boy , while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets , and the dolls looked on smiling affably ."
"`` Well , dearies , have you had a good time ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , coming up with Teddy on her shoulder ."
`` A very good time .
"I shall come again soon , '' answered Demi , with emphasis ."
"`` I 'm afraid you have eaten too much , by the look of that table . ''"
"`` No , I have n't ; I only ate fifteen cakes , and they were very little ones , '' protested Demi , who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate ."
"`` They wo n't hurt him , they are so nice , '' said Daisy , with such a funny mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could only smile and say : `` Well , on the whole , the new game is a success then ? ''"
"`` I like it , '' said Demi , as if his approval was all that was necessary ."
`` It is the dearest play ever made ! ''
"cried Daisy , hugging her little dish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups ."
"`` I just wish everybody had a sweet cooking stove like mine , '' she added , regarding it with affection ."
"`` This play out to have a name , '' said Demi , gravely removing the syrup from his countenance with his tongue ."
`` It has . ''
"`` Oh , what ? ''"
asked both children eagerly .
"`` Well , I think we will call it Pattypans , '' and Aunt Jo retired , satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam ."
CHAPTER VI .
"A FIRE BRAND `` Please , ma'am , could I speak to you ?"
"It is something very important , '' said Nat , popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer 's room ."
"It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour ; but Mrs. Jo was used to it , so she looked up , and said , briskly , `` What is it , my lad ? ''"
"Nat came in , shut the door carefully behind him , and said in an eager , anxious tone , `` Dan has come . ''"
`` Who is Dan ? ''
`` He 's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets .
"He sold papers , and he was kind to me , and I saw him the other day in town , and told him how nice it was here , and he 's come . ''"
"`` But , my dear boy , that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit . ''"
"`` Oh , it is n't a visit ; he wants to stay if you will let him ! ''"
"As for washing dishes , Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came ."
"Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead , and left them to drain dry ."
"Again , Mr. Harrison was `` close . ''"
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan 's salary he said he 'd wait and see how many dollars ' worth of good he got out of his preaching first ... he did n't believe in buying a pig in a poke .
"And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions ... and incidentally to see the inside of the house ... he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of , and he 'd cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she 'd undertake it ."
"Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert Bell was safe in her grave , for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride ."
"`` Why , she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day , '' Mrs. Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly , `` and if you could see it now !"
I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it . ''
"Finally , Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger ."
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before ; consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable .
And such a parrot !
"If you took John Henry Carter 's word for it , never was such an unholy bird ."
It swore terribly .
Mrs. Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him .
"Besides , Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henry 's neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage ."
Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays .
"All these things flashed through Anne 's mind as Mr. Harrison stood , quite speechless with wrath apparently , before her ."
"In his most amiable mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man ; he was short and fat and bald ; and now , with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head , Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen ."
All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice .
"`` I 'm not going to put up with this , '' he spluttered , `` not a day longer , do you hear , miss ."
"Bless my soul , this is the third time , miss ... the third time !"
"Patience has ceased to be a virtue , miss ."
"I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again ... and she 's let it ... she 's done it ... what does she mean by it , that is what I want to know ."
"That is what I 'm here about , miss . ''"
`` Will you explain what the trouble is ? ''
"asked Anne , in her most dignified manner ."
She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began ; but it had no apparent effect on the irate J. A. Harrison .
"`` Trouble , is it ?"
"Bless my soul , trouble enough , I should think ."
"The trouble is , miss , that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt 's in my oats again , not half an hour ago ."
"The third time , mark you ."
I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday .
"He could sleep in the air without falling , by merely lying on his back and floating , but this was , partly at least , because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster ."
"` Do be more polite to him , ' Wendy whispered to John , when they were playing ` Follow my Leader . '"
"` Then tell him to stop showing off , ' said John ."
"When playing Follow my Leader , Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark 's tail in passing , just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing ."
"They could not follow him in this with much success , so perhaps it was rather like showing off , especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed ."
"` You must be nice to him , ' Wendy impressed on her brothers ."
` What could we do if he were to leave us ? '
"` We could go back , ' Michael said ."
` How could we ever find our way back without him ? '
"` Well , then , we could go on , ' said John ."
"` That is the awful thing , John ."
"We should have to go on , for we do n't know how to stop . '"
This was true ; Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop .
"John said that if the worst came to the worst , all they had to do was to go straight on , for the world was round , and so in time they must come back to their own window ."
"` And who is to get food for us , John ? ' '"
"I nipped a bit out of that eagle 's mouth pretty neatly , Wendy . '"
"` After the twentieth try , ' Wendy reminded him ."
"` And even though we became good at picking up food , see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand . '"
Indeed they were constantly bumping .
"They could now fly strongly , though they still kicked far too much ; but if they saw a cloud in front of them , the more they tried to avoid it , the more certainly did they bump into it ."
"If Nana had been with them , she would have had a bandage round Michael 's forehead by this time ."
"Peter was not with them for the moment , and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves ."
"He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight , to have some adventure in which they had no share ."
"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star , but he had already forgotten what it was , or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him , and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening ."
It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid .
"` And if he forgets them , so quickly , ' Wendy argued , ` how can we expect that he will go on remembering us ? '"
"Indeed , sometimes when he returned he did not remember them , at least not well ."
Wendy was sure of it .
She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on ; once even she had to tell him her name .
"` I 'm Wendy , ' she said agitatedly ."
He was very sorry . '
"I say , Wendy , ' he whispered to her , ` always if you see me forgetting you , just keep on saying `` I 'm Wendy , '' and then I 'll remember . '"
Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee .
"He 's never been home since , though his mother has been up to see him once or twice ."
His wife died two years ago and he 's sending the boy home to his mother for a spell .
He 's ten years old and I do n't know if he 'll be a very desirable pupil .
You can never tell about those Yankees . ''
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air .
"They MIGHT be good people , of course ; but you were on the safe side in doubting it ."
She had a special prejudice against `` Yankees . ''
Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it .
"`` Avonlea school wo n't be the worse for a little new blood , '' said Marilla drily , `` and if this boy is anything like his father he 'll be all right ."
"Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts , though some people did call him proud ."
I should think Mrs. Irving would be very glad to have the child .
She has been very lonesome since her husband died . ''
"`` Oh , the boy may be well enough , but he 'll be different from Avonlea children , '' said Mrs. Rachel , as if that clinched the matter ."
"Mrs. Rachel 's opinions concerning any person , place , or thing , were always warranted to wear ."
"`` What 's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society , Anne ? ''"
"`` I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club , '' said Anne , flushing ."
`` They thought it would be rather nice ... and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan .
Lots of villages have them now . ''
"`` Well , you 'll get into no end of hot water if you do ."
"Better leave it alone , Anne , that 's what ."
People do n't like being improved . ''
"`` Oh , we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE ."
It is Avonlea itself .
There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier .
"For instance , if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm would n't that be an improvement ? ''"
"`` It certainly would , '' admitted Mrs. Rachel ."
`` That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years .
"But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he is n't to be paid for doing , may I be there to see and hear the process , that 's what ."
"I do n't want to discourage you , Anne , for there may be something in your idea , though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine ; but you 'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements , that 's what ."
"But there , I know you 'll go ahead with it if you 've set your mind on it ."
You were always one to carry a thing through somehow . ''
"There 's nothing to do , child , except go and see Mr. Harrison about it ."
We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he does n't want to take the money .
She is just as good as his . ''
"`` I 'm sure he 'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it , though , '' moaned Anne ."
`` I daresay he will .
He seems to be an irritable sort of a man .
I 'll go and explain to him if you like . ''
"`` No , indeed , I 'm not as mean as that , '' exclaimed Anne ."
`` This is all my fault and I 'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment .
I 'll go myself and I 'll go at once .
"The sooner it 's over the better , for it will be terribly humiliating . ''"
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door .
On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning ... a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts .
"Anne had intended it for Friday evening , when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society ."
But what were they compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison ?
"Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man , especially one who had to do his own cooking , and she promptly popped it into a box ."
She would take it to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering .
"`` That is , if he gives me a chance to say anything at all , '' she thought ruefully , as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields , golden in the light of the dreamy August evening ."
`` I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution . ''
"III Mr. Harrison at Home Mr. Harrison 's house was an old-fashioned , low-eaved , whitewashed structure , set against a thick spruce grove ."
"Mr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda , in his shirt sleeves , enjoying his evening pipe ."
"When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet , bolted into the house , and shut the door ."
"This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise , mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before ."
But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne 's heart .
"`` If he 's so cross now what will he be when he hears what I 've done , '' she reflected miserably , as she rapped at the door ."
"But Mr. Harrison opened it , smiling sheepishly , and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly , if somewhat nervous ."
"He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat ; he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely , and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes ."
"No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed , `` Bless my soul , what 's that redheaded snippet coming here for ? ''"
"It would be hard to say whose face was the redder , Mr. Harrison 's or Anne 's ."
"`` Do n't you mind that parrot , '' said Mr. Harrison , casting a furious glance at Ginger ."
`` He 's ... he 's always talking nonsense .
I got him from my brother who was a sailor .
`` And I wish I did n't have to go to sleep .
"It is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while , and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning ."
"Do people ever get used to things like this , Susan ?"
"And oh , Susan , I ca n't get away from what Mrs. Reese said ."
Did Walter suffer much -- he was always so sensitive to pain .
"Oh , Susan , if I knew that he did n't I think I could gather up a little courage and strength . ''"
This merciful knowledge was given to Rilla .
"A letter came from Walter 's commanding officer , telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at Courcelette ."
The same day there was a letter for Rilla from Walter himself .
"Rilla carried it unopened to Rainbow Valley and read it there , in the spot where she had had her last talk with him ."
"It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead -- a bitter-sweet thing , in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled ."
"For the first time since the blow had fallen Rilla felt -- a different thing from tremulous hope and faith -- that Walter , of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals , still lived , with just the same gift and just the same ideals ."
That could not be destroyed -- these could suffer no eclipse .
"The personality that had expressed itself in that last letter , written on the eve of Courcelette , could not be snuffed out by a German bullet ."
"It must carry on , though the earthly link with things of earth were broken ."
"`` We 're going over the top tomorrow , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' wrote Walter ."
"`` I wrote mother and Di yesterday , but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight ."
I had n't intended to do any writing tonight -- but I 've got to .
"Do you remember old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour , who was always saying that it was ` laid on her ' to do such and such a thing ?"
"Well , that is just how I feel ."
"It 's ` laid on me ' to write you tonight -- you , sister and chum of mine ."
"There are some things I want to say before -- well , before tomorrow ."
`` You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight .
It 's the first time I 've felt this since I came .
Always home has seemed so far away -- so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood .
But tonight it is quite close to me -- it seems to me I can almost see you -- hear you speak .
And I can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home .
It has seemed to me ever since I came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world .
"But tonight somehow , all the beautiful things I have always loved seem to have become possible again -- and this is good , and makes me feel a deep , certain , exquisite happiness ."
"It must be autumn at home now -- the harbour is a-dream and the old Glen hills blue with haze , and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over it -- our old `` farewell-summers . ''"
I always liked that name better than ` aster ' -- it was a poem in itself .
"`` Rilla , you know I 've always had premonitions ."
In a month it had carried Walter 's name to every corner of the globe .
"Everywhere it was copied -- in metropolitan dailies and little village weeklies -- in profound reviews and `` agony columns , '' in Red Cross appeals and Government recruiting propaganda ."
"Mothers and sisters wept over it , young lads thrilled to it , the whole great heart of humanity caught it up as an epitome of all the pain and hope and pity and purpose of the mighty conflict , crystallized in three brief immortal verses ."
A Canadian lad in the Flanders trenches had written the one great poem of the war .
"`` The Piper , '' by Pte. ."
"Walter Blythe , was a classic from its first printing ."
Rilla copied it in her diary at the beginning of an entry in which she poured out the story of the hard week that had just passed .
"`` It has been such a dreadful week , '' she wrote , `` and even though it is over and we know that it was all a mistake that does not seem to do away with the bruises left by it ."
And yet it has in some ways been a very wonderful week and I have had some glimpses of things I never realized before -- of how fine and brave people can be even in the midst of horrible suffering .
I am sure I could never be as splendid as Miss Oliver was .
`` Just a week ago today she had a letter from Mr. Grant 's mother in Charlottetown .
And it told her that a cable had just come saying that Major Robert Grant had been killed in action a few days before .
"`` Oh , poor Gertrude !"
At first she was crushed .
Then after just a day she pulled herself together and went back to her school .
"She did not cry -- I never saw her shed a tear -- but oh , her face and her eyes ! '' '"
"I must go on with my work , ' she said ."
` That is my duty just now . '
`` I could never have risen to such a height .
"`` She never spoke bitterly except once , when Susan said something about spring being here at last , and Gertrude said , '' ` Can the spring really come this year ? '"
"`` Then she laughed -- such a dreadful little laugh , just as one might laugh in the face of death , I think , and said , '' ` Observe my egotism ."
"Because I , Gertrude Oliver , have lost a friend , it is incredible that the spring can come as usual ."
"The spring does not fail because of the million agonies of others -- but for mine -- oh , can the universe go on ? ' ''"
"` Do n't feel bitter with yourself , dear , ' mother said gently ."
` It is a very natural thing to feel as if things could n't go on just the same when some great blow has changed the world for us .
We all feel like that . '
`` Then that horrid old Cousin Sophia of Susan 's piped up .
"She was sitting there , knitting and croaking like an old ` raven of bode and woe ' as Walter used to call her . ''"
"` You ai n't as bad off as some , Miss Oliver , ' she said , ` and you should n't take it so hard ."
There 's some as has lost their husbands ; that 's a hard blow ; and there 's some as has lost their sons .
You have n't lost either husband or son . ' ''
"` No , ' said Gertrude , more bitterly still ."
"And how terrible it would be to be doing something you did n't like every day for ... well , say forty years ."
"Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there , or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home ."
"Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor , and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison 's on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store ."
`` She looked like a head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare . ''
"The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk , puffed , frilled , and shirred wherever puff , frill , or shirring could possibly be placed ."
"Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat , bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers ."
"A veil of pink chiffon , lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots , hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her ."
"She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman , and a very strong odor of perfume attended her ."
"`` I am Mrs. DonNELL ... Mrs. H. B. DonNELL , '' announced this vision , `` and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today ."
It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY . ''
"`` I 'm sorry , '' faltered Anne , vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children ."
`` Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell .
"Now , Miss Shirley , the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL ... accent on the last syllable ."
I hope you 'll remember this in future . ''
"`` I 'll try to , '' gasped Anne , choking back a wild desire to laugh ."
`` I know by experience that it 's very unpleasant to have one 's name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong . ''
`` Certainly it is .
And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob . ''
"`` He told me his name was Jacob , '' protested Anne ."
"`` I might well have expected that , '' said Mrs. H. B. Donnell , in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age ."
"`` That boy has such plebeian tastes , Miss Shirley ."
"When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair ... it sounds SO aristocratic , does n't it ?"
But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle .
"I yielded , because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor ."
"And what do you think , Miss Shirley ?"
When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own .
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude ?
"The moment the invitation to the wedding ... for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation , Miss Shirley ... came to the house I said , ` No more Jacobs for me , thank you . '"
From that day I called my son St. Clair and St. Clair I am determined he shall be called .
"His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob , and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name ."
But St. Clair he is and St. Clair he shall remain .
"You will kindly remember this , Miss Shirley , will you not ?"
"`` I do n't reckon there 'd be much amusement in it ... more worry and bother than anything else , I should say ."
It would n't be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you .
I would n't mind Dora so much ... she seems good and quiet .
But that Davy is a limb . ''
Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins .
The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still .
"She knew that Marilla 's only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty , and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line ."
"`` If Davy is naughty it 's all the more reason why he should have good training , is n't it , Marilla ?"
"If we do n't take them we do n't know who will , nor what kind of influences may surround them ."
"Suppose Mrs. Keith 's next door neighbors , the Sprotts , were to take them ."
Mrs. Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you ca n't believe a word his children say .
Would n't it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that ?
Or suppose they went to the Wiggins ' .
Mrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk .
"You would n't like your relations to be starved , even if they were only third cousins , would you ?"
"It seems to me , Marilla , that it is our duty to take them . ''"
"`` I suppose it is , '' assented Marilla gloomily ."
`` I daresay I 'll tell Mary I 'll take them .
"You need n't look so delighted , Anne ."
It will mean a good deal of extra work for you .
"I ca n't sew a stitch on account of my eyes , so you 'll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes ."
And you do n't like sewing . ''
"`` I hate it , '' said Anne calmly , `` but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty ."
It does people good to have to do things they do n't like ... in moderation . ''
"VIII Marilla Adopts Twins Mrs. Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window , knitting a quilt , just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs. Rachel called `` his imported orphan . ''"
"But that had been in springtime ; and this was late autumn , and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown ."
The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill .
Mrs. Rachel peered at it eagerly .
"`` There 's Marilla getting home from the funeral , '' she said to her husband , who was lying on the kitchen lounge ."
"Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do , but Mrs. Rachel , who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household , had not as yet noticed this ."
"`` And she 's got the twins with her , ... yes , there 's Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony 's tail and Marilla jerking him back ."
Dora 's sitting up on the seat as prim as you please .
"Cousin Sophia wanted them to elect Roosevelt , and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance ."
"I had a hankering for him myself , but we must believe that Providence over-rules these matters and be satisfied -- though what the Almighty means in this affair of Rumania I can not fathom -- saying it with all reverence . ''"
Susan fathomed it -- or thought she did -- when the Asquith ministry went down and Lloyd George became Premier .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , Lloyd George is at the helm at last ."
I have been praying for this for many a day .
Now we shall soon see a blessed change .
"It took the Rumanian disaster to bring it about , no less , and that is the meaning of it , though I could not see it before ."
There will be no more shilly-shallying .
"I consider that the war is as good as won , and that I shall tie to , whether Bucharest falls or not . ''"
Bucharest did fall -- and Germany proposed peace negotiations .
Whereat Susan scornfully turned a deaf ear and absolutely refused to listen to such proposals .
When President Wilson sent his famous December peace note Susan waxed violently sarcastic .
"`` Woodrow Wilson is going to make peace , I understand ."
First Henry Ford had a try at it and now comes Wilson .
"But peace is not made with ink , Woodrow , and that you may tie to , '' said Susan , apostrophizing the unlucky President out of the kitchen window nearest the United States ."
"`` Lloyd George 's speech will tell the Kaiser what is what , and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage . ''"
"`` What a pity President Wilson ca n't hear you , Susan , '' said Rilla slyly ."
"`` Indeed , Rilla dear , it is a pity that he has no one near him to give him good advice , as it is clear he has not , in all those Democrats and Republicans , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` I do not know the difference between them , for the politics of the Yankees is a puzzle I can not solve , study it as I may ."
"But as far as seeing through a grindstone goes , I am afraid -- '' Susan shook her head dubiously , `` that they are all tarred with the same brush . ''"
"`` I am thankful Christmas is over , '' Rilla wrote in her diary during the last week of a stormy December ."
`` We had dreaded it so -- the first Christmas since Courcelette .
But we had all the Merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful .
"We were all just quiet and friendly , and that helped ."
"Then , too , I was so thankful that Jims had got better -- so thankful that I almost felt glad -- almost but not quite ."
I wonder if I shall ever feel really glad over anything again .
It seems as if gladness were killed in me -- shot down by the same bullet that pierced Walter 's heart .
Perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soul -- but the old kind will never live again .
`` Winter set in awfully early this year .
Ten days before Christmas we had a big snowstorm -- at least we thought it big at the time .
"As it happened , it was only a prelude to the real performance ."
"It was fine the next day , and Ingleside and Rainbow Valley were wonderful , with the trees all covered with snow , and big drifts everywhere , carved into the most fantastic shapes by the chisel of the northeast wind ."
Something about the firm outlines of Anne 's lips told that Mrs. Rachel was not far astray in this estimate .
Anne 's heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society .
"Gilbert Blythe , who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning , was enthusiastic about it ; and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some `` fun . ''"
"As for what the `` improvements '' were to be , nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert ."
"They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds , if nowhere else ."
Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news .
`` They 've given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant .
"Did n't you go to Queen 's with a girl of that name , Anne ? ''"
"`` Yes , indeed ."
Priscilla to teach at Carmody !
How perfectly lovely ! ''
"exclaimed Anne , her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars , causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not ."
II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her .
"Diana was , of course , a pledged member of the Improvement Society , and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back ."
"`` The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted , '' said Diana , as they drove past the Avonlea hall , a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow , with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides ."
`` It 's a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down .
Father says we 'll never succeed in DOING that .
Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take . ''
"`` Perhaps he 'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood , '' said Anne hopefully ."
`` We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first .
We ca n't expect to improve everything all at once .
"We 'll have to educate public sentiment first , of course . ''"
Diana was n't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant ; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view .
"`` I thought of something last night that we could do , Anne ."
You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet ?
"It 's all grown over with young spruce ; but would n't it be nice to have them all cleared out , and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it ? ''"
"`` Splendid , '' agreed Anne gaily ."
`` And have a rustic seat put under the birches .
And when spring comes we 'll have a flower-bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums . ''
"`` Yes ; only we 'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road , or she 'll eat our geraniums up , '' laughed Diana ."
"`` I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment , Anne ."
There 's the old Boulter house now .
"I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room , and then she said , ` Rob -- is -- living , ' as if the words were torn out of her , and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried ."
I never saw anyone cry so before .
All the tears that she had n't shed all that week came then .
"She cried most of last night , I think , but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind , and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid ."
`` Di and Nan are home for a couple of weeks .
Then they go back to Red Cross work in the training camp at Kingsport .
I envy them .
"Father says I 'm doing just as good work here , with Jims and my Junior Reds ."
But it lacks the romance theirs must have .
`` Kut has fallen .
"It was almost a relief when it did fall , we had been dreading it so long ."
It crushed us flat for a day and then we picked up and put it behind us .
Cousin Sophia was as gloomy as usual and came over and groaned that the British were losing everywhere . ''
"` They 're good losers , ' said Susan grimly ."
` When they lose a thing they keep on looking till they find it again !
"Anyhow , my king and country need me now to cut potato sets for the back garden , so get you a knife and help me , Sophia Crawford ."
It will divert your thoughts and keep you from worrying over a campaign that you are not called upon to run . '
"`` Susan is an old brick , and the way she flattens out poor Cousin Sophia is beautiful to behold ."
"`` As for Verdun , the battle goes on and on , and we see-saw between hope and fear ."
But I know that strange dream of Miss Oliver 's foretold the victory of France .
` They shall not pass . ' ''
"CHAPTER XX NORMAN DOUGLAS SPEAKS OUT IN MEETING `` Where are you wandering , Anne o ' mine ? ''"
"asked the doctor , who even yet , after twenty-four years of marriage , occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about ."
"Anne was sitting on the veranda steps , gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom , Beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries , where the robins were whistling madly ; for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove ."
Anne came back with a little sigh .
"`` I was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream , Gilbert -- a dream that all our children were home again -- and all small again -- playing in Rainbow Valley ."
"It is always so silent now -- but I was imagining I heard clear voices and gay , childish sounds coming up as I used to ."
"I could hear Jem 's whistle and Walter 's yodel , and the twins ' laughter , and for just a few blessed minutes I forgot about the guns on the Western front , and had a little false , sweet happiness . ''"
The doctor did not answer .
"Sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the Western front , but not often ."
There was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago .
"Yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he loved -- the eyes that had once been so full of laughter , and now seemed always full of unshed tears ."
Father and mother went up to Avonlea .
"Father thought the change would do mother good , and they wanted to see poor Aunt Diana , whose son Jock had been seriously wounded a short time before ."
"They left Susan and me to keep house , and father expected to be back the next day ."
But he never got back for a week .
"That night it began to storm again , and it stormed unbrokenly for four days ."
It was the worst and longest storm that Prince Edward Island has known for years .
"Everything was disorganized -- the roads were completely choked up , the trains blockaded , and the telephone wires put entirely out of commission ."
`` And then Jims took ill .
"`` He had a little cold when father and mother went away , and he kept getting worse for a couple of days , but it did n't occur to me that there was danger of anything serious ."
"I never even took his temperature , and I ca n't forgive myself , because it was sheer carelessness ."
The truth is I had slumped just then .
"Mother was away , so I let myself go ."
"All at once I was tired of keeping up and pretending to be brave and cheerful , and I just gave up for a few days and spent most of the time lying on my face on my bed , crying ."
I neglected Jims -- that is the hateful truth -- I was cowardly and false to what I promised Walter -- and if Jims had died I could never have forgiven myself .
"`` Then , the third night after father and mother went away , Jims suddenly got worse -- oh , so much worse -- all at once ."
Susan and I were all alone .
Gertrude had been at Lowbridge when the storm began and had never got back .
At first we were not much alarmed .
Jims has had several bouts of croup and Susan and Morgan and I have always brought him through without much trouble .
But it was n't very long before we were dreadfully alarmed . '' '
"I never saw croup like this before , ' said Susan ."
"`` As for me , I knew , when it was too late , what kind of croup it was ."
I knew it was not the ordinary croup -- ` false croup ' as doctors call it -- but the ` true croup ' -- and I knew that it was a deadly and dangerous thing .
And father was away and there was no doctor nearer than Lowbridge -- and we could not ` phone and neither horse nor man could get through the drifts that night .
"`` Gallant little Jims put up a good fight for his life , -- Susan and I tried every remedy we could think of or find in father 's books , but he continued to grow worse ."
It was heart-rending to see and hear him .
"He gasped so horribly for breath -- the poor little soul -- and his face turned a dreadful bluish colour and had such an agonized expression , and he kept struggling with his little hands , as if he were appealing to us to help him somehow ."
"I found myself thinking that the boys who had been gassed at the front must have looked like that , and the thought haunted me amid all my dread and misery over Jims ."
And all the time the fatal membrane in his wee throat grew and thickened and he could n't get it up .
"`` Oh , I was just wild !"
I never realized how dear Jims was to me until that moment .
And I felt so utterly helpless . ''
Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm . ''
"And he gave it , as he spoke , a wrench that made me cry out ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` it is for yourself I mean ."
The captain is not what he used to be .
He sits with a drawn cutlass .
"Another gentleman -- '' `` Come , now , march , '' interrupted he ; and I never heard a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly as that blind man 's ."
"It cowed me more than the pain , and I began to obey him at once , walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer was sitting , dazed with rum ."
"The blind man clung close to me , holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry ."
"`` Lead me straight up to him , and when I 'm in view , cry out , ` Here 's a friend for you , Bill . '"
"If you do n't , I 'll do this , '' and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint ."
"Between this and that , I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain , and as I opened the parlour door , cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice ."
"The poor captain raised his eyes , and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober ."
The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness .
"He made a movement to rise , but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body ."
"`` Now , Bill , sit where you are , '' said the beggar ."
"`` If I ca n't see , I can hear a finger stirring ."
Business is business .
Hold out your left hand .
"Boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right . ''"
"We both obeyed him to the letter , and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain 's , which closed upon it instantly ."
"`` And now that 's done , '' said the blind man ; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skipped out of the parlour and into the road , where , as I still stood motionless , I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance ."
"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses , but at length , and about at the same moment , I released his wrist , which I was still holding , and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm ."
`` Ten o'clock ! ''
he cried .
`` Six hours .
"We 'll do them yet , '' and he sprang to his feet ."
"Even as he did so , he reeled , put his hand to his throat , stood swaying for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor ."
"I ran to him at once , calling to my mother ."
But haste was all in vain .
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy .
"It is a curious thing to understand , for I had certainly never liked the man , though of late I had begun to pity him , but as soon as I saw that he was dead , I burst into a flood of tears ."
"It was the second death I had known , and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart ."
"People thought the eager , enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used ."
Mrs. Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them .
"Mr. Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense ; and Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the `` Sassiety '' wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they need n't be afraid of her cow , for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds ."
"Even Mr. Harrison chuckled , if he chuckled at all , in private , and was all sympathy outwardly ."
"`` Never mind , Anne ."
"Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with , so it 's bound to fade prettier ."
And the roof is shingled and painted all right .
Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on .
You 've accomplished so much anyhow . ''
"`` But Avonlea 's blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out , '' said Anne bitterly ."
And it must be confessed that it was .
"X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne , walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon , felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing ."
The day had been a good day ; all had gone well in her little kingdom .
St. Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name ; Prillie Rogerson 's face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity .
Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident ... spilling a dipper of water over the floor ... and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all .
`` What a nice month this November has been ! ''
"said Anne , who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself ."
`` November is usually such a disagreeable month ... as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it .
This year is growing old gracefully ... just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles .
We 've had lovely days and delicious twilights .
"This last fortnight has been so peaceful , and even Davy has been almost well-behaved ."
I really think he is improving a great deal .
How quiet the woods are today ... not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops !
It sounds like surf on a faraway shore .
How dear the woods are !
You beautiful trees !
I love every one of you as a friend . ''
Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its cream-white trunk .
"Diana , rounding a curve in the path , saw her and laughed ."
"`` Anne Shirley , you 're only pretending to be grown up ."
I believe when you 're alone you 're as much a little girl as you ever were . ''
"`` Well , one ca n't get over the habit of being a little girl all at once , '' said Anne gaily ."
But this was different .
Perhaps she needed the advice or assistance only he could give .
"To whom else in Bayside could she turn for it but to him , her old friend ?"
Was it possible that she must leave Pinehurst ?
The thought struck cold dismay to his soul .
How could he bear his life if she went away ?
He had loved Sara Stuart from childhood .
"He remembered vividly the day he had first seen her -- a spring day , much like this one had been ; he , a boy of eight , had gone with his father to the big , sunshiny hill field and he had searched for birds ' nests in the little fir copses along the crest while his father plowed ."
"He had so come upon her , sitting on the fence under the pines at the back of Pinehurst -- a child of six in a dress of purple cloth ."
"Her long , light brown curls fell over her shoulders and rippled sleekly back from her calm little brow ; her eyes were large and greyish blue , straight-gazing and steadfast ."
To the end of his life the boy was to carry in his heart the picture she made there under the pines .
"`` Little boy , '' she had said , with a friendly smile , `` will you show me where the mayflowers grow ? ''"
"Shyly enough he had assented , and they set out together for the barrens beyond the field , where the arbutus trailed its stars of sweetness under the dusty dead grasses and withered leaves of the old year ."
The boy was thrilled with delight .
She was a fairy queen who thus graciously smiled on him and chattered blithely as they searched for mayflowers in the fresh spring sunshine .
He thought it a wonderful thing that it had so chanced .
"It overjoyed him to give the choicest dusters he found into her slim , waxen little fingers , and watch her eyes grow round with pleasure in them ."
"When the sun began to lower over the beeches she had gone home with her arms full of arbutus , but she had turned at the edge of the pineland and waved her hand at him ."
"That night , when he told his mother of the little girl he had met on the hill , she had hoped anxiously that he had been `` very polite , '' for the little girl was a daughter of Colonel Stuart , newly come to Pinehurst ."
"Jeffrey , reflecting , had not been certain that he had been polite ; `` But I am sure she liked me , '' he said gravely ."
A few days later a message came from Mrs. Stuart on the hill to Mrs. Miller in the valley .
Would she let her little boy go up now and then to play with Sara ?
Sara was very lonely because she had no playmates .
"So Jeff , overjoyed , had gone to his divinity 's very home , where the two children played together many a day ."
All through their childhood they had been fast friends .
Sara 's parents placed no bar to their intimacy .
They had soon concluded that little Jeff Miller was a very good playmate for Sara .
"He was gentle , well-behaved , and manly ."
Sara never went to the district school which Jeff attended ; she had her governess at home .
"With no other boy or girl in Bayside did she form any friendship , but her loyalty to Jeff never wavered ."
"As for Jeff , he worshipped her and would have done anything she commanded ."
He belonged to her from the day they had hunted arbutus on the hill .
"Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife , and he died without moving ."
"After that he landed on the beach , skinned the wolf , and taking the skin to his cottage , he hung it up before the fire to dry ."
"Not many days later the wolf 's grandmother , who , with the help of her relations , had been searching for him everywhere , entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins ' eggs , and saw the skin , which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . '"
I knew he was dead -- I knew it !
I knew it ! '
"she cried , weeping bitterly , till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet ."
"So , half-blinded by her tears , the old woman went home the way she had come , and running in at the door , she flung herself down in front of the fire ."
` What are you crying for ? '
asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . '
I shall never see my grandson any more ! '
answered she .
"` Mink has killed him , oh !"
oh ! '
"And putting her head down , she began to weep as loudly as ever ."
` There !
there ! '
"said her husband , laying his paw on her shoulder ."
"` Be comforted ; if he IS dead , we will avenge him . '"
And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan .
"It took them a long time to make up their minds , as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house , and that the mink should be invited to the party ."
And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him .
"Now the wolves thought they were very cunning , but the mink was more cunning still ; and though he sent a message by a white hare , that was going that way , saying he should be delighted to be present , he determined that he would take his precautions ."
"So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn , and greeted her with his best bow . '"
"I have a favour to ask of you , friend mouse , ' said he , ` and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . '"
"` The favour is mine , ' answered the mouse ."
` Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . '
"` Oh , something quite easy , ' replied the mink . '"
"I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people , so that directly they use them they will break ."
But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . '
"` Of course , ' answered the mouse , ` nothing is easier ; but as the full moon is to-morrow night , and there is not much time , I had better begin at once . '"
"Then the mink thanked her , and went his way ; but before he had gone far he came back again ."
"` Perhaps , while you are about the wolf 's house seeing after the bows , it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger , ' said he ."
I 'LL keel-haul him ! ''
"All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch , slapping tables with his hand , and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner ."
"My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass , and I watched the cook narrowly ."
"But he was too deep , and too ready , and too clever for me , and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd , and been scolded like thieves , I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver ."
"`` See here , now , Hawkins , '' said he , `` here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ?"
There 's Cap'n Trelawney -- what 's he to think ?
Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum !
Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights !
"Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n ."
"You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
I see that when you first come in .
"Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ?"
"When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now -- '' And then , all of a sudden , he stopped , and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something ."
`` The score ! ''
he burst out .
`` Three goes o ' rum !
"Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! ''"
"And falling on a bench , he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks ."
"I could not help joining , and we laughed together , peal after peal , until the tavern rang again ."
"`` Why , what a precious old sea-calf I am ! ''"
"he said at last , wiping his cheeks ."
"`` You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy ."
"But come now , stand by to go about ."
This wo n't do .
"Dooty is dooty , messmates ."
"I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair ."
"For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit ."
"Nor you neither , says you ; not smart -- none of the pair of us smart ."
But dash my buttons !
That was a good un about my score . ''
"And he began to laugh again , and that so heartily , that though I did not see the joke as he did , I was again obliged to join him in his mirth ."
"On our little walk along the quays , he made himself the most interesting companion , telling me about the different ships that we passed by , their rig , tonnage , and nationality , explaining the work that was going forward -- how one was discharging , another taking in cargo , and a third making ready for sea -- and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly ."
"cried Frank , relenting ."
"`` Now , Jack , make their minds easy before they begin to weep and wail . ''"
`` Left the box outside .
"You tell while I go for it ; '' and Jack bolted , as if afraid the young ladies might be too demonstrative when the tale was told ."
"`` Tell away , '' said Frank , modestly passing the story along to Gus , who made short work of it ."
"`` We rampaged all over the country , and got only that small mess of greens ."
"Knew you 'd be disgusted , and sat down to see what we could do ."
"Then Jack piped up , and said he 'd show us a place where we could get a plenty ."
"` Come on , ' said we , and after leading us a nice tramp , he brought us out at Morse 's greenhouse ."
"So we got a few on tick , as we had but four cents among us , and there you are ."
"Pretty clever of the little chap , was n't it ? ''"
"A chorus of delight greeted Jack as he popped his head in , was promptly seized by his elders and walked up to the table , where the box was opened , displaying gay posies enough to fill most of the baskets if distributed with great economy and much green ."
`` You are the dearest boy that ever was ! ''
"began Jill , with her nose luxuriously buried in the box , though the flowers were more remarkable for color than perfume ."
"`` No , I 'm not ; there 's a much dearer one coming upstairs now , and he 's got something that will make you howl for joy , '' said Jack , ignoring his own prowess as Ed came in with a bigger box , looking as if he had done nothing but go a Maying all his days ."
`` Do n't believe it ! ''
"cried Jill , hugging her own treasure jealously ."
`` It 's only another joke .
"I wo n't look , '' said Molly , still struggling to make her cambric roses bloom again ."
`` I know what it is !
"Oh , how sweet ! ''"
"added Merry , sniffing , as Ed set the box before her , saying pleasantly , -- `` You shall see first , because you had faith . ''"
"Up went the cover , and a whiff of the freshest fragrance regaled the seven eager noses bent to inhale it , as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great , rosy mayflowers that lay before them ."
"`` The dear things , how lovely they are ! ''"
"and Merry looked as if greeting her cousins , so blooming and sweet was her own face ."
"Molly pushed her dingy garlands away , ashamed of such poor attempts beside these perfect works of nature , and Jill stretched out her hand involuntarily , as she said , forgetting her exotics , `` Give me just one to smell of , it is so woodsy and delicious . ''"
"`` Here you are , plenty for all ."
"Real Pilgrim Fathers , right from Plymouth ."
"One of our fellows lives there , and I told him to bring me a good lot ; so he did , and you can do what you like with them , '' explained Ed , passing round bunches and shaking the rest in a mossy pile upon the table ."
`` Ed always gets ahead of us in doing the right thing at the right time .
"Hope you 've got some first-class baskets ready for him , '' said Gus , refreshing the Washingtonian nose with a pink blossom or two ."
"`` Not much danger of his being forgotten , '' answered Molly ; and every one laughed , for Ed was much beloved by all the girls , and his door-steps always bloomed like a flower-bed on May eve ."
`` What can he do ?
He hath but a handful .
"Alack , if it were but to-morrow -- could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow -- all were , I think , otherwise ."
But now there is no help . ''
"`` Well , '' concluded Lawless , `` an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly ."
"It shall naught avail us ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . ''"
"And then , while Dick gave himself over to his reflections , the old rogue curled himself down into a corner , pulled his monkish hood about his face , and composed himself to sleep ."
"Soon he was loudly snoring , so utterly had his long life of hardship and adventure blunted the sense of apprehension ."
"It was long after noon , and the day was already failing , before the door was opened and Dick taken forth and led up-stairs to where , in a warm cabinet , Earl Risingham sat musing over the fire ."
On his captive 's entrance he looked up .
"`` Sir , '' he said , `` I knew your father , who was a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your character ."
"Ye do consort with murderers and robbers ; upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the king 's peace ; ye are suspected to have piratically seized upon a ship ; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy 's house ; a man is slain that very evening -- '' `` An it like you , my lord , '' Dick interposed , `` I will at once avow my guilt , such as it is ."
I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof '' -- searching in his bosom -- `` here is a letter from his wallet . ''
"Lord Risingham took the letter , and opened and read it twice ."
`` Ye have read this ? ''
he inquired .
"`` I have read it , '' answered Dick ."
`` Are ye for York or Lancaster ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` My lord , it was but a little while back that I was asked that question , and knew not how to answer it , '' said Dick ; `` but having answered once , I will not vary ."
"My lord , I am for York . ''"
The earl nodded approvingly .
"`` Honestly replied , '' he said ."
"`` But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? ''"
"`` Nay , but against traitors , my lord , are not all sides arrayed ? ''"
cried Dick .
"`` I would they were , young gentleman , '' returned the earl ; `` and I do at least approve your saying ."
"There is more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and were not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I were half-tempted to espouse your quarrel ."
"For I have inquired , and it appears ye have been hardly dealt with , and have much excuse ."
"But look ye , sir , I am , before all else , a leader in the queen 's interest ; and though by nature a just man , as I believe , and leaning even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my goings for my party 's interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , `` ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel 's faith ?"
Methought he had changed sides intolerably often . ''
"`` Well , I will ; but it 's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest things , '' sighed Daisy ."
"`` A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of , so we must , '' explained Demi , to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were reading about them in school ."
"`` Is Rob coming too , '' asked Daisy ."
"`` Yes , and he is going to bring his toy village ; it is all made of wood , you know , and will burn nicely ."
"We 'll have a grand bonfire , and see them blaze up , wo n't we ? ''"
"This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy , and she ate her dinner with a row of paper dolls before her , as a sort of farewell banquet ."
"At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth , each child bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse ."
"Teddy insisted on going also , and seeing that all the others had toys , he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm , and old Annabella under the other , little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him ."
"`` Where are you going , my chickens ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , as the flock passed her door ."
`` To play by the big rock ; ca n't we ? ''
"`` Yes , only do n't do near the pond , and take good care of baby . ''"
"`` I always do , '' said Daisy , leading forth her charge with a capable air ."
"`` Now , you must all sit round , and not move till I tell you ."
"This flat stone is an altar , and I am going to make a fire on it . ''"
"Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze , as he had seen the boys do at picnics ."
"When the flame burned well , he ordered the company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle ."
"`` I shall begin , and as fast as my things are burnt , you must bring yours . ''"
"With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures , pasted in by himself ; this was followed by a dilapidated boat , and then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death ."
"Not one faltered or hung back , from the splendid red and yellow captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs ; all vanished in the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead ."
"`` Now , Daisy ! ''"
"called the high priest of Kitty-mouse , when his rich offerings had been consumed , to the great satisfaction of the children ."
"`` My dear dollies , how can I let them go ? ''"
"moaned Daisy , hugging the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe ."
"`` You must , '' commanded Demi ; and with a farewell kiss to each , Daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals ."
"`` Let me keep one , the dear blue thing , she is so sweet , '' besought the poor little mamma , clutching her last in despair ."
`` More !
more ! ''
"growled an awful voice , and Demi cried , `` that 's the Kitty-mouse !"
"she must have every one , quick , or she will scratch us . ''"
"In went the precious blue belle , flounces , rosy hat , and all , and nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band ."
"`` Stand the houses and trees round , and let them catch themselves ; it will be like a real fire then , '' said Demi , who liked variety even in his `` sackerryfices . ''"
"Three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home ."
"The turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment ."
Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps .
"He saw the smoke curling through the roof , and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted ."
"He heard the children shouting and calling , and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto , and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return ."
Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street .
"After all , everything was changed ."
Neither men nor houses were those he once knew .
"Quickly he saw his old home ; yes , it was still there , but it had a strange look ."
"Anxiously he knocked at the door , and asked the woman who opened it after his parents ."
"But she did not know their names , and could give him no news of them ."
"Still more disturbed , he rushed to the burying ground , the only place that could tell him what he wished to know ."
Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant .
And he was right .
"In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents , and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son , and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea ."
"And so he found that since he had deft his home , three hundred years had passed by ."
"Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street , hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old ."
"But when the man spoke , he knew he was not dreaming , though he felt as if he had lost his senses ."
In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess .
Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true .
"He might be the victim of some enchanter 's spell , and in his hand lay the counter-charm ."
"Almost unconsciously he opened it , and a purple vapour came pouring out ."
"He held the empty box in his hand , and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled , like the hand of an old , old man ."
"He ran to the brook , which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain ."
and saw himself reflected as in a mirror .
It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him .
"Wounded to death , he crept back through the village , and no man knew the old , old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before ."
"So he toiled wearily back , till he reached the shore , and here he sat sadly on a rock , and called loudly on the turtle ."
"But she never came back any more , but instead , death came soon , and set him free ."
"But before that happened , the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story , and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea , and the most beautiful woman in the world besides ."
The Slaying of the Tanuki From the Japanische Murchen und Sagen .
"Near a big river , and between two high mountains , a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long , long time ago ."
cried his daughter .
"` Well , that is not worth much , my dear , ' said he ."
"` Besides , you have rings enough , I should think . '"
"` Never mind , I like it , ' replied the princess ."
"But as soon as she was alone , to her amazement , the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man ."
"You can imagine how frightened she was , as , indeed , anybody would have been ; but in an instant the man became a ring again , and then turned back to a man , and so it went on for some time until she began to get used to these sudden changes . '"
"I am sorry I frightened you , ' said Hans , when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream . '"
"I took refuge with you because the old hill-man , whom I have offended , was trying to kill me , and here I am safe . '"
"` You had better stay here then , ' said the princess ."
"So Hans stayed , and he and she became good friends ; though , of course , he only became a man when no one else was present ."
"This was all very well ; but , one day , as they were talking together , the king happened to enter the room , and although Hans quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late ."
The king was terribly angry .
` So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand ? '
he cried .
"And , without waiting for her to speak , he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover ."
"That evening the poor princess , still wearing her ring , was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days , and the door was bricked up ."
"But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral , in spite of her bad behaviour , and he had the summer-house opened ."
"He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there , nor Hans either ."
"Instead , there lay at his feet a large hole , big enough for two people to pass through ."
Now what had happened was this .
"When the princess and Hans had given up hope , and cast themselves down on the ground to die , they fell down this hole , and right through the earth as well , and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world , and there they lived happily ."
"But of this , of course , the king knew nothing ."
` Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to ? '
"he asked , turning to his guards and courtiers . '"
I will reward splendidly the man who is brave enough to explore it . '
For a long time nobody answered .
"The hole was dark and deep , and if it had a bottom no one could see it ."
"At length a soldier , who was a careless sort of fellow , offered himself for the service , and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness ."
"But in a moment he , too , fell down , down , down ."
"Was he going to fall for ever , he wondered !"
"Oh , how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle , and to meet the princess and Hans , looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved ."
"They began to talk , and the soldier told them that the king was very sorry for the way he had treated his daughter , and wished day and night that he could have her back again ."
"`` Put up your swords , boys , '' cried the newcomer , `` this man is mine . ''"
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter .
The others drew back and formed a ring around them .
"For long the two enemies looked at one another , Hook shuddering slightly , and Peter with the strange smile upon his face ."
"`` So , Pan , '' said Hook at last , `` this is all your doing . ''"
"`` Ay , James Hook , '' came the stern answer , `` it is all my doing . ''"
"`` Proud and insolent youth , '' said Hook , `` prepare to meet thy doom . ''"
"`` Dark and sinister man , '' Peter answered , `` have at thee . ''"
"Without more words they fell to , and for a space there was no advantage to either blade ."
"Peter was a superb swordsman , and parried with dazzling rapidity ; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe 's defence , but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead , and he could not drive the steel home ."
"Hook , scarcely his inferior in brilliancy , but not quite so nimble in wrist play , forced him back by the weight of his onset , hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust , taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio ; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again ."
"Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook , which all this time had been pawing the air ; but Peter doubled under it and , lunging fiercely , pierced him in the ribs ."
"At the sight of his own blood , whose peculiar colour , you remember , was offensive to him , the sword fell from Hook 's hand , and he was at Peter 's mercy ."
`` Now ! ''
"cried all the boys , but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword ."
"Hook did so instantly , but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form ."
"Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him , but darker suspicions assailed him now ."
"`` Pan , who and what art thou ? ''"
he cried huskily .
"`` I 'm youth , I 'm joy , '' Peter answered at a venture , `` I 'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg . ''"
"This , of course , was nonsense ; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was , which is the very pinnacle of good form ."
"`` To ' t again , '' he cried despairingly ."
"He fought now like a human flail , and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it ; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone ."
And again and again he darted in and pricked .
Hook was fighting now without hope .
That passionate breast no longer asked for life ; but for one boon it craved : to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever .
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it .
"`` In two minutes , '' he cried , `` the ship will be blown to pieces . ''"
"Now , now , he thought , true form will show ."
"But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands , and calmly flung it overboard ."
What sort of form was Hook himself showing ?
"Misguided man though he was , we may be glad , without sympathising with him , that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race ."
"Now , alas !"
it was absolutely finished .
"Oh , dear no !"
` Gracious me ! '
"cried a brass manufacturer , ` there 's no handle on the door , ' and he put one on ."
"An ironmonger added a scraper , and an old lady ran up with a door-mat ."
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
` Finished !
"how can it be finished , ' the plumber demanded scornfully , ` before hot and cold are put in ? '"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower-garden to the right of the verandah , and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Shook his bald head and murmured , ` Cold , quite cold ' -RSB- Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished , and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , ` Tony , ' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but how ever , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else . '
O you darling !
O you sweet !
O you love ! '
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm light was waning too , but it was still there ."
"` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! '"
The name is DONnell and always has been .
"The woman is crazy , that 's what ."
"She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family , eating off a china plate ."
I 'd be afraid of a judgment if I was her .
"Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible , hard-working man , but he had n't much gumption when he picked out a wife , that 's what . ''"
"VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men ... and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills ; a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea ; a long red road , winding through fields and woods , now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces , now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them , now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again , now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters ; air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets , those glad little pensioners of the summer hills ; a plump brown pony ambling along the road ; two girls behind him , full to the lips with the simple , priceless joy of youth and life ."
"`` Oh , this is a day left over from Eden , is n't it , Diana ? ''"
... and Anne sighed for sheer happiness .
`` The air has magic in it .
"Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley , Diana ."
"And oh , do smell the dying fir !"
It 's coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles .
Bliss is it on such a day to be alive ; but to smell dying fir is very heaven .
That 's two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley .
"It does n't seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven , does it ?"
And yet it does n't seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you could n't get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods .
Perhaps we 'll have the odor there without the death .
"Yes , I think that will be the way ."
That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs ... and of course it will be just souls in heaven . ''
"`` Trees have n't souls , '' said practical Diana , `` but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely ."
I 'm going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles .
"You 'd better make one too , Anne . ''"
`` I think I shall ... and use it for my naps .
I 'd be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then .
"But just this minute I 'm well content to be Anne Shirley , Avonlea schoolma'am , driving over a road like this on such a sweet , friendly day . ''"
"`` It 's a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us , '' sighed Diana ."
"`` Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road , Anne ?"
"Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it , and we 'll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves ."
It 's the very worst road of all . ''
`` That is why I chose it .
Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them .
"But you see , Diana , I feel myself responsible for the A.V.I.S. , since I was the first to suggest it , and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things ."
He may not stand alone ; 't is not in nature . ''
"`` They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , '' replied the young lady ."
"`` Ye that fight but for a hazard , what are ye but a butcher ?"
"War is but noble by the cause , and y ' have disgraced it . ''"
"`` Madam , '' said the miserable Dick , `` I do partly see mine error ."
I have made too much haste ; I have been busy before my time .
"Already I stole a ship -- thinking , I do swear it , to do well -- and thereby brought about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger ."
"And for this morning , I did but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold !"
I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me .
"And what besides , I know not ."
"For , alas !"
"I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England ."
"O , madam , I do see my sin ."
I am unfit for life .
"I will , for penance sake and to avoid worse evil , once I have finished this adventure , get me to a cloister ."
I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms .
"I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman 's spirit all my days . ''"
"It appeared to Dick , in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance , that the young lady had laughed ."
"Raising his countenance , he found her looking down upon him , in the fire-light , with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression ."
"`` Madam , '' he cried , thinking the laughter to have been an illusion of his hearing , but still , from her changed looks , hoping to have touched her heart , `` madam , will not this content you ?"
I give up all to undo what I have done amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham .
"And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs , and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground . ''"
"`` O boy , '' she said -- `` good boy ! ''"
"And then , to the extreme surprise of Dick , she first very tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks , and then , as if yielding to a sudden impulse , threw both her arms about his neck , drew up his face , and kissed him ."
A pitiful bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick .
"`` But come , '' she said , with great cheerfulness , `` you that are a captain , ye must eat ."
Why sup ye not ? ''
"`` Dear Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick , `` I did but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food ."
"I were better to fast , dear lady , and to pray . ''"
"`` Call me Alicia , '' she said ; `` are we not old friends ?"
"And now , come , I will eat with you , bit for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . ''"
"So there and then she fell to ; and Dick , who had an excellent stomach , proceeded to bear her company , at first with great reluctance , but gradually , as he entered into the spirit , with more and more vigour and devotion : until , at last , he forgot even to watch his model , and most heartily repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement ."
"remarked Miss Draper , who felt uncomfortably near crying herself ."
`` You might go out and pick a basket of Golden Gems .
I want to make some jelly for Patty . ''
Margaret 's Patient -LSB- Illustration : `` DID DR. FORBES THINK SHE OUGHT TO GIVE UP HER TRIP ? '' -RSB-
Margaret paused a moment at the gate and looked back at the quaint old house under its snowy firs with a thrill of proprietary affection .
"It was her home ; for the first time in her life she had a real home , and the long , weary years of poorly paid drudgery were all behind her ."
Before her was a prospect of independence and many of the delights she had always craved ; in the immediate future was a trip to Vancouver with Mrs. Boyd .
"For I shall go , of course , thought Margaret , as she walked briskly down the snowy road ."
"I 've always wanted to see the Rockies , and to go there with Mrs. Boyd will double the pleasure ."
She is such a delightful companion .
Margaret Campbell had been an orphan ever since she could remember .
"She had been brought up by a distant relative of her father 's -- that is , she had been given board , lodging , some schooling and indifferent clothes for the privilege of working like a little drudge in the house of the grim cousin who sheltered her ."
The death of this cousin flung Margaret on her own resources .
"A friend had procured her employment as the `` companion '' of a rich , eccentric old lady , infirm of health and temper ."
"Margaret lived with her for five years , and to the young girl they seemed treble the time ."
"Her employer was fault-finding , peevish , unreasonable , and many a time Margaret 's patience almost failed her -- almost , but not quite ."
In the end it brought her a more tangible reward than sometimes falls to the lot of the toiler .
"Mrs. Constance died , and in her will she left to Margaret her little up-country cottage and enough money to provide her an income for the rest of her life ."
"Margaret took immediate possession of her little house and , with the aid of a capable old servant , soon found herself very comfortable ."
"She realized that her days of drudgery were over , and that henceforth life would be a very different thing from what it had been ."
Margaret meant to have `` a good time . ''
She had never had any pleasure and now she was resolved to garner in all she could of the joys of existence .
"`` I 'm not going to do a single useful thing for a year , '' she had told Mrs. Boyd gaily ."
"`` Just think of it -- a whole delightful year of vacation , to go and come at will , to read , travel , dream , rest ."
"After that , I mean to see if I can find something to do for other folks , but I 'm going to have this one golden year ."
And the first thing in it is our trip to Vancouver .
I 'm so glad I have the chance to go with you .
"It 's a wee bit short notice , but I 'll be ready when you want to start . ''"
"Altogether , Margaret felt pretty well satisfied with life as she tripped blithely down the country road between the ranks of snow-laden spruces , with the blue sky above and the crisp , exhilarating air all about ."
"There was only one drawback , but it was a pretty serious one ."
"It 's so lonely by spells , Margaret sometimes thought wistfully ."
All the joys my good fortune has brought me ca n't quite fill my heart .
`` Dear life and heart ! ''
"exclaimed Mrs. Emory , pausing in the act of scalding a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door ."
"`` What on earth is the matter , Mr. Murray ?"
"You ai n't sick now , surely ?"
I told you them pond fogs was p ` isen after night !
"If you 've gone and got -- '' `` Nothing is the matter , dear lady , '' interrupted Murray , `` and I have n't gone and got anything except an acute attack of early rising which is not in the least likely to become chronic ."
"But at what hour of the night do you get up , you wonderful woman ?"
Or rather do you ever go to bed at all ?
"Here is the sun only beginning to rise and -- positively yes , you have all your cows milked . ''"
Mrs. Emory purred with delight .
"`` Folks as has fourteen cows to milk has to rise betimes , '' she answered with proud humility ."
"`` Laws , I do n't complain -- I 've lots of help with the milking ."
"How Mrs. Palmer manages , I really can not comperhend -- or rather , how she has managed ."
I suppose she 'll be all right now since her niece came last night .
I saw her posting to the pond pasture not ten minutes ago .
She 'll have to milk all them seven cows herself .
But dear life and heart !
Here I be palavering away and not a bite of breakfast ready for you ! ''
"`` I do n't want any breakfast until the regular time for it , '' assured Murray ."
`` I 'm going down to the pond to see the sun rise . ''
"`` Now do n't you go and get caught in the ma ` sh , '' anxiously called Mrs. Emory , as she never failed to do when she saw him starting for the pond ."
"Nobody ever had got caught in the marsh , but Mrs. Emory lived in a chronic state of fear lest someone should ."
"`` And if you once got stuck in that black mud you 'd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow , '' she was wont to warn her boarders ."
"Murray sought his favourite spot for pond dreaming -- a bloomy corner of the pasture that ran down into the blue water , with a dump of leafy maples on the left ."
He was very glad he had risen early .
A miracle was being worked before his very eyes .
"The world was in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness , instinct with all the marvellous fleeting charm of girlhood and spring and young morning ."
Overhead the sky was a vast high-sprung arch of unstained crystal .
"Down over the sand dunes , where the pond ran out into the sea , was a great arc of primrose smitten through with auroral crimsonings ."
"Beneath it the pond waters shimmered with a hundred fairy hues , but just before him they were clear as a flawless mirror ."
"The fields around him glistened with dews , and a little wandering wind , blowing lightly from some bourne in the hills , strayed down over the slopes , bringing with it an unimaginable odour and freshness , and fluttered over the pond , leaving a little path of dancing silver ripples across the mirror-glory of the water ."
"Birds were singing in the beech woods over on Orchard Knob Farm , answering to each other from shore to shore , until the very air was tremulous with the elfin music of this wonderful midsummer dawn ."
"'T was Bennet Hatch that burned it , now five years agone ."
"In sooth , 't was pity , for it was a fair house . ''"
"Down in the hollow , where no wind blew , it was both warm and still ; and Matcham , laying one hand upon Dick 's arm , held up a warning finger ."
`` Hist ! ''
he said .
"Then came a strange sound , breaking on the quiet ."
It was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature .
"It was the sound of a big man clearing his throat ; and just then a hoarse , untuneful voice broke into singing ."
"`` Then up and spake the master , the king of the outlaws : ` What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? '"
"And Gamelyn made answer -- he looked never adown : ` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town ! ' ''"
"The singer paused , a faint clink of iron followed , and then silence ."
The two lads stood looking at each other .
"Whoever he might be , their invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin ."
"And suddenly the colour came into Matcham 's face , and next moment he had crossed the fallen rafter , and was climbing cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that filled the interior of the roofless house ."
"Dick would have withheld him , had he been in time ; as it was , he was fain to follow ."
"Right in the corner of the ruin , two rafters had fallen crosswise , and protected a clear space no larger than a pew in church ."
Into this the lads silently lowered themselves .
"There they were perfectly concealed , and through an arrow-loophole commanded a view upon the farther side ."
"Peering through this , they were struck stiff with terror at their predicament ."
To retreat was impossible ; they scarce dared to breathe .
"Upon the very margin of the ditch , not thirty feet from where they crouched , an iron caldron bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire ; and close by , in an attitude of listening , as though he had caught some sound of their clambering among the ruins , a tall , red-faced , battered-looking man stood poised , an iron spoon in his right hand , a horn and a formidable dagger at his belt ."
"Plainly this was the singer ; plainly he had been stirring the caldron , when some incautious step among the lumber had fallen upon his ear ."
"A little further off , another man lay slumbering , rolled in a brown cloak , with a butterfly hovering above his face ."
"All this was in a clearing white with daisies ; and at the extreme verge , a bow , a sheaf of arrows , and part of a deer 's carcase , hung upon a flowering hawthorn ."
"Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention , raised the spoon to his mouth , tasted its contents , nodded , and then fell again to stirring and singing . ''"
"` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town , ' '' he croaked , taking up his song where he had left it ."
"`` O , sir , we walk not here at all an evil thing to do ."
But if we meet with the good king 's deer to shoot a shaft into . ''
"Still as he sang , he took from time to time , another spoonful of the broth , blew upon it , and tasted it , with all the airs of an experienced cook ."
"At length , apparently , he judged the mess was ready ; for taking the horn from his girdle , he blew three modulated calls ."
"The other fellow awoke , rolled over , brushed away the butterfly , and looked about him ."
"`` How now , brother ? ''"
"My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine ."
"What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell ."
It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not .
But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand .
"I was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript ."
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not .
"Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and I turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats ."
"Instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off ."
"I was tired , at any rate ; but had I been as fresh as when I rose , I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary ."
"From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that I had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran ."
"Yet a man it was , I could no longer be in doubt about that ."
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals .
I was within an ace of calling for help .
"But the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion ."
"I stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as I was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind ."
"As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him ."
"He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me ."
"Then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication ."
At that I once more stopped .
`` Who are you ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ben Gunn , '' he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock ."
"`` I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . ''"
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing .
"His skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face ."
"Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness ."
"He was clothed with tatters of old ship 's canvas and old sea-cloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin ."
"About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement ."
`` Three years ! ''
I cried .
`` Were you shipwrecked ? ''
"`` Nay , mate , '' said he ; `` marooned . ''"
"He was on the point of turning homeward , with an unreasoning sense of disappointment , when one of Lynde 's dogs broke down through the hedge of spruces , barking loudly ."
"Alan looked for Lynde to follow , but she did not , and he speedily saw that there was something unusual about the dog 's behaviour ."
"The animal circled around him , still barking excitedly , then ran off for a short distance , stopped , barked again , and returned , repeating the manoeuvre ."
"It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him , and it occurred to the young minister that the dog 's mistress must be in danger of some kind ."
"Instantly he set off after him ; and the dog , with a final sharp bark of satisfaction , sprang up the low bank into the spruces ."
"Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further shore , which rapidly grew steep and high ."
"Half a mile down the cliffs were rocky and precipitous , while the beach beneath them was heaped with huge boulders ."
Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four Winds .
"Then the animal halted , ran to the edge of the cliff and barked ."
"It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently broken away recently , and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and looked down ."
He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm .
"A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of rock , below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel boulders below ."
"The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a glance ; the soil on which she lay was stationary , yet it seemed as if the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink ."
"Lynde lay movelessly ; her face was white , and both fear and appeal were visible in her large dilated eyes ."
Yet she was quite calm and a faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog .
"`` Good faithful Pat , so you did bring help , '' she said ."
"`` But how can I help you , Miss Oliver ? ''"
said Alan hoarsely .
`` I can not reach you -- and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send that broken earth over the brink . ''
`` I fear it would .
You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope . ''
`` And leave you here alone -- in such danger ? ''
`` Pat will stay with me .
"Besides , there is nothing else to do ."
You will find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily .
Father and Emily are away .
I think I am quite safe here if I do n't move at all . ''
"Alan 's own common sense told him that , as she said , there was nothing else to do and , much as he hated to leave her alone thus , he realized that he must lose no time in doing it ."
"`` I 'll be back as quickly as possible , '' he said hurriedly ."
Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not forgotten their old training .
"Yet it seemed to him an age ere he reached Four Winds , secured the rope , and returned ."
At every flying step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could rescue her .
"She was the cannibal of the seas , and scarce needed that watchful eye , for she floated immune in the horror of her name ."
"She was wrapped in the blanket of night , through which no sound from her could have reached the shore ."
"There was little sound , and none agreeable save the whir of the ship 's sewing machine at which Smee sat , ever industrious and obliging , the essence of the commonplace , pathetic Smee ."
"I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic , unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it ; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him , and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook 's tears and made it flow ."
"Of this , as of almost everything else , Smee was quite unconscious ."
"A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks , drinking in the miasma -LSB- putrid mist -RSB- of the night ; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards ; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck , where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook 's reach , lest he should claw them mechanically in passing ."
Hook trod the deck in thought .
O man unfathomable .
It was his hour of triumph .
"Peter had been removed for ever from his path , and all the other boys were in the brig , about to walk the plank ."
"It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel ; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man , could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily , bellied out by the winds of his success ?"
"But there was no elation in his gait , which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind ."
Hook was profoundly dejected .
He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night .
It was because he was so terribly alone .
This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs .
They were socially inferior to him .
Hook was not his true name .
"To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze ; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed , he had been at a famous public school ; and its traditions still clung to him like garments , with which indeed they are largely concerned ."
"Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled -LSB- attacked -RSB- her , and he still adhered in his walk to the school 's distinguished slouch ."
But above all he retained the passion for good form .
Good form !
"However much he may have degenerated , he still knew that this is all that really matters ."
"From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals , and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap , like hammering in the night when one can not sleep ."
`` Have you been good form to-day ? ''
was their eternal question .
"`` Fame , fame , that glittering bauble , it is mine , '' he cried ."
`` Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything ? ''
the tap-tap from his school replied .
"`` I am the only man whom Barbecue feared , '' he urged , `` and Flint feared Barbecue . ''"
"`` Barbecue , Flint -- what house ? ''"
came the cutting retort .
THE UNDECIDED RATTLESNAKE
"It is not often that one of the Forest People has any trouble about making up his mind, but there was one large Rattlesnake who had great difficulty in doing so. She lived in the southern edge of the forest, where the sunshine was clear and warm, and there were delightful crevices among the rocks in which she and all her friends and relatives could hide."
"It seemed very strange that so old a Snake should be so undecided as she was. It must be that she had a careless mother who did not bring her up in the right way. If that were so, one should indeed be sorry for her."
"Still even that would be no real excuse, for was she not old enough now to train herself? She had seven joints in the rattle on her tail and an eighth one growing, so you can see that she was no longer young, although, being healthy, she had grown her new joints and changed her skin oftener than some of her friends. In fact, she had grown children of her own, and if it had not been that they took after their father, they would have been a most helpless family. Fortunately for them, their father was a very decided Snake."
"Yes, it was exceedingly lucky for them. It may not have been so good a thing for him. His wife was always glad to have things settled for her, and when he said, ""We will do this,"" she answered, ""Yes, dear."" When he said, ""We will not do that,"" she murmured, ""No, dear."" And when he said, ""What shall we do?"" she would reply, ""Oh, I don't know. What do you think we might better do?"" He did not very often ask her opinion, and there were people in the forest who said he would never have talked matters over with her if he had not known that she would leave the decision to him."
"Now this is a bad way in which to have things go in any family, and it happened here as it would anywhere. He grew more and more selfish from having his own way all of the time, and his wife became less and less able to take care of herself. Most people thought him a very devoted husband. Perhaps he was. It is easy to be a devoted husband if you always have your own way."
"One night Mr. Rattlesnake did not return to their home. Nobody ever knew what had become of him. The Red Squirrel said that Mrs. Goldfinch said that the biggest little Rabbit had told her that the Ground Hog had overheard Mr. Crow say that he thought he saw somebody that looked like Mr. Rattlesnake chasing a Field Mouse over toward the farm, but that he might have been mistaken. This was all so uncertain that Mrs."
Rattlesnake knew no more than she had known before. It was very trying.
"""If I only knew positively,"" she said to her friend, Mrs. Striped Snake, ""I could do something, although I am sure I don't know what it would be."""
"Mrs. Striped Snake tried to help her. ""Why not have one of your children come home to live with you?"" she said pleasantly, for this year's children were now old enough to shift for themselves."
"""I've thought of that,"" answered Mrs. Rattlesnake, ""but I like a quiet life, and you know how it is. Young Snakes will be young Snakes."
"Besides, I don't think they would want to come back."""
"""Well, why not be alone, then?"""
"""Oh, it is so lonely,"" replied Mrs. Rattlesnake, with a sigh."
"""Everything reminds me so of my husband, and that makes me sad. If I lived somewhere else it would be different."""
"""Then why not move?"" said Mrs. Striped Snake, briskly. ""I would do that."
"Find a nice crack in the rock just big enough for one, or make a cosy little hole in the ground somewhere near here. Then if he comes back he can find you easily. I would do that. I certainly would."""
"She spoke so firmly that Mrs. Rattlesnake said she would, she would to-morrow. And her friend went home thinking it was all settled. That shows how little she really knew Mrs. Rattlesnake."
"The more Mrs. Rattlesnake thought it over that night, the more she dreaded moving. ""If he does not come back,"" she sighed, ""I may marry again in the spring, and then I might have to move once more. I believe I will ask somebody else what I ought to do."""
"So in the morning she began to consult her friends. They all told her to move, and she decided to do it. Then she could not make up her mind whether to take a rock-crevice or make a hole in the ground. It took another day of visiting to settle that it should be a hole in the ground. A fourth day was spent in finding just the right place for her home, and on the fifth day she began work."
"By the time the sun was over the tree-tops, she wished she had chosen some other place, and thought best to stop and talk to some of her friends about it. When she returned she found herself obliged to cast her skin, which had been growing tight and dry for some time. This was hard work, and she was too tired to go on with her home-making, so she lay in the sunshine and admired her beautiful, long, and shining body of reddish brown spotted with black. Her rattle had eight joints now, for when a Rattlesnake casts the old skin a new joint is always uncovered at the end of the tail. She waved it quickly to see how an eight-jointed rattle would sound. ""Lovely!"" she said. ""Lovely! Like the seeds of the wild cucumber shaking around in their dry and prickly case."""
"One could not tell all the things that happened that fall, or how very, very, very tired her friends became of having her ask their advice. She changed her mind more times than there are seeds in a milkweed pod, and the only thing of which she was always sure was eating. When there was food in sight she did not stop for anybody's advice. She ate it as fast as she could, and if she had any doubts about the wisdom of doing so, she kept them to herself."
"When winter came she had just got her new home ready, and after all she went when invited to spend the winter with a cave party of other Snakes."
"They coiled themselves together in a great mass and slept there until spring. As the weather grew warmer, they began to stir, wriggling and twisting themselves free."
Two bachelor Snakes asked her to marry. One was a fine old fellow with a twelve-jointed rattle. The other was just her own age.
"""To be sure I will,"" she cried, and the pits between her nostrils and her ears looked more like dimples than ever. ""Only you must wait until I can make up my mind which one to marry."""
"""Oh, no,"" they answered, ""don't go to all that trouble. We will fight and decide it for you."""
"It was a long fight, and the older of the two Snakes had a couple of joints broken off from his rattle before it was over. Still he beat the other one and drove him away. When he came back for his bride he found her crying. ""What is the matter?"" said he, quite sternly."
"""Oh, that p-poor other b-bachelor!"" she sobbed. ""I b-believe I will g-go after him. I think p-perhaps I l-love him the b-better."""
"""No, you don't, Mrs. Rattlesnake,"" said the fine old fellow who had just won the fight. ""You will do no such thing. You will marry me and never speak to him again. When I have lost two joints of my rattle in fighting for you, I intend to have you myself, and I say that you love me very dearly. Do you hear?"""
"""Yes, darling,"" she answered, as she wiped her eyes on the grass, ""very dearly."" And they lived most happily together."
"""He reminds me so much of the first Mr. Rattlesnake,"" she said to her friends. ""So strong, so firm, so quick to decide!"""
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter."
"It was then that he saw The Book of Beasts lying on the pebbles, open at the page with ""Dragon"" written at the bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in."
"As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang."
"""Oh, hurrah!"" he cried. ""Now we really have done it."""
And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.
"""Oh, my precious Hippogriff,"" he cried. ""You are the bravest, dearest, most beautiful """
"""Hush,"" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. ""Don't you see that we are not alone?"""
"And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the Dragon to take them into the book with him it was a tight fit even for one Dragon so, of course, he had to leave them outside."
"They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after."
"When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the book. ""I do not care for public life,"""
he said.
"Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:"
"That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because there was no room for them in the book and the milk cans too."
"Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. ""I should like,"" he said, ""to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at me."""
"So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with."
"As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own Rocking Horse a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day."
"II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger"
The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.
"""What will you do when you grow up, Princess?"" asked the gardener's boy."
"""I should like to marry you, Tom,"" said the Princess. ""Would you mind?"""
"""No,"" said the gardener's boy. ""I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if you like if I have time."""
"For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class."
"As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really are done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear."
"When the Princess had been good all through the week for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never bad Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: ""Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?"" just as if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:"
"""Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep."""
"So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose."
"There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was kind except one."
"Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a thoughtful child as of course you are you will not need me to tell you what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a thoughtful child and it is just possible of course that you are not I will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. All the animals were the wrong sizes! And this was how it happened."
"In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big spinning top."
"I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite lively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a fairy tale like the powder in jam."
"Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the air which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of the things only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently Center of Gravity a great giant who was managing the whole business woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble."
"""Oh, I'm so fond of you, I couldn't help doing it when I knew that your heart lay there,"" said the Princess."
"""How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing?"" said the Giant."
"""Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when you say it?"" said the Princess."
"""You're a goose,"" said the Giant; ""where my heart is, you will never come."""
"""Well,"" said the Princess; ""but for all that, 'twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies."""
"Then the poor Giant could hold out no longer, but was forced to say:"
"""Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck; in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart, you darling!"""
"In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the Giant strode off to the wood."
"""Yes! now I must set off too,"" said Boots; ""if I only knew how to find the way."" He took a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant's door, there stood the Wolf waiting for him. So Boots told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he only knew the way. So the Wolf bade him jump on his back, he'd soon find the way; and away they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and dale. After they had travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not know how to get over it, but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid, but stick on, and so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back, and swam over to the island. So they came to the church; but the church keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down."
"""You must call on the raven,"" said the Wolf."
"So the Prince called on the raven, and in a trice the raven came, and flew up and fetched the keys, and so the Prince got into the church. But when he came to the well, there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and forwards, just as the Giant had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in his hand; but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well, and then Boots was beside himself to know how to get it out again."
"""Well, now you must call on the salmon to be sure,"" said the Wolf; and the king's son called on the salmon, and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well."
"Then the Wolf told him to squeeze the egg, and as soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out."
"""Squeeze it again,"" said the Wolf; and when the Prince did so, the Giant screamed still more piteously, and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared, saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in two."
"""Tell him, if he will restore to life again your six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his life,"""
"said the Wolf. Yes, the Giant was ready to do that, and he turned the six brothers into king's sons again, and their brides into king's daughters."
"""Now, squeeze the egg in two,"" said the Wolf. So Boots squeezed the egg to pieces, and the Giant burst at once."
"Now, when he had made an end of the Giant, Boots rode back again on the Wolf to the Giant's house, and there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then Boots went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they all set off home again to their father's house. And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride ""But the loveliest bride of all is the bride of Boots, after all,"" said the king, ""and he shall sit uppermost at the table, with her by his side."""
"So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not done feasting, why, they are still at it."
THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL
"Once on a time there was a man who had a meadow, which lay high up on the hill-side, and in the meadow was a barn, which he had built to keep his hay in. Now, I must tell you, there hadn't been much in the barn for the last year or two, for every St. John's night, when the grass stood greenest and deepest, the meadow was eaten down to the very ground the next morning, just as if a whole drove of sheep had been there feeding on it over night. This happened once, and it happened twice; so at last the man grew weary of losing his crop of hay, and said to his sons for he had three of them, and the youngest was nicknamed Boots, of course that now one of them must go and sleep in the barn in the outlying field when St. John's night came, for it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten, root and blade, this year, as it had been the last two years. So whichever of them went must keep a sharp look-out; that was what their father said."
"Well, the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow; trust him for looking after the grass! It shouldn't be his fault if man or beast, or the fiend himself, got a blade of grass. So, when evening came, he set off to the barn, and lay down to sleep; but a little on in the night came such a clatter, and such an earthquake, that walls and roof shook, and groaned, and creaked; then up jumped the lad, and took to his heels as fast as ever he could; nor dared he once look round till he reached home; and as for the hay, why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before."
"The next St. John's night, the man said again, it would never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after year in this way, so one of his sons must just trudge off to watch it, and watch it well too. Well, the next oldest son was ready to try his luck, so he set off, and lay down to sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him; but as the night wore on, there came on a rumbling and quaking of the earth, worse even than on the last St. John's night, and when the lad heard it, he got frightened, and took to his heels as though he were running a race."
"Next year the turn came to Boots; but when he made ready to go, the other two began to laugh and to make game of him, saying:"
"""You're just the man to watch the hay, that you are; you, who have done nothing all your life but sit in the ashes and toast yourself by the fire."""
"But Boots did not care a pin for their chattering, and stumped away as evening grew on, up the hill-side to the outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay down; but in about an hour's time the barn began to groan and creak, so that it was dreadful to hear."
"""Well,"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I can stand it well enough."""
"A little while after came another creak and an earthquake, so that the litter in the barn flew about the lad's ears. ""Oh!"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I daresay I can stand it out."""
"But just then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming down on his head; but it passed off, and all was still as death about him."
"""You come rather sharply,"" said the soldier."
"""As you whistle so I come,"" answered the eagle. So he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were."
"""You can't get away from here unless you can fly,"" said the eagle, ""but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and help you. Have you got a knife?"""
"""No, but I have a sword,"" he said. When the eagle had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill one more for victuals on the journey. ""Every time I gape you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,"" she said, ""else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth."""
"He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagle's mouth every time she opened it."
"At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by sea and land wherever they went."
"Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once."
"In the meantime everything was ready at the palace, and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant were to be married with the two eldest Princesses, who, however, were not much happier than their youngest sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning, and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more sorrowful did they become."
"At last the King asked what was the matter with them; he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. They had to give some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as they had played with in the blue mountain."
"That, thought the King, could be easily managed, and so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in the country that they should make these checkers for the Princesses. For all they tried there was no one who could make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the King that he would undertake to make the checkers for the Princesses."
"He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the King heard there was some one outside who could make the checkers he was not long in coming out."
"""Is it true what you say, that you can make such checkers as my daughters want?"" he asked."
"""Yes, it is no lie,"" said the goldsmith; that he would answer for."
"""That's well!"" said the King. ""Here is the gold to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself, and they must be finished in three days."""
"The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he was drunk. The best thing would be to make short work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could do it?"
"""Don't fret on that account,"" said the soldier, ""but let me have the gold and I'll get the checkers ready in time; but I must have a room to myself to work in,"" he said. This he got, and thanks into the bargain."
"The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because he would not begin with the work."
"""Don't worry yourself about it,"" said the soldier, ""there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with what I have promised you had better make them yourself."" The same thing went on both that day and the next; and when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the soldier's room the whole of the last day, he quite gave himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer about saving his life, he thought."
But when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and asked what he wanted.
"""Those gold checkers, which the Princesses had in the blue mountain,"" said the soldier; ""but you'll want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder; you had better finish them,"" he said. When the eagle had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun rose she was back again with the checkers. The soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep."
Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door.
"""What are you after now again?"" asked the soldier. ""You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows! If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever would be an apprentice here?"" said he."
"Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was let in."
"And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end to his wailing."
"But still more glad than the goldsmith were the Princesses, when he came up to the palace with the checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest Princess."
"""Have you made them yourself?"" she asked."
"""No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,"" he said, ""but my apprentice, who has made them."""
"""I should like to see that apprentice,"" said the Princess. In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his life, he would have to come."
"He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk, said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure."
"The youngest Princess recognised him at once; she pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her hand, and said:"
"""Good day, and many thanks for all you have done for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the mountain,"" she said to the King. ""He is the one I will have!"" and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair."
"It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom, and married the youngest Princess."
"""I'm going to try if I can find the Princesses,"" answered the soldier."
"""So are we,"" said the captain, ""and since your errand is the same, you may keep company with us, for if we don't find them, you are not likely to find them either, my lad,"" said he."
"When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high road, and took a path into the forest."
"""Where are you going?"" said the captain; ""it is best to follow the high road."""
"""That may be,"" said the soldier, ""but this is my way."""
"He kept to the path, and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him. Away they went further and further, far across big moors and along narrow valleys."
"And at last it became lighter, and when they had got out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge, which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came towards them, as if he wanted to eat them."
"""What shall we do now?"" said the captain."
"""They say that the bear is fond of meat,"" said the soldier, and then he threw a fore quarter to him, and so they got past. But when they reached the other end of the bridge, they saw a lion, which came roaring towards them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them."
"""I think we had better turn right-about, we shall never be able to get past him alive,"" said the captain."
"""Oh, I don't think he is so very dangerous,"" said the soldier; ""I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon, and I have half a pig in my wallet;"" and then he threw a ham to the lion, who began eating and gnawing, and thus they got past him also."
"In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each room was more gorgeous than the other; all was glitter and splendour wherever they looked; but that did not satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant went round rattling their money, and wanted to buy some food; but they saw no people nor could they find a crumb of anything in the house, so the soldier offered them some food from his wallet, which they were not too proud to accept, nor did they want any pressing. They helped themselves of what he had as if they had never tasted food before."
The next day the captain said they would have to go out shooting and try to get something to live upon. Close to the house was a large forest where there were plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain at home and cook the remainder of the food in the soldier's wallet. In the meantime the captain and the soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to carry it home. When they came to the door they found the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely able to open the door to them.
"""What is the matter with you?"" said the captain. The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were gone a tiny, little man, with a long beard, who went on crutches, came in and asked so plaintively for a penny; but no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor, and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was not able to get hold of it, so stiff and stark was he."
"""I pitied the poor, old body,"" said the lieutenant, ""and so I bent down to pick up the penny, but then he was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable to move a limb."""
"""You ought to be ashamed of yourself! you, one of the king's officers, to let an old cripple give you a thrashing, and then tell people of it into the bargain!"" said the captain. ""Pshaw! to-morrow I'll stop at home, and then you'll hear another story."""
The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out shooting and the captain remained at home to do the cooking and look after the house.
"But if he fared no worse, he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant. In a little while the old man came in and asked for a penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it; gone it was and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help him to find it, and the captain, without giving a thought, bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his crutches, and every time the captain tried to rise, he got a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came home in the evening, he still lay on the same spot and could neither see nor speak."
"The third day the soldier was to remain at home, while the other two went out shooting. The captain said he must take care of himself, ""for the old fellow will soon put an end to you, my lad,"" said he."
"""Oh, there can't be much life in one if such an old crook can take it,"" said the soldier."
"They were no sooner outside the door, than the old man came in and asked for a penny again."
"""Money I have never owned,"" said the soldier, ""but food I'll give you, as soon as it is ready,"" said he, ""but if we are to get it cooked, you must go and cut the wood."""
"""That I can't,"" said the old man."
"""If you can't, you must learn,"" said the soldier. ""I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the wood-shed."" There he dragged out a heavy log and cut a cleft in it, and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened."
"""Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft, and you'll soon learn how to cut wood,"" said the soldier. ""In the meantime I'll show you how to use the axe."""
"The old man was not sufficiently cunning, and did as he was told; he lay down and looked steadily along the log. When the soldier saw the old man's beard had got well into the cleft, he struck out the wedge; the cleft closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The soldier began to beat him with the axe handle, and then swung the axe round his head, and vowed that he would split his skull if he did not tell him, there and then, where the Princesses were."
"""Spare my life, spare my life, and I'll tell you!"" said the old man."
"""To the east of the house there is a big mound; on top of the mound you must dig out a square piece of turf, and then you will see a big stone slab. Under that there is a deep hole through which you must let yourself down, and you'll then come to another world where you will find the Princesses. But the way is long and dark and it goes both through fire and water."""
"When the soldier got to know this, he released the old man, who was not long in making off."
"When the captain and lieutenant came home they were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them what had happened from first to last, where the Princesses were and how they should find them. They became as pleased as if they had already found them, and when they had had some food, they took with them a basket and as much rope as they could find, and all three set off to the mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old man had told them, and underneath they found a big stone slab, which it took all their strength to turn over."
"They then began to measure how deep it was; they joined on ropes both two and three times, but they were no nearer the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had to join all the ropes they had, both the coarse and fine, and then they found it reached the bottom."
"The captain was, of course, the first who wanted to descend; ""But when I tug at the rope you must make haste to drag me up again,"" he said."
"""There were domes of white blossoms where swelled the white tent;   There were ploughs in the track where the war-wagons went;   There were songs where they lifted up Rachel's lament."""
"October 8, 1871, occurred the great fire in Chicago, raging for forty-eight hours and devastating three thousand acres of the city."
"Twenty-five thousand buildings were burned, and two hundred million dollars' worth of property. One hundred thousand people lost their houses, and over seven and one-half millions of dollars were raised for those who needed it, all parts of the world uniting to improve the joyful opportunity to do good, without a doubt of its hearty appreciation."
"Boston also had a seventy-million dollar fire in the heart of the wholesale trade, covering sixty acres; and in the prairie and woods fires of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, many people lost not only their homes but their lives. Fifteen hundred people perished in Wisconsin alone."
"In 1871 the damage done by the Alabama, a British-built ship, and several other cruisers sent out partly to facilitate the cotton trade and partly to do a little fighting when a Federal vessel came that way, was assessed at fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars against Great Britain by the arbitrators who met at Geneva, Switzerland, and the northwestern boundary line between the United States and British America was settled by arbitration, the Emperor of Germany acting as arbitrator and deciding in favor of America."
"This showed that people who have just wound up a big war have often learned some valuable sense; not two billion dollars' worth, perhaps, but some."
"San Domingo was reported for sale, and a committee looked at it, priced it, etc., but Congress decided not to buy it."
"The Liberal Republican party, or that element of the original party which was opposed to the administration, nominated Horace Greeley, of New York, while the old party renominated General Grant for the term to succeed himself. The latter was elected, and Mr. Greeley did not long survive his defeat."
"The Modoc Indians broke loose in the early part of Grant's second term, and, leaping from their lava-beds early in the morning, Shacknasty Jim and other unlaundried children of the forest raised merry future punishment, and the government, always kind, always loving and sweet toward the red brother, sent a peace commission with popcorn balls and a gentle-voiced parson to tell Shacknasty James and Old Stand-up-and-Sit-down that the white father at Washington loved them and wanted them all to come and spend the summer at his house, and also that by sin death came into the world, and that we were all primordial germs at first, and that we should look up, not down, look out, not in, look forward, not backward, and lend a hand."
"It was at this moment that Early-to-Bed-and Early-to-Rise-Black Hawk and Shacknasty James, thinking that this thing had gone far enough, killed General Canby and wounded both Mr. Meacham and Rev. Dr. Thomas, who had never had an unkind thought toward the Modocs in their lives."
"The troops then allowed their ill temper to get the best of them, and asked the Modocs if they meant anything personal by their action, and, learning that they did, the soldiers did what with the proper authority they would have done at first, bombarded the children of the forest and mussed up their lava-beds so that they were glad to surrender."
"In 1873 a panic occurred after the failure of Jay Cooke & Co., of Philadelphia, and a money stringency followed, the Democrats attributing it a good deal to the party in power, just as cheap Republicans twenty years later charged the Democratic administration with this same thing."
"Inconsistency of this kind keeps good men, like the writer, out of politics, and turns their attention toward the contemplation of a better land."
"In 1875 Centennial Anniversaries began to ripen and continued to fall off the different branches of government, according to the history of events so graphically set forth in the preceding pages. They were duly celebrated by a happy and self-made people. The Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 was a marked success in every way, nearly ten millions of people having visited it, who claimed that it was well worth the price of admission."
"Aside from the fact that these ten millions of people had talked about it to millions of folks at home, or thought they had, the Exposition was a boon to every one, and thousands of Americans went home with a knowledge of their country that they had never had before, and pointers on blowing out gas which saved many lives in after-years."
CHAPTER XXXI.
CLOSING CHRONICLES.
"In 1876 the peaceful Sioux took an outing, having refused to go to their reservation in accordance with the treaty made with the Great Father at Washington, D. C., and regular troops were sent against them."
"General Custer, with the 7th Regiment, led the advance, and General Terry aimed for the rear of the children of the forest up the Big Horn."
"Here, on the 25th of June, without assistance, and with characteristic courage, General Custer attacked the enemy, sending Colonel Reno to fall on the rear of the village."
"Scarcely enough of Custer's own command with him at the time lived long enough to tell the story of the battle. General Custer, his two brothers, and his nephew were among the dead. Reno held his ground until reinforced, but Custer's troops were exterminated."
"It is said that the Sioux rose from the ground like bunch-grass and swarmed up the little hill like a pest of grasshoppers, mowing down the soldiers with the very newest and best weapons of warfare, and leaving nothing at last but the robbed and mutilated bodies lying naked in the desolate land of the Dakotah."
"The Fenimore Cooper Indian is no doubt a brave and highly intellectual person, educated abroad, refined and cultivated by foreign travel, graceful in the grub dance or scalp walk-around, yet tender-hearted as a girl, walking by night fifty-seven miles in a single evening to warn his white friends of danger. The Indian introduced into literature was a bronze Apollo who bathed almost constantly and only killed white people who were unpleasant and coarse. He dressed in new and fresh buckskins, with trimming of same, and his sable hair hung glossy and beautiful down the coppery billows of muscles on his back."
"The real Indian has the dead and unkempt hair of a busted buggy-cushion filled with hen feathers. He lies, he steals, he assassinates, he mutilates, he tortures. He needs Persian powder long before he needs the theology which abler men cannot agree upon. We can, in fact, only retain him as we do the buffalo, so long as he complies with the statutes. But the red brother is on his way to join the cave-bear, the three-toed horse, and the ichthyosaurus in the great fossil realm of the historic past. Move on, maroon brother, move on!"
"Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler were nominated in the summer of 1876, and so close was the fight against Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A. Hendricks that friends of the latter to this day refer to the selection of Hayes and Wheeler by a joint Electoral Commission to whom the contested election was referred, as a fraud and larceny on the part of the Republican party. It is not the part of an historian, who is absolutely destitute of political principles, to pass judgment. Facts have crept into this history, it is true, but no one could regret it more than the author; yet there has been no bias or political prejudice shown, other than that reflected from the historical sources whence information was necessarily obtained."
"Hayes was chosen, and gave the country an unruffled, unbiased administration, devoid of frills, and absolutely free from the appearance of hostility to any one. He was one of the most conciliatory Presidents ever elected by Republican votes or counted in by a joint Electoral Commission."
"He withdrew all troops from the South, and in several Southern States things wore a Democratic air at once."
"In 1873 Congress demonetized silver, and quite a number of business-men were demonetized at the same time; so in 1878 silver was made a legal tender for all debts. As a result, in 1879 gold for the first time in seventeen years sold at par."
"carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the"
"flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window."
Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
"were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that"
"reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition.  Sure enough, he came;"
and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
"drawing-room window.  He went quickly into the hall, listened a second,"
"and opened the dining-room door.  Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale"
"and restless.  He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton,"
who said:
"""How are you?  Gyp not in?"""
"""No."""
"Something in the sound of that ""No"" touched Winton with a vague--a very"
vague--compunction.  To be left by Gyp!  Then his heart hardened again.
"The fellow was a rotter--he was sure of it, had always been sure."
"""Baby looks well,"" he said."
Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
"""Where is Gyp?  I want her to come in.  I want her."""
Winton took out his watch.
"""It's not late.""  And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he"
"was playing.  To get the baby; to make Gyp safe--yes!  But, somehow, not"
this pretence that he knew nothing about it.  He turned on his heel and
walked out.  It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it.  He could
not stay and go on prevaricating like this.  Had that woman got clear?
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
'What is it?' I asked without curiosity.
"'A little boy gave it to me at the door,' he answered. 'I was to ask"
you to be in the street opposite Herr Krapp's half an hour after
sunset this evening.'
I gasped. 'Herr Krapp's!' I exclaimed.
"Steve nodded, looking at me queerly. 'Yes; do you know him?' he said."
"'I do now,' I muttered, gulping down my amazement. But my face was as"
"red as fire, the blood drummed in my ears. I had to turn away to hide"
my emotion. 'What was the boy like?' I asked.
But it seemed that the lad had made off the moment he had done his
"errand, and Steve had not noticed him particularly. 'I called after"
"him to know who sent him,' he added, 'but he had gone too far.'"
"I nodded and mumbled something, and went on into the house. Perhaps I"
"was still a little sore on my girl's account, and resented the easy"
"way in which she had dropped out of others' lives. At any rate, my"
"instinct was to keep the thing to myself. The face at the window, and"
"then this strange assignation, could have only one meaning; but, good"
"or bad, it was for me. And I hugged myself on it, and said nothing"
even to my lady.
"The day seemed long, but at length the evening came, and when the"
"men had gone to drill and the house was quiet, I slipped out. The"
streets were full at this hour of men passing to and fro to their
"drill-stations, and of women who had been out to see the camp, and"
were returning before the gates closed. The bells of many of the
"""Give it here,"" one of the men asked. And as Si handed over the"
contraband it slipped from his hands. He caught at it quickly to save
it from the dirt of the floor. Suddenly something small and gleaming
fell from the folds and rolled upon the floor.
"""I'll be ding-blasted!"" roared Cap'n Phin. Someone swore softly. The"
man Si dropped to his knees. Sidney blinked.
Cap'n Phin seized the silk and unwound it. And among the countless
folds he found a cunningly contrived pocket filled with hundreds of the
priceless gems.
"For a moment no one spoke. The daring of it all, the wealth of the"
"glistening jewels, held each man in the room. Cap'n Phin folded the"
gorgeous silk and passed it to one of the men.
"""I guess this belongs to you in trust for Uncle Sam,"" he said gravely."
"""Our business is with one Jed Starrow."" He turned to Sidney who was"
"trembling violently. ""Now, matie, will you tell these men how you"
"happened to ship aboard the _Arabella_ last night?"""
"Sidney's story tumbled out in quick, eager words and in careful detail."
"The men listened closely. The one who had taken the diamonds ""in trust"
"for Uncle Sam"" made notes in a small black book. When she had finished"
"Cap'n Phin nodded, his face serious."
"""Reckon we'd better not question Lav Green just yet, he's pullin' out"
of the fog. We got enough as 'tis to hold Jed Starrow. If I ain't much
mistaken he'll turn yellow when we face him and squeal on the folks
higher up what's paid him to hurt the name of the Cape. That'll do for
"now, little gal."""
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
dance-contracts.
"Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his"
"black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room.  He"
"was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of"
that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the
"sunflowers, and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view"
"of his thick red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over"
"a shiny white shirt.  And, holding out her hand, she said:"
"""How do you do, Mr. Wagge?  It was kind of you to come."""
Mr. Wagge turned.  His pug face wore a downcast expression.
"""I hope I see you well, ma'am.  Pretty place you 'ave 'ere.  I'm fond of"
"flowers myself.  They've always been my 'obby."""
"""They're a great comfort in London, aren't they?"""
"""Ye-es; I should think you might grow the dahlia here.""  And having thus"
"obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire, satisfied some obscurer"
"desire to flatter, he went on: ""My girl showed me your letter.  I didn't"
like to write; in such a delicate matter I'd rather be vivey vocey.  Very
"kind, in your position; I'm sure I appreciate it.  I always try to do the"
Christian thing myself. Flesh passes; you never know when you may have to
"take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you."""
"""I'm very glad.  I hoped perhaps you would."""
"Mr. Wagge cleared his throat, and went on, in a hoarser voice:"
"""I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your"
*       *       *       *       *
"Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out."
"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"
"knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing"
"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found
"presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know"
how to bear the situation.  I can't bring myself to think of money in
"relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my"
"daughter, very serious loss.  I've got my family pride to think of.  My"
"daughter's name, well--it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm"
"respected--a regular attendant--I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure"
"you, I feel I can't control myself, and it's only that--and you, if I may"
"say so, that keeps me in check."""
"During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and"
"unclenching, and he shifted his broad, shining boots.  Gyp gazed at them,"
not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from
"Christianity to shekels, from his honour to the world, from his anger to"
herself.  And she said:
"""Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge.  I should be so unhappy if I"
"mightn't do that little something."""
Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
"""It's a delicate matter,"" he said.  ""I don't know where my duty lays.  I"
"don't, reelly."""
Gyp looked up then.
"""The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?"""
"Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from"
the thought: 'Sufferin'!  You must leave that to her father!' Then it
"wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a"
"moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed.  Gyp said"
softly:
"""A friend who knows you both.""  Then she added: ""From my information I"
hear that last season you danced so much with her and were so constantly
"at her side that people were talking of a match between you."""
"""Ridiculous!""  I exclaimed.  ""Of course gossips are always too ready to"
"jump to ill-formed conclusions.  As one of the staff of the Embassy, and"
"her most intimate male friend, it was only courtesy to take her beneath"
"my care.  When she had no other partner and wanted to dance, then she"
"sometimes asked me.  I think she did it to annoy me, for she knew that I"
"was never fond of dancing."""
"""Do you remember the Countess of Flanders' balls at Brussels--how we"
"danced together?"" she remarked."
"""Remember them!""  I echoed.  ""They were in the golden days when"
everything seemed to our eyes couleur de rose--the days when our love
"was perfect."""
"She sighed again, but no word escaped her.  She was, I knew, reflecting"
upon those blissful days and nights when we met here and there at all
"hours and at all the best houses in Brussels, dining, lunching, dancing,"
and gossiping--together always.
"""Will you not resolve to forget the past, Yolande?""  I asked fervently,"
"taking her hand in mine again.  ""Come, tell me that you will--that you"
"will not hold me aloof like this?  I cannot bear it--indeed I can't, for"
"I love you;"" and I bent until my lips touched her finger-tips."
"""I cannot!"" she cried at last, with an effort rising and firmly"
withdrawing her hand from my grasp.
pillow.
I held my breath.  The awful truth was distinctly apparent.  I placed my
"hand upon her heart, the bodice of her dress being already unloosened."
"Then a few seconds later I drew back, standing rigid and aghast."
"""Why, she's dead!""  I gasped."
"""Yes,"" the Countess said, covering her face with her hands and bursting"
"into tears.  ""My poor Yolande! she is dead--_dead_!"""
The discovery appalled me.  Only a couple of hours before we had chatted
"together, and she seemed in the best of health and spirits, just as in"
"the old days, until I had made the announcement of Wolf's presence in"
Paris.  The effect of that statement upon her had apparently been
"electrical.  Why, I knew not.  Had she not implored me to save her?"
This in itself was sufficient to show that she held him in deadly fear.
"Again I bent in order to make further examination, but saw the"
unmistakable mark of death upon her countenance.  The lower jaw had
"dropped, the checks were cold, and the silver hand-mirror which I had"
snatched from the table and held at her mouth was unclouded.  There was
"no movement--no life.  Yolande, my well-beloved of those long-past days,"
was dead.
I stood there at the bedside like a man in a dream.  So swiftly had she
been struck down that the terrible truth seemed impossible of
realisation.
"The Countess, standing beside me, sobbed bitterly.  Truly the scene in"
that darkened chamber was a strange and impressive one.  Never before in
my whole life had I been in the presence of the dead.
*CHAPTER IX.*
"*""A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS.""*"
"""Master, master, wake up!  What ails you? Have you forgot the day, and"
"what has to be done?"""
"Dick, with an expression of uneasiness and determination upon his face,"
was shaking Grey somewhat vehemently by the shoulder.  The latter seemed
"to find it hard to wake; and when his eyes opened at last, there was a"
lack-lustre expression in them that was strange and unnatural.  Dick’s
honest face clouded over yet more.
"""I was certain there was some devilry afoot when they all came here last"
"night.  I have never seen my master in such a mad mood of merriment,"" he"
"muttered half aloud, as he turned away to get a brimming glass of pure"
"cold water from the table.  ""What has come over them, I don’t know.  But"
I like not the change. I liked not the look in Lord Sandford’s eyes.  He
"is a great man, I doubt it not; but I wish my master had chanced upon"
another as a friend and comrade in this great Babylon of a city.  There
"is more going on here than I well understand."""
"""What are you grumbling over there to yourself, Dicon?"" asked Grey from"
"his bed, and his voice sounded more natural and quiet than his servant"
"had heard it yet; ""and where am I?  For sure this room is strange to"
"mine eyes, nor have I any recollection of it overnight; and how come you"
"to be here, for that matter, honest Dicon?  Methought you were at"
"Hampstead, watching over Don Carlos, that he might be ready for"
"Saturday’s race."""
with more flowers.
'Ha!' I said foolishly. 'What is it?'
"'My lady sent me to you,' she answered."
"'Yes,' I asked eagerly. 'Does she want me?'"
"But Marie hung her head, and played with the flowers. 'I don't think"
"so,' she whispered. 'She only sent me to you.'"
Then I understood. The Waldgrave had gone to the farther end. Steve
and the men were tending the horses half a dozen paces beyond the
"screen of willow-leaves. We were alone. A rat plashed into the water,"
"and drove Marie nearer to me; and she laid her head on my shoulder,"
"and I whispered in her ear, till the lashes sank down over her eyes"
"and her lips trembled. If I had loved her from the first, what was the"
"length and height and breadth of my love now, when I had seen her in"
"darkness and peril, sunshine and storm, strong when others failed,"
"brave when others flinched, always helpful, ready, tireless! And she"
"so small! So frail, I almost feared to press her to me; so pale, the"
blood that leapt to her cheeks at my touch seemed a mere reflection of
the sunlight.
I told her how Steve had made the guards at the prison drunk with wine
bought with her dowry; how the horses he had purchased and taken out
of the camp by twos and threes had been paid for from the same source;
"and how many ducats had gone for meats and messes to keep the life,"
"that still ran sluggishly, in the Waldgrave's veins. She listened and"
lay still.
"'So you have no dowry now, little one,' I said, when I had told her"
Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a piece but found it dry in
her mouth. She was thinking of her sisters and the safety of the dear
old house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before her eyes
"she saw the little circle around the dining room table, the embroidered"
"square of Indian cloth, the green shaded lamp, Issy's books and Trude's"
"sewing, Vick's sketching things, the girls at their beloved tasks--and"
"her chair empty! Oh, what if she never sat again in that dear circle?"
Her heart broke in an agony of longing for Trude.
A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show of spirit.
"""If I had known how to swim we'd all be ashore now! And you two stayed"
"with me! I--I don't believe I'm worth that, girls."" She spoke with"
gloomy conviction.
But Mart answered with a promptness that settled that question forever.
"""Forget it. Why, you don't think we could a' done anything else, do"
you? And now I'm going up on deck and get some air. We must be most to
"Halifax by this time."""
"""_Halifax!_"" But this time Pola did not scream."

His Mr. Dugald had taught him the science of swimming and because it
"was the one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of his"

"Captain Dove came forth from his cabin, indifferently clad, and eyed"
Slyne with a sarcastic interest which somewhat disconcerted that
homilist.
"""You don't _look_ just like a Band o' Hope!"" said the old man, ""but--"""
"Slyne rose again, and bit his lip, in simulated impatience. ""Oh, all"
"right,"" said he. ""If you're not interested--"""
"Captain Dove scowled at him. ""I'm interested,"" he said grudgingly. ""I'll"
"see this lawyer-fellow of yours whenever you like to bring him aboard,"
"and--if the money's there, you can count me in."""
"""He isn't the sort of lawyer you've been accustomed to, Dove,"" said"
"Slyne. ""You've got to go to him."""
"Captain Dove did his best to out-stare him, but failed."
And he went out and banged the door behind him. He walked the streets
furiously angry with Herold. He had gone to consult him on a baffling
problem. Herold had suggested a maiden aunt as a solution. He had but
"one, his mother's sister. Her name was Gladys. What was a woman of over"
fifty doing with such an idiot name? His Aunt Gladys lived at Croydon
and spent her time solving puzzles and following the newspaper accounts
of the doings of the royal family. She knew nothing. He remembered when
he was a boy at school coming home for the holidays cock-a-whoop at
having won the high jump in the school athletics sports. His Aunt
"Gladys, while professing great interest, had said, “But what I don't"
"understand, dear, is--what do you get on to jump down from?” He had"
"smiled and explained, but he had felt cold in the pit of his stomach. A"
futile lady. His opinion of her had not changed. In these days John was
rather an intolerant fellow.
"Chance willed it, however, that when he reached Fenton Square he found"
a letter which began “My dearest John” and ended “Your loving Aunt
Gladys.” And it was the letter of a very sweet-natured gentlewoman.
"John sat down at his desk to work, but ideas would not come. At last"
"he lit his pipe, threw himself into a chair in front of the fire, and"
"smoked till past midnight, with his heavy brows knitted in a tremendous"
frown.
CHAPTER VI
THE same frown darkened Risca's brow the next day as he waited for
admittance at his Aunt Gladys's door. It was such a futile little door

4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.
Two great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:
"Ambrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western"
"Church;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and"
reformer of church music.
"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but"
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a
"large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be"
"known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,"
"theologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the"
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.
"Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of"
"Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,"
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and
variety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to
"be known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”"
"because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free"
"rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant"
remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the

"""Stop! Don't you give me any more o' that Webster Unabridged. You git to"
"cases. If you didn't come here to steal you came to The Polka to rob it,"
"didn't you?"""
"Johnson, his eyes lowered, was forced to admit that such were his"
"intentions, adding swiftly:"
"""But when I knew about you--"" He broke off and took a step towards her."
"""Wait! Wait! Wait where you are! Don't you take a step further or"
"I'll--"" She made a significant gesture towards her bosom, and then,"
"laughing harshly, went on denouncingly: ""A road agent! A road agent!"
"Well, ain't it my luck! Wouldn't anybody know to look at me that a"
"gentleman wouldn't fall my way! A road agent! A road agent!"" And again"
"she laughed bitterly before going on: ""But now you can git--git, you"
"thief, you imposer on a decent woman! I ought to have tol' 'em all, but"
I wa'n't goin' to be the joke o' the world with you behind the curtains

"a road agent! But now you can git--git, do you hear me?"""
Johnson heard her to the end with bowed head; and so scathing had been
her denunciations of his actions that the fact that pride alone kept her
from breaking down completely escaped his notice. With his eyes still
downcast be said in painful fragments:
"""One word only--only a word and I'm not going to say anything in defence"
of myself. For it's all true--everything is true except that I would
won your love by a trick. I had to show you the lowest and worst part
"of myself before the best in me could grow--the best in me, which is"
"yours."""
"""You are raving!"""
"""I am not raving. You must see I am not. Look at me. I am calmer than"
"you, though I face certain death. I knew when I came here that the"
"chances were I should be killed before I even saw you, but I had to"
"risk that. I had to win your trust back somehow, honestly and fairly."
"I can not live without your trust."""
"""Beatrice!"" The name escaped him almost without his knowledge. He saw"
tears spring to her eyes.
"""It is true. Your love and your trust have become my life. Then I was"
unworthy of both. I tried to make myself worthy. I did what I could. I
told you the truth--I threw away the only thing that mattered to me. I
"could not hold your love any longer by a lie--I loved you too much!"""
"For that moment the passionate energy of her words, the sincerity and"
"eloquence of her glance, swept back every thought of suspicion. He"
"stood stupefied, almost overwhelmed. Mechanically his lips formed"
themselves to a few broken sentences.
"""You can not know what you are saying. You are beside yourself. Once,"
"in my ignorance, I believed it possible, but now I know that it could"
"never be. Your race despises mine--"""
"""I do not care what you are nor to whom you belong!"" she broke in,"
"exulting. ""You are the man who taught me to believe that there is"
"something in this world that is good, that is worthy of veneration;"
"tears was ready to accompany her tale of woe, so I said hurriedly: ""Don't"
"cry. Laugh while you speak. You will attract less attention."""
"She tried to laugh, but the effort was piteous and became a failure, as"
she said:--
"""George Hamilton has sailed for Canada, and my heart is broken."""
"Again she tried to smile, but the smile never reached her eyes, for they"
were full of tears.
"""How do you know?"" I asked, almost stunned by the news."
"She tried to stay her tears, but failed, and answered between sobs: ""Last"
"night at the queen's ball, the king showed me a letter sent by order of"
"the French king, saying that George had sailed from Bordeaux for Canada"
"nearly a fortnight ago. I could not help showing my grief, and the king,"
"who was boisterously happy, said: 'Now you will forget him and listen to"
"me.' I smiled, but it was a poor effort, and he smiled, showing his"
yellow fangs as he left me. I pray God that I may never be called upon to
"hate another man as I hate him."""
"""I can hardly believe that George has gone to Canada without notifying"
"us,"" I said."
"""Yes, I fear it is true,"" she returned. ""But if I am ever so fortunate"
"as to find him again, I intend to go with him whether he consents or no,"
regardless of father and all the world. Just as soon as I learn where he
"is in Canada, I will go to him. You will take me, won't you, Baron Ned?"""
"""I'll not give that promise,"" I answered. ""But I am sure there is"

"for a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in"
"command. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much"
mischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the
two pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got
"away, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his"
"crew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of"
"whom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were"
"English, three Dutch, two French, and one Portuguese."
"SANDERS, THOMAS."
An Elizabethan mariner who was taken prisoner by the Moors. He wrote a
narrative of his life as a slave on a Barbary pirate galley.
"""I and sixe more of my fellowes,"" he wrote, ""together with four-score"
"Italians and Spaniards, were sent foorth in a Galeot to take a Greekish"
"Carmosell, which came into Africa to steale Negroes. We were chained three"
"and three to an oare, and we rowed naked above the girdle, and the"
"Boteswaine of the Galley walked abaft the masts, and his Mate afore the"
"maste ... and when their develish choller rose, they would strike the"
Christians for no cause. And they allowed us but halfe a pound of bread a
"man in a day without any other kind of sustenance, water excepted.... We"
"were then so cruelly manackled in such sort, that we could not put our"
"hands the length of one foote asunder the one from the other, and every"

When those present had laughed and joked sufficiently over the
"Captain's proposal, the sober market gardener, Pavlyugus asked:"
"""But seriously, what are we to do, your honour? ... Eh?  What do you"
"think?"""
"""I?  I shall neither move hand nor foot.  If they wish to clean the"

"""Some of the houses are almost coming down...."""
"""Let them fall; don't interfere; and when they fall ask help from the"

"""They will say it is rain-water."""
"""Does it destroy the houses in the city?  Eh?  They take taxes from you"
but they do not permit you to speak!  They destroy your property and at
"the same time compel you to repair it!""  And half the radicals in the"
"street, convinced by the words of Kuvalda, decided to wait till the"
rain-water came down in huge streams and swept away their houses.  The
"others, more sensible, found in the teacher a man who composed for them"
an excellent and convincing report for the Corporation.  In this report
the refusal of the street's inhabitants to comply with the resolution
of the Corporation was so well explained that the Corporation actually

"""Whatever you do will make no difference to anyone in the wide world but"
"yourself,"" said Slyne. ""If you do what you're told you'll get a great"
deal more than you deserve out of it. If you don't--D'ye think I'd have
"taken you into the team if I didn't know how to drive you!"" he asked,"
"his eyes beginning to blaze. ""Why, my good fellow, if you refuse, if"
"you don't travel up to your collar, if you so much as shy at anything"
you see or hear--I won't even hurt you; I'll just hand you over to the
police.
"""So make up your mind now, quick!"""
"""You've nothing against me,"" quavered the lawyer."
"""No, I've nothing--not very much, at least, yet,"" Slyne agreed, knotting"
"his tie neatly before the glass. ""But--that may be because you haven't"
"embezzled any of my money--yet."" He had most opportunely recalled what"
the detective Dubois had told him about his new friend.
Mr. Jobling's face was almost green. He got up with an evident effort.
"""I was only joking,"" he declared with a most ghastly grin. ""I'll be"
"quite satisfied with ten per cent. of the accumulated income--in fact,"
"we'll call it a couple of hundred thousand pounds, if you like."""
"""All right,"" Slyne agreed imperturbably. ""Make it that amount if you'd"
rather. How long will it take you to get the papers drawn out? It's
"nearly one o'clock. And--you won't be safe till they're signed."""

power. At that a terrible feeling of hopelessness assailed him. His only
chance was to reach the valley where he had little fear of capture; but
"wounded, as he was, that seemed out of the question, and he saw himself"
caught like a rat in a trap. In an access of rage at the situation in
which he was placed he made another effort to raise himself up on his
elbow and peer through the window at the Sierras. The noise that he
"made, slight though it was, awoke the Girl. In an instant she was at his"
bedside drawing the curtain over the window.
"""What you thinkin' of?"" she asked. ""At any moment--jest as soon as the"
trail can be cleared--there'll be someone of the boys up here to see how
"I've pulled through. They mustn't see you . . ."""
"Forcibly, but with loving tenderness, she put him back among his pillows"
and seated herself by the bed. An awkward silence followed. For now that
the man was in his right senses it was borne in upon her that he might
"remember that she had fed him, given him drink and fondled him. It was a"
situation embarrassing to both. Neither knew just what to say or how to
"begin. At length, the voice from the bed spoke:"
"""How long have I been here?"""
"""Three days."""
"""And you have nursed me all that--"""
"""You mustn't talk,"" warned the girl. ""It's dangerous in more ways than"
"one. But if you keep still no one'll suspect that you're here."""
"""But I must know what happened,"" he insisted with increasing excitement."

contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
"represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent"
"works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,"
"Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical"
"contributions have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are"
coming into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for
"a long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others."
The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in English
and German traditions. The _Hymnary_ illustrates this trend. It makes
large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving a
"considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this trend,"
"the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist and other"
"churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German chorale tunes"
and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn books of our
time have become the channels through which flow the rich contributions
to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian people of all times
and places.

mechanically: 'A cup of hot tea!  How quaint!  What should it be but
hot?'
"The maid came back with the tea; she was an affectionate girl, full of"
"that admiring love servants and dogs always felt for Gyp, imbued, too,"
with the instinctive partisanship which stores itself one way or the
other in the hearts of those who live in houses where the atmosphere
"lacks unity.  To her mind, the mistress was much too good for him--a"

Dex Harlow was a six-foot Senior Lieutenant who had been on many an
out-of-the-way exploratory trip. Like Brand he was just under thirty
and perpetually thirsting for the bizarre in life. He was a walking
document of planetary activity. He was still baked a brick red from a
"trip to Mercury a year before: he had a scar on his forehead, the"
result of jumping forty feet one day on the moon when he'd meant to
jump only twenty; he was minus a finger which had been irreparably
frost-bitten on Mars; and he had a crumpled nose that was the outcome
of a brush with a ten-foot bandit on Venus who'd tried to kill him for
"his explosive gun and supply of glass, dyite-containing cartridges."
"He clutched Brand's fingers in a bone-mangling grip, and threw his hat"
into a far corner.
"""You're a fine friend!"" he growled cheerfully. ""Here I'm having a"
"first rate time for myself, swimming and planing along the Riviera,"
with two more weeks leave ahead of me--and I get a call from the Old
"Man to report to you. What excuse have you for your crime?"""
"""A junket to Jupiter,"" said Brand. ""Would you call that a good"
"excuse?"""
"""Jupiter!"" exclaimed Dex. ""Wouldn't you know it? Of course you'd have"
to pick a spot four hundred million miles away from all that grand
"swimming I was having!"""
"""Would you like to go back on leave, and have me choose someone else?"""
inquired Brand solemnly.
"""Well, no,"" said Dex hastily. ""Now that I'm here, I suppose I might as"
"well go through with it."""
in certain curiosities. She had seen that morning what had escaped the
Canon’s notice--the stranger’s grasp on Yvonne’s arm and the insolent
"admiration on his face. This fact, coupled with Yvonne’s agitation, had"
"put her upon the track of scandal. The result was, that at the concert"
"she made interesting discoveries, and, piecing things together in her"
"mind afterwards, bided her time to make use of them."
"It would be for the Canon’s sake, naturally. A woman of Mrs."
Winstanley’s stamp is always the most disinterested of God’s creatures.
She never performed an action of which her conscience did not approve.
But she was such a superior woman that her conscience trembled a little
"before her, like most of the other friends whom she patronised. She did"
not have to wait long. The Canon called upon her soon after his return
to invite herself and the Wilmingtons to dinner. It was his last
"evening at Ostend, and Yvonne was not feeling well enough to spend it,"
"as usual, at the Kursaal."
"“Yvonne is still poorly, Everard?” she asked, with her air of"
confidential responsibility.
"“A little. She has been gadding about somewhat too much lately, and it"
has knocked her up.”
“Has it not occurred to you that her encounter this morning may have had
something to do with it?”
"“Of course not,” replied the Canon, sharply. “It would be ridiculous.”"
"“I have reasons for not thinking so, Everard. The man was singing at the"
Kursaal this afternoon. Here is his name on the programme.” She
handed him the slip of paper. He read the name among the artistes. “M.
Bazouge.” He returned it to her.
"Mr. Dugald ran with all speed to Rockman's, the other men after him. As"
their hurrying steps echoed through the silent street heads popped out
"of windows, doors opened. Then more men, half-dressed and dressing as"
"they ran, rushed after them toward Rockman's. They knew, with that"
"intuition inbred in seacoast communities, that something was wrong. Old"
"Simon Tibbetts, too crippled to join the gathering crowds, rang up"
Commander Nelson at the Life Guard station on the backside.
"When, in the gray light of the dawn, the _Sally_ chugged up to"
"Rockman's wharf with its precious cargo Sidney and Mart found a weary,"
anxious crowd of men and women gathered there. And as Cap'n Davies and
Saunders lifted the girls ashore a lusty shout of rejoicing went
up--eager hands reached out to touch the rescued as though to make
certain they were safe and sound.
"Sidney had eyes only for Mr. Dugald who seemed to tower above them all,"
"his eyes dark lined with the strain of anxious watching, his mouth set"
"sternly. And strangely enough, at first, Dugald Allan saw only Sidney,"
"yet it was not strange, for the white-faced, shrinking, abject girl,"
"barefooted and disheveled, who was hiding behind Mart and Sidney, had"
little semblance to his gay young cousin.
Mr. Dugald opened his arms and Sidney ran into them like a little
"child, and clung to him. He felt her slender body shaking."
"""I--I can't help crying. I wanted Trude--so much!"""
"""_I_ was thinking of Trude, too. Thank God!"" But Sidney was too moved"
at the moment to wonder at his words or that the cheek he bent to hers
was wet with tears.
"alone!"""
"""Oh, yes, I can,"" she murmured. ""I always make things alone!"""
"I tried to fathom the meaning of this, but gave it up and started to go"
"on deck. If I could take her father off to one side and explain, well"
and good. He would perhaps sympathize with my mistake when he understood
that it was partially the result of a desire to fill Monsieur with
"spirits. Considering this, I spoiled everything by asking:"
"""What does he look like?"""
"""My father?"" she gasped, in a wondering way."
"""No--yes--certainly not! I mean--oh, this is intolerable! I don't know"
"your father, never saw him in my life--unless he was the one with you"
last night when you drove me frantic with that ball of paper trick! But
what you did has nothing to do with my being here. I've not wilfully
followed. A stupid boatman mistook your yacht for my own when I was--I
"mean to say, when I was too engrossed with the memory of you to notice"
"his mistake."""
"From alarm her look gave way to wonderment, then almost to mirth. It was"
"a hard place for a girl to be in, and I expected her to leave me now,"

that there are no yard-arms on schooner yachts made no difference. And I
"do believe she was considering that when a sailor passed us, looking"
enough like Tommy to have been his twin brother.

"The fellow saluted and left, and I stared at her in surprise, saying:"

"hear no more about _him_ now."""
"""You mean that it's an absolutely sure thing for her,"" Captain Dove"
"suggested, and Mr. Jobling looked pained."
"""I can't afford to risk anything on uncertainties, sir,"" he answered"
"stiffly. ""And I'll stake my professional reputation on--"""
"""Oh, never mind about all that,"" Slyne broke in, folding his share of"
"the papers together and pocketing them. ""The syndicate's safely floated."
And now--as to our next move.
"""You'd better get away back to Genoa by the five o'clock train, Dove."
And you must take Ambrizette with you; I'll get Sal--Lady Josceline
another maid in Paris--one who won't attract quite so much attention to
us as that damned dwarf would.
"""Jobling and I will go on there by the night-mail, on our way to London"
with--Lady Josceline. You can take the _Olive Branch_ round to some safe
"English port and lay her up there in the meantime. As soon as you land,"
you can rejoin us--at Jobling's address. By that time we'll probably be
"ready to redeem our note to you."""
"""By that time,"" Captain Dove returned with concentrated bitterness,"
"""you'll have found some way to give me the slip altogether. D'ye take me"
"for a blind idiot, Slyne? D'ye think I'm going to let Sallie out of my"
"sight, with you?"""
"Slyne was visibly disconcerted. ""But--aren't you going to take your ship"
"round to England?"" he asked, in genuine surprise. ""You can't very well"
official? But the very German nurses and doctors at the Red Cross
hospital had spoken of her having given free treatment in her Home
"to Germans who needed immediate operations, and for whom there was"
no room in the military hospitals--And for such a trivial offence as
_that_--and to kill her before there could be any appeal for
reconsideration or clemency. Oh _what_ a nation! She would tend
their sick and wounded no more.
She hurried on up the ascent of the Boulevard of the Botanic Garden
on her way to the Rue Royale. She burst into von Giesselin's office.
He was not there. A clerk looking at her rather closely said that
"the Herr Oberst was packing, was going away. Vivie scarcely took in"
"the meaning of his German phrases. She waited there, her eyes"
"ablaze, feeling she must tell her former friend and protector what"
she thought of his people before she renounced any further
relations with him.
"Presently he entered, his usually rather florid face pale with"
"intense sorrow or worry, his manner preoccupied. She burst out:"
"""_Have_ you seen the Red Placard they have just put up?"""
"""What about?"" he said wearily."
"""The assassination by your Government of Edith Cavell, a crime for"
"which England--yes, and America--will _never_ forgive you.... From"
"this moment I--"""
"""But have you not heard what has happened to _me_? I am _dismissed_"
"from my post as Secretary, I am ordered to rejoin my regiment in"

"had, as he saw it. And yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this"
girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and
all objects.
"“This way of living that you speak of,” she said, “sounds so futile and"
purposeless. Haven’t you any work to do in the world that might
interest you more?”
"“My dear Miss Marian,” he exclaimed—“work! Think of dressing every day"
"for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a"
policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to
"the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart’s gait."
We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.”
"The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked"
out to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now;
her limp was scarcely noticeable.
"“Thank you for a nice time,” she said, frankly. “I must run home now. I"
"liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.”"
"He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a"
"game of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather"
"rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward."
In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a
sixty-nine days’ rest. He went about it thoughtfully.
"“That was a stunning girl,” he said to himself. “She’s all right, too,"
"I’d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I’d told her"
"the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it!"
I had to play up to my clothes.”
"""Won't you sit down?"" he suggested with debonair courtesy."
But she shook her head; she was evidently afraid to receive him on any
such friendly footing. She did not even care to ask him what he was
doing in evening dress at breakfast-time and on board the _Olive
Branch_. But in her troubled eyes he could read that unspoken inquiry.
"""I've been travelling all night to get back to you, Sallie,"" he told"
"her, in a low, eager tone, ""and I hadn't time to change--I was in such a"
hurry to tell you the news. I've come to take you away from the _Olive
"Branch_,--and Captain Dove. I've come to set you free."""
"She stared at him as though she had not heard aright, her lips parted,"
"her eyebrows arched, a faint, puzzled, questioning frown on her"
forehead.
"""I've come to set you free,"" he said again."
"""At what price?"" she asked suddenly, with disconcerting directness, and"
his would-be straightforward glance wavered.
"""Don't put it that way!"" he urged. ""I ask no more than the fulfilment of"
"the promise you made me. And--listen, Sallie. I've found out who you"
really are and where your home is. I'll take you there if only you--
"""I'm not asking you to marry me right away, either, remember. All you"
must do in the meantime is to sign without question some papers that
will be required. Then I'll make everything quite safe for you and take
"you to your own home."""
The quick doubt in her eyes had given place to an expression of helpless
amazement and growing dismay. But he did not wait to hear anything she
THE UNCLEAN THING.
"A few days later, Mr. Dick Derosne was walking in the Park at noon. He"
had been down to the Club and found no one there. Everybody except
"himself was at work: the politicians were scattered all over the colony,"
conducting their election campaign. Medland himself had gone to his
"constituency: his seat was very unsafe there, and he was determined to"
"keep it if he could, although, as a precaution, he was also a candidate"
"for the North-east ward of Kirton, where his success was beyond doubt."
"His friends and his foes had followed him out of town, and the few who"
were left were busy in the capital itself. Such men as these when at the
"Club would talk of nothing but the crisis, and, after he had heard all"
"there was to hear about the Benyon affair, the crisis began to bore"
"Dick. After all, it mattered very little to him; he would be out of it"
"all in a month, and the Medlands were not, when he came to think of it,"
"people of great importance. Why, the Grangers had never heard of them!"
"Decidedly, he had had enough and to spare of the Medlands."
"Nevertheless, he was to have a little more of them, for at this instant"
"he saw Daisy Medland approaching him. Escape was impossible, and Dick"
had the grace to shrink from appearing to avoid her.
"""The deuce!"" he thought, ""this is awkward. I hope she won't--"" He raised"
his hat with elaborate politeness.
Daisy stopped and greeted him with much effusion and without any
embarrassment. Dick thought that odd.
"""I was afraid,"" she said, ""we were not going to see you again before you"
"disappeared finally with the Governor."""
"misery, the Girl's face turned pale."
"""What do you mean?"" she asked."
"Johnson coloured, hesitated, and finally with a swift glance at the"
"clock, he briefly explained:"
"""I mean it's hard to go and leave you here. The clock reminded me that"
long before this I should have been on my way. I shouldn't have come up
"here at all. God bless you, dear,"" and here their eyes came together and"
"seemed unable to part,--""I love you as I never thought I could . . ."""
But at Johnson's queer look she hastened to inquire:
"""But it ain't for long you're goin'?"""
For long! Then she had not understood that he meant to go for all time.
How tell her the truth? While he pondered over the situation there came
"to him with great suddenness the thought that, perhaps, after all, Life"
never intended that she should be given to him only to be taken away
almost as suddenly; and seized with a desire to hold on to her at any
"cost, he sprang forward as if to take her in his arms, but before he"
"reached her, he stopped short."
"""Such happiness is not for me,"" he muttered under his breath; and then"
"aloud he added: ""No, no, I've got to go now while I have the courage, I"
"mean."" He broke off as suddenly as he had begun, and taking her face in"
his hands he kissed her good-bye.
"Now, accustomed as was the Girl to the strange comings and goings of the"
"men at the camp, it did not occur to her to question him further when he"
"told her that he should have been away before now. Moreover, she trusted"
"Upon my insistence, he accepted the gold and gave me the ten guineas he"
"had borrowed from Lilly, asking me to return them."
Frances was making an entire failure of her effort to hold herself in
"check, and George was having difficulty in restraining himself, so, to"
"bring the interview to an end, he gave me his hand, saying:--"
"""Thank you, Ned, and good-by. I wish I could hope ever to see you again,"
"but if Le Grand fails me, I shall go to the new world and lose myself in"
"the Canadian woods."""
"""No, no!"" cried Frances, imploringly."
"""I hope not,"" began George, but he could not finish, so he took Frances"
"in his arms for a moment, and when he released her, thrust us both out"
"the door, saying: ""Please leave me at once. If you do not, I fear I shall"
"never let her go. Take care of her, Ned. Good-by!"""
"The door closed on us, and when Frances had put on her vizard, she"
followed me upstairs to see Betty.
"I was not admitted to Betty's room, so I went back to the printing shop"
"for a moment, and George gave me the key to the cipher, in which we were"
"to write to each other. His letters were to be sent under cover to Lilly,"
and mine were to go to an address in Paris which George would send to me.
"Long afterwards George told me of his adventures in making his escape,"
but I shall give them now in the order of their happening rather than in
the order of time in which I learned them.
"Leaving the Old Swan within ten minutes after I had said good-by to him,"
For him also there seemed no other escape. He pointed to the revolver.
"""For whom is that?"" he asked."
"""I do not know--but I will make them kill me."""
"""Why do you not shoot me, then?"" he demanded, between despair and"
"bitterness. ""That would save you all. If I fell, they would turn and"
fly. They think I am Vishnu. Haven't you thought of that? I am in your
power. Why don't you make yourself the benefactress of your country?
"Why don't you shoot her enemy?"""
"She made no answer, but her eyes met his steadily and calmly. He"
"turned away, groaning. In vain he fought against it, in vain stung"
himself to action by the memory of all that she had done to him. His
love remained triumphant. In that supreme moment his faith burst
"through the darkness, and again he believed in her, believed in her"
"against reason, against the world, against the ineffaceable past, and"
against himself. And it was too late. He no longer stood alone. His
word was given.
"""Have pity on me!"" he said, once more facing her. ""Let me save you!"""
"""I should despise myself, and you would despise me--even more than you"
do now. I can not do less than share the fate of those whose lives my
"folly has jeopardized."""
"""At least go back to them--do not stay here. Beatrice, for God's"
"sake!--I can not turn back. You have made me suffer enough--."" He"
"stood before her now as an incoherent pleader, and her heart burned"
with an exultation in which the thought of life and death played no
part. She knew that he still loved her. It seemed for the moment all
"you."" And he fell to polishing his furry, old-fashioned top-hat with a"
"tail of the scanty, ill-fitting frock-coat he had donned along with a"
noisome waistcoat in honour of the occasion.
"Slyne shrugged his shoulders, despairingly, and, having made an end of"
"his unappetising meal, prepared for the road. Then he lighted a cigar"
"very much at his leisure, while Captain Dove regarded him grimly, and"
led the way on deck without further words.
"Sallie was ready and waiting at the companion-hatch on the poop, as"
pretty as a picture in the sables Captain Dove had given her a year
before--after a very lucrative season of poaching on the Siberian coast.
"As soon as she caught sight of them she came forward, followed by"
"Ambrizette, whose appearance, in cloak and turban, was even a worse"
offence to Slyne's fastidious taste than Captain Dove's had been.
"""What a calamitous circus!"" he muttered between set teeth. ""I must get"
rid of those two somehow--and soon. But till then--
"""My car's at the back of those coal-wagons there,"" he told Captain Dove"
"with great dignity, and Captain Dove turned to the engine-room hatch."
"""Below there!"" he called down. ""Is that Mr. Brasse? I'm off now, Brasse."
"You'll carry out all my instructions, eh? And--don't quarrel with Da"
"Costa, d'ye hear?"""
"""Ay, ay, sir,"" answered a dreary voice from the depths below, and"
"Captain Dove faced about again to find Sallie, flushed and anxious,"
waiting with Ambrizette at the gangway.
"""Come on,"" he ordered irascibly, and Sallie followed him down the"
"plank. Ambrizette shuffled fearfully after her, and Slyne came last, his"
"“I see what you mean,” said he."
"“I should hope so,” said Herold."
"He looked at his watch and jumped to his feet. “Star of the Sea,” said"
"he, “to talk with you is the most fascinating occupation on earth; but"
"managers are desperate fellows, and I 'll get into boiling water if I"
miss my rehearsal.” He turned to John. “I don't see how you are going to
catch this train.”
"“Neither do I,” said John. “I shall go by the one after.”"
"Herold took his leave, promising to run down for the week-end. Constable"
"accompanied him to the door in a dignified way, and this ceremony of"
"politeness accomplished, stalked back to the hearth-rug, where he threw"
"himself down, his head on his paws, and his faithful eyes fixed on his"
mistress. John sat down again by the bedside. There was a short silence
during which Stellamaris smiled at him and he smiled at Stellamaris.
“Does n't the Great High Belovedest want to smoke?”
"“Badly,” said John."
She held out her hand for the pipe and tobacco-pouch. He gave them to
"her, and she filled the pipe. For a while he smoked peacefully. From"
where he sat all he could see of the outside world was the waste of
sun-kissed waters stretching away and melting into a band of pearly
cloud on the horizon. He might have been out at sea. Possibly this time
"next week he would be, and the salt air would be playing, as now, about"
his head. But on board that ship would be no spacious sea-chamber like
"this, so gracious in its appointments--its old oak and silver, its"
"bright chintzes, its quiet old engravings, its dainty dressing-table"
and talking together. They were greatly agitated.
The old woman sniffed and wiped her eyes. The elder daughter was
"packing a few things in a bundle. One of the officers asked: ""What about"
"our coffee?"" but she took no notice. Her sister had gone out in search"
of further information.
"She soon returned. Yes, they would all have to leave at once, but, if"
"they liked to take the risk, they could come back to-morrow with a"
"wagon, if they could get one, and fetch their belongings."
They were comforted. They knew where they would be able to get a wagon.
They would cart their stock and their household property away on the
morrow. They would start another estaminet somewhere. They would suffer
"loss and inconvenience, but they would not be ruined--their valuable"
stock of wines would save them from that.
The bundle was made up and they prepared to leave. We paid our bill and
went out into the street. Numbers of soldiers were straggling past. They
looked wretched and exhausted. Their boots and puttees were caked with
mud. They had neither rifles nor packs. Three men were lying up against
"a garden wall. We asked them for news. They could not tell us much,"
except that the Germans were still advancing.
"""We was at Dickebusch when 'e started slingin' stuff over--gorblimy, 'e"
don't 'alf wallop yer--umpteen of our mates got bleed'n' well biffed. We
"cleared out afore it got too 'ot."""
"Several famished ""battle-stragglers"" had entered our camp in order to"
beg for food. They sat round the cook-house and ate in gloomy silence.
In the adjoining field a number of tents had sprung up. Blue figures
"Rollo was about to speak, but the Sergeant whispered that the old lady"
"was now in such good case to admit them, that she might be frighted by"
his foreign accent.
In a few moments the woman could be heard stiffly and grumblingly
"descending the stairs, the door was opened, and Rebeca appeared with the"
key in her hand.
"""How many are there of your party?"" she asked, her poor hand shaking so"
"that she could scarcely fit the key in the lock, and her voice sunk to a"
quavering whisper.
"""There are five men of us and two women,"" said the Sergeant, quickly."
"""Now we are all within, pray give me the key and show us the road to the"
"Queen's apartments."""
"""Two women!"" grumbled the poor old creature, whose mind appeared to be"
"somewhat unhinged; ""that will never suit her Royal Highness the Regent,"
"especially if they are young and well-looking. She loves not such, any"
"more than I love the hussy of the pork-shop. Though, indeed, my man hath"
"not the roving eye in his head as her Señor Muñoz hath. Ah, the saints"
have mercy on all poor deserted women! But what am I saying? If the
"Lady Cristina heard me speak ill of him, she would set my poor old neck"
"in the garrote. Then--crack--all would be over!"""
"The party now advanced towards the palace, which in the gloom of a"
"starless night was still entirely hidden from their sight, save as a"
darker mass set square against the black vault of heaven.
By this time Concha and La Giralda had taken the trembling portress by
"the arms, and were bringing her along in the van, whispering comfort in"
"The Girl felt the colour leave her cheeks, though she made a gesture for"
him to proceed.
"""Pedro not 'ere any longer,"" smiled the Mexican. ""Me senda 'im to the"
"devil. Serva 'im right."""
"""An' the woman?"" gasped the Girl."
"""She gone--got away--Monterey by this time,"" replied Castro with evident"
"disappointment. ""But Meester Ashby 'e know too much--'ees men everywhere"
"searched the camp--no safa 'ere now. To-norrow--"" Castro stopped short;"
the next instant with a joyful gleam in his eyes he cried out:
"""_Maestro_!"""
"""Castro's right, Girl,"" said Johnson, who had waked and heard the"
"Mexican's last words; ""it is not safe a moment more here, and I must"
"go."""
With a little cry of loving protest the Girl abruptly left the men to
"talk over the situation and sought the opposite side of the room. There,"
her eyes half-closed and her lips pressed tightly together she gave
herself up to her distressing fears. After a while it was made plain to
"her that she was being brought into the conversation, for every now and"
"then Castro would look curiously at her; at length, as if it had been"
"determined by them that nothing should be undertaken without her advice,"
"Johnson, followed by his subordinate, came over to her and related in"
detail all the startling information that Castro had brought.
"Quietly the Girl listened and, in the end, it was agreed between them"
"that it would be safer for the men not to leave the cabin together, but"
that Castro should go at once with the understanding that he should
procure horses and wait for the master at a given point across the
A MISTAKEN IDEA
'Yet Australia has been talking freely enough about the Japanese
menace.'
'I know. It is quite a mistaken idea of the Australians that if Japan
triumphs in the present war she would be a menace to Australia. They say
that if we win we shall be masters of the East and the paramount power
"in Eastern waters. What, they ask, is to become of Australia, if we take"
it into our heads to make a descent upon their shores?'
"Baron Suyematsu again laughed boisterously, as one who can afford to"
make merry at an extravagant idea.
"'The whole thing is so utterly preposterous,' he went on, 'that it"
would not be worth considering were it not typical of what is being said
all over Europe. Our fight for national existence against Russia has
been misconstrued everywhere. We seem to have filled the Western world
"with all sorts of vague fears, France is saying that we shall soon"
deprive her of Indo-China. Germany declares we have designs on
Kiao-chau. The Dutch say that Java is no longer safe from our
"machinations. Never was such nonsense talked of a country which, after"
"all, is but fighting to preserve its national existence.'"
'And you say Japan has no intention of arming the Asiatics against the
Europeans?'
'The whole idea is absurd. Japan wishes to become one with the European
nations. I might even say she aspires to become a member of the European
family. It is a mistake to think that Japan is going to form a
Pan-Asiatic Association. Japan is the only country in the East that can
rise on European lines. Her example could not be followed by other
Thereupon his neighbour tried to create an impression by appearing calm
"and philosophical. He said in a strained, breaking voice:"
"""Think of all the waste in life and treasure this frightful war"
involves. Think of the moral degradation. Think of the widows and
"orphans. Think of the...."" He was unequal to the effort and his voice"
trailed away and then seemed to catch in his throat. But he recovered
"and with a kind of gasp he squeezed out a few more words: ""Bill, forgive"
"me for insulting you to-day--I didn't mean it, Bill. Forget it, Bill,"
"forget it! If you get killed without forgiving me, my conscience will"
"always torture...."""
"""For Christ's sake shut up, yer bleed'n' 'ypocrite,"" interrupted the"
"gruff voice of ""Bill"" somewhere out of the darkness. ""Yer always"
bleed'n' well preachin'--it's bad enough 'avin' Fritz over us without
"you bloody well rubbin' it in. If yer don't shut yer mouth, I'll come"
"over an' shut it for yer, 'struth I will."""
"The philosopher said no more, but another voice made itself heard, that"
"of a good-natured, elderly bachelor, who said with melancholy"
resignation:
"""It's jolly hard, all the same, to be knocked out like this. You're so"
"helpless--no dug-outs, no shelters anywhere...."""
"""It's doubly hard when you're married,"" said another. ""I haven't got the"
"wind up about myself at all, but I can't help thinking about my wife...."
"They're going away now, thank the Lord. You never know when they won't"
"be coming back though--that's just the worst of it."""
The noise of the propellers was indeed dying away.
"heat of the water, the pungent smell of the mustard, and that droning hum"
slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling.  She looked at
"her body, silver-white in the yellowish water, with a dreamy sensation."
"Some day she, too, would love! Strange feeling she had never had before!"
"Strange, indeed, that it should come at such a moment, breaking through"
the old instinctive shrinking.  Yes; some day love would come to her.
"There floated before her brain the adoring look on Daphne Wing's face,"
"the shiver that had passed along her arm, and pitifulness crept into her"
"heart--a half-bitter, half-admiring pitifulness.  Why should she"
"grudge--she who did not love?  The sounds, like the humming of large"
"flies, grew deeper, more vibrating.  It was the cook, in her passion"
"swelling out her music on the phrase,"
"""Be it ne-e-ver so humble,"
"There's no-o place like home!"""

"That night, Gyp slept peacefully, as though nothing had happened, as"
though there were no future at all before her.  She woke into misery.
"Her pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered,"
would force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life.  But
the struggle between mother-instinct and revolt was still going on within
"her.  She was really afraid to see her baby, and she sent word to Betty"
that she thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the
afternoon.
She got up at noon and stole downstairs.  She had not realized how
violent was her struggle over HIS child till she was passing the door of
"""That boy--there!"" she gasped, ""he frightens me--oh hateful! make him go"
"away!"" And she clutched the young man's arm with such a quick nervous"
"grasp, that a crimson flush rose quickly to Rollo's cheek."
"""No,"" muttered Etienne to himself as he watched the performance"
"critically, ""she was never in love with you, sir! She never did as much"
"for you as that. But on the whole, with a temper like Mistress Concha's,"
"I think you are well out of it, Monsieur Etienne!"" Which wise dictum"
might or might not be based on the fox's opinion as to sour grapes.
All unconsciously Rollo reached a protecting hand across to the little
white fingers which gripped his arm so tightly.
"""Go away, boy,"" he commanded; ""do you not see that you terrify the"
"Señorita?"""
"""I see--that is why I stay!"" cried the amiable youth gleefully,"
flourishing his crutch about his head as if on the point of launching it
at the party.
Rollo laid his hand on the hilt of Killiecrankie with a threatening
gesture.
"""If you come an inch nearer, I will give you plague!"" cried the boy,"
"showing his teeth wickedly, ""and your wench also. You will grow"
"black--yes, and swell! Then you will die, both of you. And there will be"
"no one to bury you, like those in the houses back there. Then all you"
"possess shall be mine, ha, ha!"""
And he laughed and danced till a fit of coughing came upon him so that
he actually crowed in a kind of fiendish exaltation. But Rollo Blair was
"not a man to be jested with, either by devil or devil's imp. He drew a"
"consolation we can find lies in the fact that we know it."""
"""Most fools lack that flattering unction,"" returned Frances, musingly."
"""Perhaps you will take more interest in this matter when I tell you"
"that it is not Betty I propose to see,"" I answered. ""I am deliberately"
"offering to take you to see some one else who is about to leave England."""
"She stood on tiptoe and kissed my lips for answer, then sank into a"
"chair, covering her face with her hands to hide the sudden tears."
I went to the window and waited till she was calm. I longed to comfort
her by telling of the faint prospect of good fortune that lay in Le
"Grand's letter, but I hesitated raising a hope which might never be"
realized.
"At the end of five minutes I went to her and said: ""Let me ask the"
"duchess to excuse you for to-night, and in the morning I'll meet you on"
"Bowling Green stairs, at, say, seven o'clock."""
"""I'll be there,"" she answered, smiling through her tears."
"The next morning we took boat, and the tide running out, made good speed"
"to the Bridge, hastened to the Old Swan, and found George in his printing"
"shop awaiting us. I remained in the old tapestried room, leaving Frances"
and George to say their farewells. In the course of a few minutes he
"called me in. He had donned his Quaker disguise, and on the floor near"
"him was a small bundle of linen. Frances was weeping, and George's voice"
was choked with emotion.
"""Well, at last, Baron Ned, you are to be rid of me,"" he said, glancing"
toward the bundle at his feet.
"everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if"
"Michael Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust."
"On the other hand, keeping the details of the operation under wraps as"
long as possible was probably wise. It minimized the chance for some
inadvertent slip-up.
"Yes, it was definitely best. Because he was staring across his desk at"
"four of Tanzan Mino's Tokyo _kobun_, all dressed in shiny black leather"
"jackets. They'd arrived at the Docklands office just after dawn,"
announcing they were there to hand-deliver the money to Tokyo. Jiro
Sato had directed them to Westminster Union.
"The four all carried black briefcases, which did not contain business"
papers. They intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means
"necessary. Jiro Sato, the London _oyabun_, had not been invited to send"
his people along with them this morning. He was now humiliated and dis-
"graced, officially removed from the operation, on Tokyo's orders. The"
"regional office had failed, so Tokyo had sent in a _Mino-gumi_ version"
of the Delta Force. They clearly had orders concerning what to do with
Michael Vance.
"He didn't like this new twist. For everything to go according to plan,"
violence had to be kept out of it. There was no way he and Michael
could go head to head with street enforcers. If Michael was thinking of
"doing that, the man was crazy."
"He glanced at his gold Omega, noting that it read ten- nineteen. In"
eleven more minutes he'd know how Michael intended to run the scenario.
"But whatever happened, he wasn't going to be intimidated by these"
"_kobun_ hoods, dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding. Those"
"myself who have no fixed residence, Sallie; and no powerful friends to"
whom to appeal against such infernal injustice. I can't tell you how
"thankful I'll be, on your account as well as my own, when we're married"
"and safely settled down, with a home of our own to feel safe in!"
"""Look, there's where we'll live when we're in London."""
Sallie looked out. They were whirling past one of the most imposing
"houses in Grosvenor Square. ""Is it an hotel?"" she asked, and observed"
that all but one or two of its topmost windows were dark.
"""It's the Earl of Jura's town house,"" said Slyne, apparently somewhat"
"piqued by her seeming indifference. ""It's yours now--or will be as soon"
"as the Chancery Court wakes up again."""
Sallie glanced back and caught another glimpse of it as the taxicab
slowed again to take the corner of the square. Slyne had picked up the
speaking-tube.
"""Get us to the station now, as fast as you can,"" he told the driver: and"
"then, having glanced at his watch, lighted a cigarette. He seemed to"
"have no more to say at the moment, and Sallie was busy with thoughts of"
her own. She was wondering whether Justin Carthew could be living in
that great house. She could not understand.... But she did not dare to
"ask Jasper Slyne for any information, since he had shown her more than"
once already that he did not intend to tell her any more than he thought
fit.
When they finally reached the station they found Mr. Jobling awaiting
them there and very anxious over their late arrival.
"""We drove round by Grosvenor Square,"" Slyne told the lawyer"
"""Hope to goodness you are,"" declared his lordship. ""Stay for a week or"
"two, anyhow: and,""--he lowered his voice to a husky whisper, leaning"
"toward her--""let _me_ trot you about a bit, eh? You'll maybe see more"
"than enough of _him_ by and by!"" He indicated Slyne with an eloquent"
"elbow, and further expressed his sentiments by means of an ardent sigh."
"Beyond the blossom-laden épergne, Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, almost"
"cut off from other intercourse by that barrier, were exchanging coldly"
"critical glances. Neither seemed to be quite at his ease with the other,"
"and both had, of course, a great many urgent questions to put to Slyne"
as soon as the Marquis of Ingoldsby should be gone. So that the
"luncheon-party must have proved a very dull affair to them, and they"
were no doubt glad when it was over.
"Slyne signalled to Sallie as soon as coffee was served, and she rose to"
leave the room. She was quite accustomed to being promptly dispensed
with whenever her company might have been inconvenient.
"""Oh, I say!"" protested Lord Ingoldsby. ""You're not goin' yet, Lady J."
Half a mo'. Won't you come for a spin with me now that the car's mine?
Just say the word and I'll drop my other engagement. And then we could
"dine at--"""
"""Lady Josceline will be engaged with her lawyer all afternoon,"" Slyne"
"cut him short with the utmost coolness, ""and she's leaving Monte Carlo"
"again to-night."""
The Marquis of Ingoldsby glowered at him.
"""I'll see you in Paris, then, Lady J.,"" he went on, pointedly ignoring"
"Slyne, ""or in London, at least, later on. Well, good-bye--if you must be"
"""We have one last chance here to deal with this problem. Tomorrow the"
"_oyabun's_ people arrive, and then they will be in control. The"
decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
"situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But"
"if you will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you"
"refuse to cooperate, the _oyabun _will destroy you as well as Vance. We"
"both know that. I am offering you a way out."""
"""With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is too late, Sato-sama,"
"which I am sure you realize,"" Nogami said, drawing on his cigar and"
"taking care not to disturb the ash. ""So with due respect I must inquire"
"concerning the purpose of this meeting."""
"""I need to locate this man Vance. Before the _kobun _from Tokyo arrive."
"If you care about his well-being, then you should remember that his"
"treatment at my hands will be more understanding than--"""
"""When do they arrive?"""
"""As I said, we received word that they will be here tomorrow, Nogami-"
"san. With respect, you have befriended a man who is attempting to"
"blackmail the Tokyo _oyabun_. That is a career decision which, I assure"
"you, is most unwise."""
"""It is made. And I am aware of the consequences. So it would appear we"
"both know all there is to know about the future."""
"""Perhaps not entirely. Someone has attempted to make us think Vance and"
"the woman were kidnapped, that they are being held somewhere beyond our"
"reach. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. But if the transaction"
"for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow, then he must appear"
"The door opened suddenly, the draught blowing down a fan and a"
"photograph-frame, and Miss Lindon entered."
"“My dear John, how good of you to come and see me!”"
"She was a fat, dumpy woman of fifty, lymphatic and, at first sight,"
"characterless. She lacked colour. Her eyes were light, but neither blue"
nor green nor hazel; her straight hair was of the nondescript hue of
"light-brown hair turning gray. Her face was fleshy and sallow, marked by"
"singularly few lines. She had lived a contented life, unscarred by care"
and unruffled by desire. Her dreams of the possibilities of existence
did not pierce beyond the gimcrackeries of Tregarthion Villas. As
"for the doings of the great world,--wars, politics, art, social"
"upheavals,--she bestowed on them, when they were obtruded on her notice,"
the same polite and unintelligent interest as she had bestowed on her
nephew's athletic feats in the days gone by.
"However, she smiled very amiably at John, and reached up to kiss him"
"on both cheeks, her flabby, white hands lightly resting on each"
"coat-sleeve. Having done this, she caught up the barking dog, who"
continued to growl from the soft shelter of arm and bosom with the
vindictiveness of pampered old age.
"“Naughty Dandy! I hope you were n't frightened at him, John. He never"
really does bite.”
“What does he do then? Sting?” John asked with gruff sarcasm.
"“Oh, no,” said Miss Lindon, round-eyed; “he 's quite harmless, I assure"
you. Don't you remember Dandy? But it's a long time since you 've been
"to see me, John. It must be three or four years. What have you been"
doing all this time?”
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered at random and since he seemed to expect"
"some reply to that fatuity. She had met a good many men in her time, but"
never one quite like this Lord Ingoldsby--who actually seemed anxious to
look and act like a cunning fool.
A waiter intervened between them. But his lordship waved that
functionary away.
"""Do let's,"" he implored with child-like insistence. ""It would be so"
"deevy to be pals with you. And I'm beastly dull here, all by myself,"
don't y'know. So--
"""Eh?"" He glared at Slyne, who had bluntly interrupted his _tête-à-tête_."
"""No, I _don't_ want any oysters--I told that waiter-chap so. And I"
_don't_ know any 'lady of the camellias.' I can't imagine what you're
"talkin' about at all, I'm sure."""
"""I saw her again last night, at the Casino,"" said Slyne, imperturbably,"
and went on to entertain Sallie with a long if not over-truthful account
"of his own over-night's doings there. So that, for all his lordship's"
"lack of manners, it was some time before that spoiled youth again"
succeeded in monopolising her attention. At every turn Slyne was ready
"to balk him, and, but for his native self-conceit coupled with a certain"
"blind obstinacy, he must very soon have understood what was perfectly"
"plain to Sallie, that he was there merely on sufferance, to serve some"
purpose of Slyne's.
"""Goin' to be here long, Lady Josephine?"" he managed to break in at last."
Slyne had turned to give a departing waiter some order.
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered again, since she could say nothing else."
"captors waiting. With their shoulders bunched for abrupt action, and"
"their guns in hand, the two men walked to the trap-door of the ship."
"They threw the heavy bolts, drew a deep breath--and flung open the"
door to charge unexpectedly toward the thickest mass of creatures that
surrounded the ship!
*       *       *       *       *
In a measure their charge was successful. Its very suddenness caught
some of the tall monstrosities off guard. Half a dozen of them stopped
the fragile glass bullets to writhe in horrible death on the red metal
paving of the square. But that didn't last long.
"In less than a minute, thin, clammy arms were winding around the"
"Earthmen's wrists, and their guns were wrenched from them. And then"
started a hand-to-hand encounter that was all the more hideous for
being so unlike any fighting that might have occurred on Earth.
"With a furious growl Dex charged the nearest creature, whose huge"
round head swayed on its stalk of a body fully six feet above his own
"head. He gathered the long thin legs in a football grip, and sent the"
thing crashing full length on its back. The great head thumped
"resoundingly against the metal paving, and the creature lay"
motionless.
"For an instant Dex could only stare at the thing. It had been so easy,"
"like overcoming a child. But even as that thought crossed his mind,"
two of the tall thin figures closed in behind him. Four pairs of arms
"wound around him, feebly but tenaciously, like wet seaweed."
"They began to constrict and wind tighter around him. He tore at them,"
dislodged all but two. His sturdy Earth leg went back to sweep the
"years. What then would be said if I----"""
"""Nay, then,"" cried Maria Cristina, ""stay where you are, Susana. For me,"
"I am none so nice. I will go myself. Do not follow me, Fernando!"" And"
"with that she ran to the door, and her feet were heard flitting up the"
stairway which led to the servants' wing of the palace. Muñoz made as if
"to accompany her, but remembering his wife's prohibition, he did not"
"proceed farther than the door, where, with a curious smile upon his"
"face, he stood listening to the voice of the Queen-Regent upraised in"
alternate appeal and rebuke.
"During the interval, while the Sergeant and El Sarria were looking to"
"their stores and munitions, Rollo approached the waiting-maid, Susana,"
"and inquired of her the way to the armoury, where he expected to find"
store of arms and powder.
"""If this young maid will go also, I will conduct you thither, young"
"man!"" said Susana, primly."
"And holding Concha firmly by the hand, she took up a candle and led the"
way.
But to Rollo's surprise they found the armoury wholly sacked. All the
valuable guns had been removed by the deserting guards. The gun racks
were torn down. The floor of beaten earth was strewed with flints of
ancient pieces of last century's manufacture. The barrels of
"bell-mouthed blunderbusses leaned against the wall, the stocks, knocked"
"off in mere wantonness, were piled in corners; and in all the chests and"
wall-presses there was not an ounce of powder to be found.
"While Rollo was searching, Señor Muñoz appeared at the door, languid and"
careless as ever. He watched the young Scot opening chests and rummaging
"Jay T. Stocking, 1870-1936, “O Master Workman” (93)"
"Wm. M. Vories, 1880—, “Let there be light, Lord God” (353)"
"Harry Webb Farrington, 1880-1931, “I know not how that” (99)"
"W. Russel Bowie, 1882—, “Lord, through changing days” (402)"
"Howard Arnold Walter, 1884-1918, “I would be true” (207)"
"Earl Marlatt, 1892—, “‘Are ye able,’ said the Master” (392)"
11. Gospel Songs.
"During the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in"
"the United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the"
"Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,"
these songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer
meetings and revivals.
The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s
salvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are
rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are
"largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The"
masses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced
a thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid
hymns failed to effect.
The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter
half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass
"meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,"
"1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and"
the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the
world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and
"every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this"
"""So it is, after all, a bargain that you offer me!"" he said. ""You are"
"trying to save them. You offer a high price, but I am not a merchant."
"I can not buy you, Beatrice."""
"""It is not a bargain!"" For the first time she faltered, taken aback by"
"the pitiless logic of his words. ""Can't you see that? Can't you see"
"that, however much I loved you, I could not act otherwise than implore"
you to turn back from a step that means destruction for those bound to
"me by blood and country? Could I do less?"""
"""No,"" he said slowly."
She held out her hands to him.
"""Oh, Nehal, turn back while there is yet time! For my sake, for yours,"
"for us all, turn back from a bloody, cruel revenge. The power is"
"yours. Be generous. If we have wronged you, we have suffered and are"
"ready to atone. _I_ am ready to atone. I _can_ atone, because I love"
you. I have spoken the truth to you. I have laid my soul bare to you
"as I have done to no other being. Won't you trust me?"""
"His eyes met hers with a somber, hopeless significance which cut her"
to the heart.
"""I can't,"" he said. ""I can't. That is what you have taught me--to"
"distrust you--and every one."""
"She stood silent now, paralyzed by the finality of his words and"
gesture. It was as though the shadow of her heartless folly had risen
"before her and become an iron wall of unrelenting, measured"
retribution against which she beat herself in vain. He lifted his head
"higher, seeming to gather together his shaken powers of self-control."
"The police launch sheered off, and the sound of her exhaust grew"
rapidly fainter and fainter. But not until it had wholly ceased did Big
George give over his post at the wheel. Even then he went down the
"ladder reluctantly, and without a word of thanks, of explanation, or of"
apology. With him this had been but a part of the day's work. He saw
neither sentiment nor humor in the episode. The clang of the
"deep-throated ship's bell spoke the hour, and, taking Cherry's arm,"
Boyd helped her to the deck.
"""Now let's eat something,"" said she."
"""Yes,"" he agreed, relief and triumph in his tone, ""and drink something,"
"too."""
"""We'll drink to the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser."""
"""To the health of 'Fingerless' Fraser,"" he echoed. ""We will drink that"
"standing."""
"A week later, after an uneventful voyage across a sea of glass, _The"
Bedford Castle_ made up through a swirling tide-rip and into the
"fog-bound harbor of Unalaska. The soaring ""goonies"" that had followed"
them from Flattery had dropped astern at first sight of the volcanic
"headlands, and now countless thousands of sea-parrots fled from the"
"ship's path, squattering away in comic terror, dragging their fat"
bodies across the sea as a boy skips a flat rock. It had been Captain
"Peasley's hope, here at the gateway of the Misty Sea, to learn"
"something about the lay of the big ice-floes to the northward, but he"
"was disappointed, for the season was yet too young for the"
"revenue-cutters, and the local hunters knew nothing. Forced to rely on"
"luck and his own skill, he steamed out again the next day, this time"
into the swifter current of the stream.
"“Jack wants to know can you spare him a few minutes, sir,” he explained."
“There’s a bit of trouble down below.”
"“What kind of trouble?” Bob asked swiftly, turning downstream without an"
instant’s delay; and walking by the side of the dynamite man.
"Calker scratched his head slowly. “I ain’t quite certain sure, Mr."
"Bainbridge,” he drawled, “but I got a idea there’s a fellow with a mill"
who’s run out a sortin’ boom that’s goin’ to hang up our drive if we
ain’t mighty keerful.”
"“A mill!” exclaimed Bob incredulously. “Why, there isn’t such a thing"
"within twenty miles--at least, there wasn’t three months ago.”"
Calker grinned. “Thought it looked kinda new. I couldn’t rightly say
"that it’s finished, but there ain’t no manner of a doubt about the boom."
"The jam had started before I come away, an’ I left Jack havin’ it hot"
an’ heavy with a red-headed son of a gun who sure looked as if scrap was
his middle name.”
"Bainbridge frowned, but asked no further questions. He scarcely spoke,"
"in fact, during all of the four miles, but it was evident to his"
observing companion that he was doing a lot of thinking.
Long before reaching the point of obstruction it became evident that
"another jam had formed. The current grew more and more sluggish, and the"
"progress of the logs downstream became slower and slower, until at"
length the entire surface of the water was covered with floating timber.
These in turn crowded upon one another with a rapidity which threatened
to equal that first jam unless something was swiftly done.
In practical agriculture my father was among Indians one of the first to
"start a tea industry in Assam, now regarded as one of the most"
flourishing. He gave practically everything in the starting of some
Weaving Mills. He stood by this and many other efforts in industrial
developments. The success of which I spoke did not come till long
after--too late for him to see it. He had come before the country was
"ready, and it happened to him as it must happen to all pioneers. Every"
one of his efforts failed and the crash came. And a great burden fell on
us which was only lifted by our united effects just before his work here
was over.
A failure? Yes but not ignoble or altogether futile. Since it was
through the witnessing of this struggle that the son learned to look on
"success or failure as one, to realise that some defeat was greater than"
"victory. And if my life in any way proved to be fruitful, then that came"
through the realisation of this lesson.
To me his life had been one of blessing and daily thanksgiving.
Nevertheless every one had said that he wrecked his life which was meant
for far greater things. Few realise that out of the skeletons of myriad
lives have been built vast continents. And it is on the wreck of a life
like his and of many such lives there will be built the Greater India
"yet to be. We do not know why it should be so, but we do know that the"
Earth Mother is hungry for sacrifice.
QUEST OF TRUTH AND DUTY
"Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose delivered the following Address, on the 25th"
sleep. Good-night.”
"“Good-night,” she said miserably."
"And so, without touch of hand, they parted."
"The hours of the evening wore on, and night came. At last she cried"
herself to sleep. It had been a day of tears.
They left Ostend quietly the following morning by the Dover boat. During
the whole journey the Canon treated Yvonne with the deferential courtesy
"he could always assume to women, seeing to her comforts, anticipating"
"her wants, even exchanging now and then casual remarks on passing"
objects of interest. But of the subject next his heart he said not a
word. The crossing was smooth. The sea air revived Yvonne’s strength.
"His silence half comforted, half frightened her. Had he relented? She"
"glanced often at his impassive face, in cruel anxiety to pierce to the"
thoughts that lay behind. Yet a little hope came to her; for fear of
losing it she dared not speak. To her simple mind it seemed impossible
that merely conscientious scruples could make him cast her off. If he
"loved her, his love would triumph. If he persisted in his resolve, he"
cared for her no longer. In this case her future was very simple. She
would go back to London and sing.
She seemed to have cried her feeling away during the night--such as he
had left unbruised and untorn. For the quivering flesh is only sensitive
up to a certain point of maceration. He had trodden upon her pitilessly;
"but she felt no resentment. In fact, she would have been quite happy if"
"he had put his arms round her and said, “Let us forget, Yvonne.” By the"
end of the journey she had cajoled herself into the idea that he would
do so.
Before long the novelty of the Tore Peak resort wore off again. The
"newspapermen wrote and sent telegrams about other gratifying misfortunes,"
the death on the Blue Peak having lost its news value. It had been an
intoxication; now came the morning after.
The Danish mountaineer quite simply deserted. He strapped on his knapsack
"and walked across the field like one of the villagers, caring no more for"
the Blue Peak. The commotion he had witnessed in the last week had taught
him a lesson.
And the tourists swarmed on to other places.
"""What harm have I done them,"" Paul probably"
"thought, ""that they should be going again? Have I been"
too much in the fields and too little with them? But I
greeted them humbly and took my man out of the
"harvesting work to help them...."""
"Then two young men arrived, sprouts off the Norwegian tree, sportsmen to"
"their finger tips, who talked of nothing but sailing, cycling, and"
"football; they were going to be civil engineers--the young Norway. They,"
"too, wanted to see the Blue Peak to the best of their ability; after all,"
one must keep pace with modern life. But they were so young that when they
"looked up at the peak, they were afraid. Solem had learned more than one"
"trick in tourist company; craftily he led them on, and then extorted money"
from them in return for a promise not to expose their foolishness. So all
"was well; the young sprouts came down the mountain again, bragging and"
showing off their sportsmanship. One of them brought down a bloodstained
"rag which he flung on the ground, saying,"
"""There's what's left of your lawyer that fell off."""
"with an inefficient chauffeur, so naturally wanted to secure the best"
man that could be got.
"I must here explain that I possessed an English chauffeur, Allan"
"by name, and that General Kitson employed his brother in the same"
"capacity. Now, without any disparagement of _my_ Allan, I knew his"
brother to be a more practical and experienced man. General Kitson
generously gave his consent to an exchange of chauffeurs.
"I may as well say, at once, that it was a lucky day for me that saw"
"Allan of the 9th Middlesex Regiment enter my service, for, during"
"the months to come, he was as cheery and full of resource as he was"
"ready for any event, however untoward. His appetite stood forth as"
"the only thing that ever caused me uneasiness, and I must admit that"
I have never met a man with one of such colossal proportion. As an
"instance--on one occasion, when camped out in the desert, between"
"Nushki and Robat, and supplies were none too plentiful, we cooked"
twelve sausages for breakfast.
"I had one, and then was persuaded by Allan to attempt a second. I"
only succeeded in disposing of half of it. I then got up and left
"Allan to have his own breakfast. Allah-dad, being a Mahommedan, of"
course refused to touch sausage.
"At lunch-time Allah-dad asked what I would have to eat, and got the"
"answer, ""Oh, some of the cold sausages left from breakfast."""
"Allah-dad replied, ""But there are no sausages, Sahib. Allan has eaten"
"them all."""
"I expostulated, maintaining that it was impossible. No normal man"
could have eaten ten and a half large sausages. But Allah-dad was
doing as she asked.
"But because his heart was not of iron, and there are few men that can"
"resist when a woman comes and woos them, he at last gave way; and they"
"fled away one night, the girl and the slave, taking with them her jewels"
"and some money. They travelled rapidly and in great fear, and did not"
"rest till they came to a city far away where the merchant would never,"
"they thought, think of searching for them."
"Here, in this city where no one knew of their history, they lived in"
"great happiness, husband and wife, trading with the money they had with"
them.
And in time a little child was born to them.
About two or three years after this it became necessary for the husband
"to take a journey, and he started forth with his wife and child. The"
"journey was a very long one, and they were unduly delayed; and so it"
"happened that while still in the forest the wife fell ill, and could not"
"go on any further. So the husband built a hut of branches and leaves,"
"and there, in the solitude of the forest, was born to them another"
little son.
"The mother recovered rapidly, and in a little time she was well enough"
to go on. They were to start next morning on their way again; and in the
"evening the husband went out, as was his custom, to cut firewood, for"
the nights were cold and damp.
"Ma Pa Da waited and waited for him, but he never came back."
"The sun set and the dark rose out of the ground, and the forest became"
"full of whispers, but he never came. All night she watched and waited,"
"shoulder to see what was tickling his fancy so, he frowned and folded"
that document up and returned it to Mr. Jobling.
"""Give it here, now!"" growled Captain Dove, menacing Mr. Jobling with a"
"clenched fist; and the lawyer, after an appealing, impotent glance at"
"Slyne, had no recourse but to comply with that peremptory order."
"""Are you quite sure of your figures?"" Slyne asked, with a scowl. He"
"seemed conscious that he, in his haste, had made a false step. And Mr."
Jobling nodded with nervous assurance.
"""I have inside sources of information as to the revenue of the estates,"""
"he replied, ""and a note of all the investments. I've allowed a wide"
"margin for all sorts of incidentals. I think you'll find, in fact, that"
Lady Josceline's inheritance will amount to even more than I've
"estimated."""
"Slyne smiled again, more contentedly. Nor was his complaisance overcome"
even when Mr. Jobling put to him a half-whispered petition for a
further small cash advance to account of expenses.
"""I wasn't even able to pay Mullins' wages with what you gave me in"
"Paris,"" said the stout solicitor vexedly. ""Fees and so on swallowed it"
"all up, and--I'm actually short of cab-fares!"""
"""Why don't you fire Mullins, then?"" demanded Slyne with a shade of"
"impatience. ""I've just got rid of my chauffeur because he was costing me"
"more than he was worth."""
"""But I can't afford to get rid of Mullins. Just at the moment he's very"
useful to me. It would create a bad impression if I had to run my own
"errands. And--the fact is, he knows far too much. I'll pay him off and"
"“Nothing, fortunately,” he said, then went on slowly. “You see, in my"
"later years, I have been something of a collector of precious stones"
"myself. I don’t wear them, but I have always taken the keenest pleasure"
in owning them and when I was married it gave me a great deal more
"pleasure to have them set in rings, pendants, tiaras, necklaces, and"
other forms for my wife.”
"He had risen, with the air of a busy man who had given the subject all"
the consideration he could afford and whose work proceeded almost by
"schedule. “This morning I found my safe tampered with, but, as I said,"
fortunately something must have scared off the burglars.”
"He bowed us out politely. What was the explanation, I wondered. It"
"seemed, on the face of things, that Antoinette Moulton feared her"
"husband. Did he know something else already, and did she know he knew?"
"To all appearances he took it very calmly, if he did know. Perhaps that"
"was what she feared, his very calmness."
"“I must see Mrs. Moulton again,” remarked Kennedy, as we left."
"The Moultons lived, we found, in one of the largest suites of a new"
"apartment hotel, the Deluxe, and in spite of the fact that our arrival"
"had been announced some minutes before we saw Mrs. Moulton, it was"
evident that she had been crying hysterically over the loss of the
paste jewels and what it implied.
"“I missed it this morning, after my return from seeing you,” she"
"replied in answer to Craig’s inquiry, then added, wide-eyed with alarm,"
“What shall I do? He must have opened the wall safe and found the
replica. I don’t dare ask him point-blank.”
"So we remained till, at last, about two a.m., I caught sight of a"
"light on a small hill not very far away in the west, and, on going"
"over to it, found a sort of recluse, or holy man, quietly cooking his"
food. After the usual courtesies I asked him to come and help me to
pull my car out. He replied that he was an old man and could not do
"much by himself, but that a caravan of nomads, who had arrived the"
"evening before, were encamped close by. So off I went again, flushed"
"my ""quarry"", and, with the help of large bribes, persuaded all the"
able-bodied men to come back to the car. Fortunately we carried a
"good strong rope as part of our kit, so soon had the car out and"
running again.
Allan was never again ordered to drive through water on that route.
[Illustration: IN DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN NASARATABAD AND ROBAT.]
"On the second day our troubles recommenced, for we had barely done"
"a dozen miles than we stuck in another sand-hill, and the laborious"
"digging-out process had to be done all over again. Fortunately, the"
party who had got the car out of the lake the night before were close
"behind, and for an obvious reason. They had been given so many rupees"
"for their timely help that, knowing the difficulties lying ahead,"
they had followed in the hope of further largesse. They got it.
"Once safely out again I made a tour of inspection round the car, but"
only to find more trouble.
"""Hullo, what on earth is this, Allan? She's leaking!"""
"Allan smiled a superior smile. ""I don't think so, sir. My cars don't"
"leak."""
"will reach our friend."""
"""Good, good! Come to my hotel. I will trust you."""
"We went to De Grammont's house, and after taking great precautions"
"against discovery, he gave me a small wooden box wound with yards of tape"
"and sealed with quantities of wax. I put the box in my pocket, saying:--"
"""I accept the trust on my honor, dear count, and though the package bears"
"no name nor address, I shall deliver it to the person for whom it is"
"intended."""
De Grammont said he knew nothing of the contents of the box except that
"it contained a message for a friend, and I believed him."
"When I left his house he came to the door with me, murmuring: ""My"
"gratitude! My gratitude! Also the gratitude of my king, which I hope may"
prove of far greater value to your friend than my poor offering of
"words."""
"I lost no time in seeking George, except to make sure that I was not"
followed. I trusted De Grammont and felt sure that the box he had given
me contained a personal communication from no less a person than Louis
"XIV of France, but I wanted to take no risk of betraying Hamilton by"
leading De Grammont or any one else to his hiding-place.
"Since Frances's providential escape, the king had suspected the right"
"persons of her rescue. At least he suspected Hamilton, and was seeking"
him more diligently than ever before. His Majesty had not shown me any
"mark of disfavor, but I feared he suspected me, and was sure he was not"
convinced that Frances's alibi had been proved by unsuborned testimony.
"If he was sure that she was the one who had been kidnapped, his"
"""Happen to know if he had any relations, sir?"""
"""H'm. He was a widower, I believe."""
"""Children?"""
"""Really,"" said Mr. Kilshaw, with a faint smile, ""I don't know."""
And he escaped from pertinacious Mr. Dawson with some alacrity. When he
"was outside, he stopped suddenly. ""Shall I tell 'em to apply to"
"Medland?"" he asked himself, with a malicious chuckle. ""No, I'll wait a"
"bit yet,"" and he walked on, wondering whether by any chance Mr. Benham"
had been done to death to save the Premier. This fanciful idea he soon
"dismissed with a laugh; it never entered his head, prejudiced as he was,"
"to think that Medland himself had any hand in the matter. After all, he"
"was a man of common sense, and he quickly arrived at a conclusion which"
"he expressed by exclaiming,"
"""The poor fool's been showing his money. Who's got my five hundred now,"
"I wonder?"""
"His wonderings would have been satisfied, had Aladdin's carpet or other"
magical contrivance transported him to where the steamship _Pride of the
"South_ was ploughing her way through the waves, bound from Kirton to San"
"Francisco, with liberty to touch at several South American ports. A"
"thick-set, short man, shipped at the last moment as cook's mate, in"
"substitution for a truant, was lying on his back, smoking a cigarette,"
"looking up at the bright stars, and ever and again gently pressing his"
hand on a little lump inside his shirt. He seemed at peace with all the
"world, though he was ready to be at war, if need be, and his knife,"
"burnished and clean, lay handy to his fingers. He turned on his side and"
"and their superstition. If I get in the first shot, they will bolt. If"
"_he_ does--"""
"""You are going to shoot him down like a rat in a trap!"" Beatrice burst"
out passionately.
The others had already hurried on. With a gentle force he urged her to
follow them.
"""Or be shot down myself,"" he said. ""Leave me to do my duty as I think"
"best."""
"She met his grave eyes defiantly, but perhaps some instinct told her"
"that he was risking his life for a poor chance--for their last chance,"
"for without a word she turned away, apparently in the direction which"
her companions had already taken.
"As soon as she was out of sight, Nicholson recharged his smoking"
"revolver, and stood there quietly waiting. His trained ear heard the"
firing in front of the bungalow cease. He knew then that his men were
"retiring to join Colonel Carmichael, and that he stood alone, the last"
barrier between death and those he loved. The sound of triumphant
shouting drew nearer; he heard the wrenching and tearing of doors
"crashing down before an impetuous onslaught, the cling of steel, a"
howl of sudden satisfaction. His hand tightened upon his revolver; he
"stood ready to meet his enemy single-handed, to fight out the duel"
between man and man. But no one came. A bewildering silence had
followed upon the last bloodthirsty cry. It was as though the hand of
death had fallen and with one annihilating blow beaten down the
approaching horde in the high tide of their victory. But of the two
this strange stillness was the more terrible. It penetrated to the
little waiting group in the old bungalow and filled them with the
At this girl’s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He was
"well-built, active, strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his"
"description seems to follow that of James Williams, divest it of"
anything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp
"corners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt"
under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch.
"While the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry, let me whisper you"
through the low-tuned cardiaphone to sit tight; for now things are
"about to happen, and the great city will close over them again as over"
a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a Broad street
bear.
The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the
last seat. The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her
was her Bluebeard’s chamber.
Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch
"they exchanged their life’s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies."
"And all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided"
whether to draw steel or borrow a match.
"The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together,"
their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents—a comparison
that is not meant to go further. Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the
conference.
"And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man"
in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another
hurried to join him.
The girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm
"Islands, and after these were surrendered by the Dutch, Thomas Morgan was"
left in charge.
In 1686 he sailed in command of a company of buccaneers to assist Governor
"Wells, of St. Kitts, against the French. The defence of the island was"
"disgraceful, and Morgan's company was the only one which displayed any"
"courage or discipline, and most of them were killed or wounded, Colonel"
Morgan himself being shot in both legs.
Often these buccaneer leaders altered their titles from colonel to
"captain, to suit the particular enterprise on which they were engaged,"
according if it took place on sea or land.
"MORGAN, SIR HENRY. Buccaneer."
"This, the greatest of all the ""brethren of the coast,"" was a Welshman,"
born at Llanrhymmy in Monmouthshire in the year 1635. The son of a
"well-to-do farmer, Robert Morgan, he early took to the seafaring life."
"When quite a young man Morgan went to Barbadoes, but afterwards he"
"settled at Jamaica, which was his home for the rest of his life."
"Morgan may have been induced to go to the West Indies by his uncle,"
"Colonel Morgan, who was for a time Deputy Governor of Jamaica, a post Sir"
Henry Morgan afterwards held.
"Morgan was a man of great energy, and must have possessed great power of"
winning his own way with people. That he could be absolutely unscrupulous
"when it suited his ends there can be little doubt. He was cruel at times,"
but was not the inhuman monster that he is made out to be by Esquemeling
"in his ""History of the Bucaniers."" This was largely proved by the evidence"
given in the suit for libel brought and won by Morgan against the
breath. She knew it was over the price to be paid for her that they were
"disputing, but that knowledge had ceased to be any novelty. The wrathful"
voices of the two disputants seemed to come from a great distance. She
felt as if the whole affair were a dream from which she might at any
moment awake on board the _Olive Branch_ again.
"""There isn't money enough in it to pay you so much for a mere"
"affidavit,"" she heard Slyne say, and Mr. Jobling, under his glance,"
confirmed that statement emphatically.
"""A hundred and twenty-one thousand is the last limit--a thousand down,"
"to bind the bargain, and the balance the day of my wedding with Sallie,"""
"Slyne declared. ""If that doesn't satisfy you--there's nothing more to be"
"said. And I'll maybe find other means--"""
"""Show me even the first thousand,"" requested Captain Dove, and Slyne"
"counted out on to the table, at a safe distance from the old man's"
"twitching fingers, five thousand francs of the amount Lord Ingoldsby had"
paid him for his car.
"""All right,"" said Captain Dove gruffly, and snatched at the notes. But"
Slyne picked them up again.
"""As soon as you've given Jobling your statement,"" he said, ""and signed"
"whatever other documents he may think necessary, I'll hand you these and"
"my note of hand, endorsed by him, for the balance remaining due you."""
Mr. Jobling picked up a pen and Slyne pushed a sheet of foolscap toward
"him. Captain Dove, with a grunt of disgust, sat back in his chair and,"
"while the lawyer wrote rapidly, related how he had found Sallie."
"When he had finished, Mr. Jobling read his statement over aloud, and"
"“If you go on in this way,” said Herold, “you 'll soon have as much idea"
of what's going on in London as a lonely dog tied up in a kennel.”
"“What does it matter,” growled John, “to any of the besotted fools who"
"read newspapers, provided I bark loud enough?”"
"There was one thing going on in London, however, in which he took a grim"
"interest, and that was the convalescence of the little maid-of-all-work"
"who had been taken back, a maimed lamb, to the cheerless fold where"
she had been reared. Thither he went to make inquiries as soon as he
returned from Southcliff-on-Sea. He found the Orphanage of St. Martha
"at Willesden, a poverty-stricken building, a hopeless parallelogram of"
"dingy, yellow brick, standing within a walled inclosure. There were no"
"trees or flowers, for the yard was paved. His ring at the front door was"
"answered by an orphan in a light print dress, her meagre hair clutched"
up tight in a knob at the back. He asked for the superintendent and
"handed his card. The orphan conducted him to a depressing parlour, and"
"vanished. Presently appeared a thin, weary woman, dressed in the black"
"robes of a Sister of Mercy, who, holding the card tight in nervous"
"fingers, regarded him with an air of mingled fright and defiance."
“Your business?” she asked.
"Despite the torture of it all, John could not help smiling. If he had"
"been armed with a knout, his reception could not have been more hostile."
"“I must beg of you to believe,” said he, “that I come as a friend and"
not as an enemy.”
She pointed to a straight-backed chair.
"There was also a Baluch Political Officer, known as the Sarhad-dar,"
who worked under orders from the British Political Officer at Quetta.
"The Sarhad-dar, to a certain degree, controlled the Sarhadi Raiders,"
"occasionally with the help of the Chagai Levies, which were raised by"
the Indian Government for this particular work.
Supplies were brought to these scattered posts by camel caravans from
India.
Communication with India was maintained by means of the telegraph.
Later on it became necessary to send out a wireless troop from India
to establish communication between my force at Khwash and Saindak.
At the same time I did my best to learn all I could about the tribes
"amongst whom I was going to operate, their ways and customs, and the"
nature of the country in which they lived.
A glance at the map will show the situation and boundaries of the
Sarhad--literally meaning boundary. It will be seen that it extends
"from Jalk in the East to Galugan in the West. The Eastern part, from"
"Jalk to Safed-koh, is held by a tribe known as the Gamshadzais, under"
"their notable leader, Halil Khan."
The central portion is held by the Yarmahommedzais under Jiand
"Khan, an elderly man, who has been undisputed chief, and a sort of"
"over-lord of the whole of the Sarhad, for very many years. He has"
been looked upon by his own and neighbouring tribes as well-nigh a
"demi-god. As Jiand enters later, and largely, into this narrative all"
further description of him will be reserved till actual contact is
established with him.
"Khwash--known also as Vasht or Washt--is the capital of the Sarhad,"
well if you would summon all the servants of the palace together and arm
"them with such weapons as may be available!"""
"Maria Cristina lifted her head from the shoulder of her Ferdinand, as if"
"she did not at first comprehend Rollo's speech, and was resolved to"
resent an intrusion at such a moment. Whereupon the Scot repeated his
words to such good purpose that the Queen-Regent threw up her hands and
"cried, ""Alas! this happens most unfortunately. We have only old Eugenio"
and a couple of lads in the whole palace since the departure of the
"guards!"""
"""Never mind,"" said Rollo; ""let us make the best of the matter. We will"
muster them; perhaps they will be able to load and fire a musket apiece!
"If I mistake not, the fighting will be at very short range!"""
It was upon this occasion that Señor Fernando Muñoz showed his first
spark of interest.
"""I will go and awake them,"" he said; ""I know where the servants are wont"
"to sleep."""
But on this occasion his fond wife would not permit him to stir.
"""The wicked murderers may have already penetrated to that part of the"
"castle,"" she palpitated, her arms still about his neck, ""and you must"
"not risk your precious life. Let Susana go and fetch them. She is old,"
"and has doubtless made her peace with religion."""
"""Nay, it is not fitting,"" objected Susana with spirit. ""I am a woman,"
and not so old as my lady says. I cannot go gadding about into the
"chambers of all and sundry. Besides, there has been purpose of marriage"
openly declared between me and the Señor Eugenio for upwards of thirty
deferentially.
"""To Grosvenor Square now--and hurry along,"" he directed the driver in a"
voice his enemy could not fail to hear. And the taxicab swung into Drury
"Lane, on its way west."
"For a few minutes he sat silent, with bent head, biting at his"
moustache. Then he looked round at Sallie.
"""That fellow takes me for another man,"" he told her querulously. ""He's"
been dogging me ever since he first saw me at Monte Carlo. You've no
"idea, Sallie, what a dangerous risk I had to run there--for your sake."""
"""You haven't told me much about--anything, Jasper,"" she reminded him."
And he proceeded to describe in lurid detail the fate which would
undoubtedly have befallen him had M. Dubois been able then to fasten on
him responsibility for the misdeeds of that criminal whom he so
unfortunately resembled.
Sallie listened in silence. She had been wondering whether M. Dubois
could be in any way concerned with her affairs. She gathered that he was
interested only in Slyne. The latter's story of grave risk run for her
"sake fell somewhat flat, since it seemed to rest on the mere possibility"
of his having been mistaken for somebody else. She could scarcely
believe that his fear of M. Dubois had no other foundation. She even
ventured to suggest that he could easily have proved the detective in
the wrong.
"""He wouldn't have paid the slightest attention to anything I could say,"""
"Slyne assured her tartly. ""He wouldn't have asked any questions or"
listened to any statement of mine. You don't know anything about the
outrages that are committed every day by fellows like that on men like
"The water’s dropping every minute, and we’ve got a mean stretch to cover"
before we strike the Penobscot. I’ll go back and hustle the rear
along----”
"He stopped abruptly, and whirled around as a voice, shrill and trembling"
"with passion, was raised behind him."
"“You’ll pay for that, you meddlin’ pup! I’ll teach you to go blowin’ up"
"folks’ property, an’ mighty near committin’ murder! I’ll show you you"
can’t play tricks on John Joyce an’ get away with it. That game might
"work with some, but it won’t----”"
Things happened so swiftly after that that even the men standing around
"were quite unable to understand exactly what was doing, and which of the"
two was really the one who started the trouble.
The instant Bob turned he saw that Joyce was either beside himself with
"rage, or giving a most astonishingly good imitation of that condition."
"His face was purple, with veins standing out on his forehead like cords."
His eyes glared with that combination of rage and hate which a badly
frightened man almost invariably feels for the cause of his mental
"disturbance. The automatic was leveled in his hand, and one finger"
trembled on the trigger.
"For a single instant Bainbridge stood rigid, every muscle suddenly"
tensing. Perhaps he read a hint of Joyce’s purpose in the fellow’s eye;
perhaps it was simply intuition which made him guess what was coming. At
"all events, suddenly, and without warning, he launched his lithe body"
through the air exactly as in the manner of the old forbidden flying
tackle.
"His shoulder struck Joyce’s knees, and the wicked, snapping shot of the"

[Footnote 134: The motor imagery suggested by music is in some persons
"profuse and apparently capricious, and may be regarded as an anomaly"
"comparable to a synaesthesia. Heine was an example of this, and he has"
described in _Florentine Nights_ the visions aroused by the playing of
"Paganini, and elsewhere the visions evoked in him by the music of Berlioz."
"Though I do not myself experience this phenomenon, I have found that there"
is sometimes a tendency for music to arouse ideas of motor imagery; thus
some melodies of Handel suggest a giant painting frescoes on a vast wall
space. The most elementary motor relationship of music is seen in the
tendency of many people to sway portions of their body--to 'beat time'--in
sympathy with the music. (This phenomenon has been experimentally studied
"by J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement"
"to the _Psychological Review_, vol. v., No. 4, June 1903). Music is"
"fundamentally an audible dance, and the most primitive music is dance"
music.]
[Footnote 135: The instinctive nature of this tendency is shown by the
fact that it persists even in sleep. Thus Weygandt relates that he once
fell asleep in the theatre during one of the last scenes of _Cavalleria
"Rusticana_, when the tenor was singing in ever higher and higher tones,"
and dreamed that in order to reach the notes the performer was climbing up
ladders and stairs on the stage.]
Concha smiled a subtle smile and turned her eyes upon the ground.
"""If you will remember, I had other matters to communicate to your"
"Excellency,"" she said meekly--almost too meekly, Rollo thought. ""This"
"matter of Luis Fernandez slipped my memory, till it was my good fortune"
"to be reminded of it by Don Ramon!"""
"And all the while the long lean Sergeant Cardono, his elbows glued to"
"his sides, sat his horse as if spiked to the saddle, and chuckled with"
quiet glee at the scene.
"""He will do yet,"" he muttered; ""'twas ever thus that my father told me"
of the Gran' Lor' before Salamanca. Be he as stiff as a ramrod and as
"frigid as his own North Pole, the little one will thaw him--bend"
him--make a fool of him for his soul's good. She is not an Andaluse of
"the gipsy blood for nothing! He will make him a soldier yet, this young"
"man, by the especial grace of San Vicente de Paul, only I do not think"
that either of them will deserve readmission to the Convent of the Holy
"Innocents!"""
More than once Rollo endeavoured to extract from Concha to what place
"her self-assumed mission was taking her, and at what point she would"
leave them. It was in vain. The lady baffled all his endeavours with the
most consummate ease.
"""You have not communicated to me,"" she said, ""the purport of your own"
"adventures. How then can I tell at what place our ways divide?"""
"""I am forbidden to reveal to any save General Cabrera alone my secret"
"instructions!"" said Rollo, with such dignity as he could muster at short"
notice.
other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other
"during the lecture, but not _my_ sister! She hung on every word, took"

something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an
edible one. The wild _dunging_ drug is harvested there by criminal
"speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing"
"in recent years. In fact--"""
"""Pardon me, sir,"" I broke in, ""but doesn't _dunging_ come only from"
Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?
"You remember, purser--Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the"

"The purser nodded slowly. ""I forgot,"" he admitted. ""Sorry, ladies, but"
"the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes."""
"But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one."
"She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while"
I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture
of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the
opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out
with her.
"""Ferdinand,"" Sis said, ""let's go back to our cabin."""
Something was wrong. The shelling of the back-areas continued; air-raids
became more and more frequent. These were ominous signs.
Then the newspapers arrived. The Somme front had collapsed. The Fifth
Army was in full retreat. The Germans had taken Bapaume and Peronne and
were threatening Amiens.
*       *       *       *       *
Had I been living in Germany during the war I would have felt a powerful
"tendency to defend the cause of the Allies, to excuse their misdeeds, to"
"overrate their ability, while being highly critical and censorious of"
every German shortcoming.
"A nation at war is a mob whose very blatancy, injustice and cruelty"
drive one to hatred and opposition. The enemy mob seems less detestable
"because it is out of sight and one thinks almost involuntarily: ""It"
"cannot be as bad as our own."""
I could not bear to hear a victory joyfully announced. The jubilation
"and the self-glorification of the crowd filled me with loathing, and I"
could only think of the intensified slaughter and misery that are the
"price of every victory. They who pay the price, they alone have the"
"right to rejoice, but they do not rejoice. The German mob revealed its"
depravity when it hung out flags in the streets to celebrate the first
"German victories. And, when the first battle of Cambrai was won, London"
jeered at the bereaved and mocked the dead by ringing the joy-bells.
Every genuine patriot is called a traitor in his own country. But
"patriotism, however genuine, is a thing that must be surmounted. There"
"is only one good that war can bring to a nation--defeat. A patriot,"
"loving his own country, would therefore wish his country defeat in war."
trace of her did he find. But what he did discover solved the mystery
of the grewsome feast of death which he had just witnessed. In a
"corner where he had dropped it, there lay a silken banderol belonging"
"to a man-at-arms of Anjou's Provencals. They had been here, and the"
"nuns, to escape the violation of their bodies, had died, thus cheating"
the fiends out of the gratification of their lusts.
The terrible discovery unnerved Francesco so completely that for a
"time he stood as if turned to stone, looking about him like a"
traveller who has stumbled blindly into a charnel house. Urged by
"manifold forebodings, he then rushed from room to room, from cell to"
cell. The same silence met him everywhere. Of Ilaria he found not a
"trace. Had the fiends of Anjou carried her away, or had she, in"
"endeavoring to escape, found her death outside of the walls of San"
Nicandro?
He dared not think out the thought.
"The shadows of the place, the staring faces, the stiff hands clawing"
"at things inanimate, were like the phantasms of the night. Francesco"
took the sea-air into his nostrils and looked up into the blue
radiance of the sky. All about him the garden glistened in the dawn;
the cypresses shimmered with dew. The late roses made very death more
apparent to his soul.
"As he stood in deep thought, half dreading what he but half knew, a"
"voice called to him, breaking suddenly the ponderous silence of the"
"place. Guided by its sound, Francesco unlatched the door and found"
himself face to face with the Duke of Spoleto.
For a moment they faced each other in silence.
Rollo coloured high.
"""General,"" he said, ""I will not conceal it from you that I have wasted"
too much time already; but if you wish for our assistance in your
"designs for twenty-four hours, I am not the man to deny you."""
"""I thought not,"" cried Cabrera, much pleased. ""And now have you any"
"business to despatch before we leave this place? If so, let it be seen"
"to at once!"""
"""None, Excellency,"" said Rollo, ""save that if you are satisfied of our"
good faith I should like to see Luis Fernandez the miller dealt with
"according to his deserts!"""
"""I will have him shot instantly,"" cried Cabrera; ""he hath given false"
tidings to his Majesty's generals. He hath belied his honest servants.
"Guard, bring Luis Fernandez hither!"""
This was rather more than Rollo had bargained for. He was not yet
"accustomed to the summary methods of Cabrera, even though the butcher's"
hand had hardly yet unclosed from himself. He was already meditating an
"appeal in favour of milder measures, when the guard returned with the"
"news that Luis Fernandez was nowhere to be found. Dwelling-house,"
"strong-room, mill, garden, and gorge beneath--all had been searched. In"
vain--they were empty and void. The tumbled beds where the general and
"his staff had slept, the granary with its trampled heaps of corn ready"
"for grinding, the mill-wheel with the pool beneath where the lights and"
"shadows played at bo-peep, where the trout lurked and the water-boxes"
seemed to descend into an infinity of blackness--all were deserted and
lonesome as if no man had been near them for a hundred years.
"""The rascal has escaped!"" cried Cabrera, full of rage; ""have I not told"
Then he saw a gleam of blue metal in Fraser's hands.
"""Give me that gun!"" he panted, but his deliverer held him off."
"""I may need it myself, and I ain't got but the one here! Let's get"
"Clyde out of this."""
"Stepping over the motionless form at his feet, Fraser lifted the young"
"club-man, who was huddled in a formless heap as if he had fallen from a"
"great height, and together the two dragged him toward _The Bedford"
"Castle_. As they went aboard, they were nearly run down by a body of"
reinforcements that Captain Peasley had finally mustered from between
"decks. Down the gang-plank and over the side they poured, grimy"
"stokers, greasy oilers, and swearing deckhands, equipped with"
"capstan-bars, wrenches, and marlin-spikes. Without waiting to observe"
"the effect of these new-comers, Boyd and Fraser bundled Alton into the"
"first cabin at hand, then turned back."
"""Better stay here and look after him. You're all in, yourself,"" the"
"adventurer advised. ""I'm going to hunt up George."""
"He was away on the instant, with Boyd staggering after him, still weak"
"and shaking, the vague discomfort of running blood at the back of his"
"neck, muttering thickly as he went: ""Give me your gun, Fraser! Give me"
"your gun!"""
"The battle was still raging when the police arrived, after an"
"interminable delay, and it ceased only at the rough play of"
"night-sticks, and after repeated charges of the uniformed men had"
"broken up the ranks of the strikers. The dock was cleared at length,"
"and wagon-loads of bleeding, struggling combatants rolled away to jail,"
union and non-union men bundled in together. But work was not resumed
"peculiar conditions of this particular drive, and before Bainbridge"
realized it he had given a brief narrative of his fight with the Lumber
Trust and the events which had grown out of it.
"“You interest me extraordinarily, Mr. Bainbridge,” the older man said,"
"in his crisp, decisive way, when at last they paused at the point"
"several miles below the scene of the last jam, where Sears had to branch"
"off to reach his camp. “Things of this sort always do, for it’s only"
those one has to struggle for which are really worth while. You’ve
"certainly had to fight hard in this case, but you’ve practically won"
"out, haven’t you? After this last fracas I shouldn’t suppose there’d be"
much chance for further interference.”
Bob shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. “You sadly underestimate
"the power of the trust, Mr. Sears. I shan’t be beyond the chance of"
"interference until the drive is safe in our mill booms at Lancaster, and"
even then it wouldn’t surprise me if they’d try to work some dirty
trick.”
Sears frowned indignantly; then his face brightened.
“In spite of everything I think I should bet on you.” he chuckled.
“There’s a certain vigor in your method of dealing with these people
"which makes for success. I really believe you’ll win, Mr. Bainbridge,"
"and I surely hope so. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, and I"
"trust one to be repeated. I shall be hereabouts for some time yet, and"
may run across you before I leave.”
"Bob warmly reciprocated his feeling, and, after a hearty handshake,"
"turned south along the river, while Sears disappeared in the undergrowth"
to the westward.
disturbances Captain Peasley made his way shoreward from the ship to
"scan the scene, and the sight of his uniform excited the ire of the"
"strikers afresh. After a glance over the mob, he remarked to Emerson:"
"""Bli'me! It looks like a bloody riot already, doesn't it? Four hundred"
pounds to those dock wallopers! Huh! You know if I allowed them to
"bleed me that way--"""
"At that instant, from some quarter, a railroad spike whizzed past the"
"Captain's head, banging against the boards behind him with such a thump"
that the dignified Englishman ducked quickly amid a shout of derision.
He began to curse them roundly in his own particular style.
"""You'd better keep under cover, Captain,"" advised Emerson. ""They don't"
"seem to care for you."""
"""So it would appear,"" he agreed. ""They're getting nawsty, aren't they?"
"I hope it doesn't lawst."""
"""Well, I hope it does,"" said George Balt. ""If they'll only keep at it"
and beat up some of our boys at quitting-time the whole gang will be
"here in the morning."""
"It seemed that his wishes bade fair to be realized, for, as the day"
"wore on, instead of diminishing, the excitement increased. By evening"
it became so menacing that Boyd was forced to send in an urgent demand
"for a squadron of bluecoats to escort his men to their lodgings, and it"
was only by the most vigorous efforts that a serious clash was averted.
Nor was this task the easier since it did not meet with the approval of
"the fishermen themselves, who keenly resented protection of any sort."
"True to George's prediction, the next morning found the non union men"
"“Thank you--Curly,” Bainbridge said in a level voice. “That was"
touch-and-go for a minute.”
"That was all, but somehow Curly knew that what he had done was"
understood and appreciated. In the stress of the peril which the two had
"shared shoulder to shoulder like common brother river hogs, Kollock’s"
anger and hate had vanished utterly. He no longer desired revenge. His
attitude of a scant half hour before seemed small and mean and petty. He
"had saved the life of the man his brother wanted out of the way, and,"
"given the opportunity, he would do it as promptly again."
CHAPTER XIII. THE LIMIT
Curly Kollock’s interest and liking for his boss grew stronger day after
day. There was something about Bob Bainbridge which stirred the finer
"qualities in his nature, and brought twinges of shame to the young"
riverman whenever he thought how near he had come to throwing his lot
with his brother. If Bill ever showed up he resolved to tell him just
"what he thought of him, too. But in the meantime, not being much of a"
"penman, he made no effort to answer the letter. It was sufficient that"
he considered himself cut loose from the whole miserable bunch. If they
were expecting aid from him in their plotting they were doomed to
disappointment.
"More and more often as they descended the Katahdin River, the boy was"
stirred to anger at the constant succession of moves made by that gang
of crooks against the man who fought them practically alone and
singlehanded.
Along the river were several dams placed for the purpose of regulating
the head of water and facilitating the process of driving. They belonged
The duke's features were hard as steel. Yet he read the other's humor
and joined him with the zest of the hour.
"""You smile once more!"" said the grim lord of the woods, turning to the"
slender form in the saddle.
"""I shall smile in the hour when the Frangipani lies at my feet,"""
"Francesco replied with heaving chest. ""It is good to be strong!"""
"The duke's horsemen were scouring ahead, keeping cover, scanning the"
"horizon for the Provencals. By noon they had left the open land,"
plunged up hills covered thick with woods. The duke's squadrons sifted
"through, and he halted them in the woods under the brow of the hill."
"Below lay a broad valley running north and south, chequered with"
pine-thickets and patches of brushwood. On a hill in the centre stood
a ruined tower. Towards the south a broad loop of the river closed the
"valley, while all around on the misty hills shimmered the giants of"
"the forest, mysterious and silent. The duke's outriders had fallen"
back and taken cover in the thickets. Down the valley could be seen a
"line of spears, glittering snake-like towards the tower on the hill."
"Companies of horse were crossing the river, pushing up the slopes,"
mass on mass. In the midst of the flickering shields and spears blew a
great banner with the Fleur-de-Lis.
"It was a contingent of Charles of Anjou, which had been on the march"
since dawn. They had thrown their advance guard across the river and
"were straggling up the green slopes, while the main host crossed the"
ford.
The sound of a clarion re-echoed from crag to crag: and down towards
"seize them in my strong arms, I will bear them harmless through the"
falling rafters and the blazing beams.’ Then the sad thought came
to him that the children were romping and ignorant. ‘If I say the
"house is on fire, they will not understand me. If I try to seize"
"them, they will romp about and try to escape. Alas! not a moment to"
be lost!’ Suddenly a bright thought flashed across the old man's
"mind. ‘My children are ignorant,’ he said; ‘they love toys and"
glittering playthings. I will promise them playthings of unheard-of
beauty. Then they will listen.’
"So the old man shouted: ‘Children, come out of the house and see"
"these beautiful toys! Chariots with white oxen, all gold and"
tinsel. See these exquisite little antelopes. Whoever saw such
"goats as these? Children, children, come quickly, or they will all"
be gone!’
Forth from the blazing ruin the children came in hot haste. The
word ‘plaything’ was almost the only word they could understand.
"Then the Father, rejoiced that his offspring was freed from peril,"
procured for them one of the most beautiful chariots ever seen:
the chariot had a canopy like a pagoda: it had tiny rails and
balustrades and rows of jingling bells. Milk-white oxen drew the
chariot. The children were astonished when they were placed inside.”
(_From the “Thabagata.”_)
"Perhaps, as a compromise, one might give the gentler superstitions to"
"very small children, and leave such a blood-curdling story as Bluebeard"
to a more robust age.
There is one modern method which has always seemed to me much to be
"condemned, and that is the habit of changing the end of a story, for"
"to them was barred. For a long, dull period the voyagers lay as"
"helpless as if in dry-dock, while wandering herds of seals barked at"
them or bands of walruses ceased their fishing and crept out upon the
ice-pans to observe these invaders of their peace. When an opportunity
"at last presented itself, they threaded their way southward, there to"
"try another approach, and another, and another, until the first of May"
"had come and gone, leaving them but little closer to their goal than"
when they first hove-to. Late one evening they discerned smoke on the
"horizon, and the next morning's light showed a three-masted steamship"
"fast in the ice, a few miles to the westward."
"""That's _The Juliet_,"" Big George informed his companions, ""one of the"
"North American Packers' Association tenders."""
"""She was loading when we left Seattle,"" Boyd remarked."
"""It is Willis Marsh's ship, so he must be aboard,"" supplemented Cherry."
"""She's a wooden ship, and built for this business. If we don't look out"
"he'll beat us in, after all."""
"""What good will that do him?"" Clyde questioned. ""The fish don't bite--I"
"mean run--for sixty days yet."""
Emerson and Balt merely shrugged.
To Cherry Malotte this had been a voyage of dreams; for once away from
"land, Boyd had become his real self again--that genial, irrepressible"
self she had seen but rarely--and his manner had lost the restraint and
coolness which recently had disturbed their relations. Of necessity
"their cramped environment had thrown them much together, and their"
companionship had been most pleasant. She and Boyd had spent long hours
"together, during which his light-heartedness had rivalled that of Alton"
"obvious reluctance, glancing out of his little oblique eyes at the young"
colonel.
Rollo considered a while before answering.
"""It is my opinion that the fewer men concerned in such a venture the"
"greater the chances of success,"" he said at last; ""furnish me with one"
petty officer intimately acquainted with the country between Zaragoza
"and San Ildefonso, and I will ask no more."""
Cabrera drew a long breath and looked at the young man with infinitely
more approval than he had before manifested.
"""You are right,"" he said, ""three times right! If you fail, there are"
fewer to go to the gallows. In prison fewer ill-sewn wine-skins to leak
"information. If you succeed, there are also fewer to divide the credit"
"and the reward. For my own part, I do not think you will succeed, but I"
will provide you with the best man in my command for your purpose and in
"addition heartily wish you well out of your adventure!"""
Cabrera was indeed immensely relieved to find the desires of our hero so
moderate. He had been directed to supply him with whatever force he
"required, and he expected to be deprived of a regiment at least, at a"
most critical time in the affairs of the Absolute King.
"""Young man,"" he said, ""you will certainly be shot or hanged before you"
are a month older. Nevertheless in the mean time I would desire to have
"the honour of shaking you by the hand. If you were not to die so soon,"
undoubtedly you would go far! It is a pity. And the Cristinos are bad
shots. They will not do the job half as creditably as my fellows would
"have done it for you this morning!"""
"“Ah, yes, to be sure. Poor little Unity! You must bring her to see me"
"sometimes. Give me notice, and I 'll make her some of my cream-puffs."
Children are always so fond of them. _You_ ought to remember my
cream-puffs.”
"“Good heavens!” he cried, with a gesture that set the dog barking."
“There 's no question of cream-puffs. Can't you see what I'm driving at?
I want you to come and keep house for me and help me to look after the
child.”
"He rose, and his great form towered so threateningly over her that Dandy"
barked at him with a toy terrier's furious and impotent rage.
“I come and live with you?” gasped Miss Lindon.
[Illustration: 0094]
"“Yes,” said John, turning away and lumbering back to the fireplace. The"
"dog, perceiving that he had struck terror into the heart of his enemy,"
"dismissed him with a scornful snarl, and curled himself up by the side"
of his stupefied mistress.
"It was done; the proposal had been made, according to the demands of his"
"pig-headedness. Now that he had made it, he realized its insanity. He"
contrasted this home of flim-flammeries and its lap-dogs and canaries
and old-maidish futilities with his own tobacco-saturated and
paper-littered den; this life of trivialities with his own fighting
career; this incapacity to grasp essentials with his own realization of
the conflict of world-forces. The ludicrous incongruity of a partnership
between the two of them in so fateful a business as the healing of a
human soul appealed to his somewhat dull sense of humour. The whole idea
was preposterous. In his saturnine way he laughed.
"kept explaining all the way home how the accident had happened, what he"
"had said and what the lawyer had said, pointing to objects on the way as"
though this stone represented the lawyer and that the abyss into which he
had plunged.... Solem still carried the rope he had not had a chance to
"use. Miss Torsen asked no more than anyone else, and made purely"
"conventional comments: ""I advised him against it, I begged him not to"
"go...."""
"But however much we talked, we could not bring the lawyer back to life."
"Strange--his watch was still going, but he himself was dead. The doctor"
"could do nothing here, and returned to his village."
There followed a depressing evening. Solem went to the village to send a
"telegram to the lawyer's family, and the rest of us did what we thought"
decent under the circumstances: we all sat in the living room with books
"in our hands. Now and again, some reference would be made to the accident:"
"it was a reminder, we said, how small we mortals were! And the Associate"
"Master, who had not the soul of a tourist, greatly feared that this"
disaster would injure the resort and make things still more difficult for
Paul; people would shun a place where they were likely to fall off and be
killed.
"No, the Associate Master was no tourist, and did not understand the"
Anglo-Saxon mind.
Paul himself seemed to sense that the accident might benefit him rather
than do him harm. He brought out a bottle of brandy to console us on this
mournful evening.
"And since it was a death to which we owed this attention, one of the men"
from Bergen made a speech.
were demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with tunes. Early tune
"versions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The latest edition,"
"printed in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best Psalm tunes"
"which had gradually come into use, many of them arranged with"
“Faux-bourdon” (wherein the congregation sings one or more verses to the
"melody while the choir supplies the harmony), and “Descant” (a second"
melody over that of the tune).
"f. _The New Version_, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version"
"gradually supplanted the _Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins, and"
held its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was
"adopted, in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United"
States and bound with the prayer book of that Communion.
The above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters that
"were published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in Great"
"Britain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for the"
singing church. They were intended to restore song to the people in
"their worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales"
in Germany.
"Some of the psalm books were published without music, some with the"
"melody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is"
frequently made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison
"singing. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice"
"parts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first"
"encouraged unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of"
amusement than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness
"of singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal"
in this respect.
“I went to work in a millinery shop.” She shrugged her slender
"shoulders. “They starved me too,” she said--“just like the widow"
Snacheur. So----”
"She slipped her hand through his arm, laid her head against his"
"shoulder, and smiled:"
“But do not let us think of these things--it is so warm here.”
"The touch of the affectionate hands, the childlike caress of the girl,"
"the confidence and the clinging of her warm body to him, thrilled him."
She was in all the fresh beauty of her young womanhood; and the simple
"black gown, threadbare and worn as it was, only enhanced the beauty of"
her skin and pronounced the delicacy of her colour and the richness of
her splendid hair.
The girl increased the restlessness that had possessed the youth all
day. She brought to him the sweet whiteness and the subtle grace of
Betty--filled his senses with the atmosphere of the handsome girl who
had filled all his dreams from boyhood. It brought to him the most
"importunate craving of man, the love of woman."
Noll sat brooding for awhile. Yet even in the vigorous lust of life
"that held his young years, even as he sat there in the thrill of his"
"sweetest memories, he vaguely felt the gentle presence of these simple"
faded artistic folk about him; and he realized how indelibly the word
"Failure was written across them all. The coats were, if anything, more"
faded; the shoes more worn; the eyes alone lit up with the wonted glow
of delight in art. A little praise was their rich barmecidal feast.
"The greybeards, and the youths, and those between, they were all still"
"hoping to create the masterpiece--there was not, amongst them all,"
labour. In the telegram from London Mr. Chamberlain states that the
Viceroy has informed him that Indians will be eligible for commissions
in the New Defence of India Army.
MARCH OF WORLD TRAGEDY
In the meantime the Embodiment of World Tragedy is marching with giant
strides. Brief will be his hesitation whether he will choose to step
"first to the East or to the West. Already across the Atlantic, they are"
preparing for the dreaded visitation. In the farthest East they have
long been prepared. We alone are not ready. Pity for our helplessness
"will not stay the impending disaster, rather provoke it. When that"
"comes, as assuredly it will unless we are prepared to resist, havoc will"
be let loose and horrors perpetrated before which the imagination quails
back in dismay.
I have tried to lay before you as dispassionately as I could the issues
"involved. But some of you may cry out and say, we can not live in cold"
scientific and philosophic abstractions. Emotion is more to us than pure
reasoning. We cannot stay in this indecision which is paralysing our
wills and crushing the soul out of us. The world is offering their best
and behold them marching to be immolated so that by the supreme offering
of death they might win safety and honor for their motherland. There is
no time for wavering. We too will throw in our lot with those who are
fighting. They say that by our lives we shall win for our birth-land an
honoured place in their federation. We shall trust them. We shall stand
by their side and fight for our home and homeland. And let Providence
shape the Issue.

"immediately followed the accident, and lasted some days. There"
"was no sickness, the bowels were confined three days, and there"
was pain across the back and down the thigh.
"On the tenth day he arrived at the Base, when he was lying on"
his back suffering considerable pain. The temperature ranged to
"101°. There was diarrhoea and cystitis, with a considerable"
"amount of pus in the urine, which was very offensive. A small"
"fluctuating spot existed on the back, just to the right of the"
original exit wound which was firmly healed. The abdomen moved
"fairly with respiration in its upper part, but was motionless"
"below, especially in the right iliac fossa; some induration was"
to be felt here. The right thigh was kept flexed.
"During the next few days the pus disappeared from the urine,"
and with this change the induration in the right iliac fossa
increased. An incision (Mr. Gairdner) was made into the
"fluctuating spot behind, and pus evacuated. The patient"
recovered.

"The description did fit Gates like an old glove, yet his most dominant"
characteristic was an unfailing loyalty to our family and an honest
"bluntness, both of which had become as generally recognized as his skill"
"in handling the _Whim_--""the smartest schooner yacht,"" he would have"
"told you on a two-minute acquaintanceship, ""that ever tasted salt."""
"""We might open the cottage for a few days, Gates,"" I said, as we were"
getting into the motor.
"""Bless you, sir,"" he replied, caressing a weather-beaten chin with thumb"
"and finger, ""the _Whim_'s been tugging at her cable mighty fretful this"
"parst fortnight! The crew hoped you'd be coming aboard at once, sir."
"Fact is, we're wanting to be told how you and Mr. Thomas, here, licked"
"those Germans."""
"""Angels of the Marne protect me,"" Tommy groaned. ""Gates, I wouldn't"
"resurrect those scraps for the Kaiser's scalp!"""
"""Yes, he will,"" I promised, smiling at the old fellow's look of"
"disappointment. ""He'll probably talk you to death, though; that's the"
"only trouble."""
"""I'll tell you what,"" Tommy said, ""we'll chuck the cottage idea and go"
"aboard; then tonight, Gates, you pipe the crew--if that's the nautical"
"term--whereupon I'll hold a two-hour inquest over our deceased war, on"
condition that we bury the subject forever more. We came down here to
"lose the last eighteen months of our lives, Gates, not keep 'em green."
"Maybe you don't know it, but we're after the big adventure!"""
"His eyes twinkled as he said this, and his face was lighted by a rare"
smile that no one possessed more engagingly than Tommy. While he treated
any serious commiseration.
"When he did come to death-grapple with the absolute, the beasts above"
"mentioned, he stood out a tragic young figure, fiercely alone in the"
"arena, save for Herold."
"His name, uncommon and arresting, had one connotation in London--the"
"Case, the appalling and abominable Case. Even Ferguson of the “Daily"
"Herald,” who had evinced such sympathy for him at first, shrank from the"
name at the head of the weekly column and suggested the temporary use of
"a pseudonym. Had it not been for Herold's intervention, Risca would have"
told Ferguson to go to the devil and would have refused to work for his
"Philistine paper. He swallowed the insult, which did him no good. He"
refused to carry the accursed name into the haunts of men.
"“Come to the club, at any rate,” Herold urged. “Every man there is loyal"
to you.”
“And every man as he looks at me will have on his retina not a picture
"of me, but a picture of what went on in that house in Smith Street.”"
"“Oh, go and buy a serviceable epidermis,” cried Herold. Argument was"
useless.
So Risca worked like a mole at anonymous journalism in his shabby
lodgings where Lilias and Niphetos were suggested only by a mangy tabby
"who occasionally prowled into his sitting-room, and Arachne presided,"
"indeed, but in the cobwebs about the ceiling in the guise which she had"
been compelled to take by the angry god when the world was young. Only
"when his attendance at the office of the weekly review was necessary,"
"such as on the day when it went to press, did he mingle with the busy"
world.
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. The heavy near-shore formations of the
Silurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The
"Medina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio,"
where the first passes into a shale and the second into a
"limestone. The Niagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson"
"River to beyond the Mississippi, a distance of more than a"
thousand miles. During the Silurian period the Mississippi valley
"region was covered with a quiet, shallow, limestone-making sea,"
which received little waste from the low lands which bordered it.
The probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America
and western Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the
interior region and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that
"of western Europe, and several species are identical. We can"
hardly account for this except by a shallow-water connection
between the two ancient epicontinental seas. It was perhaps along
the coastal shelves of a northern land connecting America and
Europe by way of Greenland and Iceland that the migration took
"place, so that the same species came to live in Iowa and in"
Sweden.
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. So little is found of the rocks of the
system west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that
the western part of the United States had for the most part
emerged from the sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained
land during the Silurian. At the same time the western land was
perhaps connected with the eastern land of Appalachia across
Arkansas and Mississippi; for toward the south the Silurian
sediments indicate an approach to shore.
LIFE OF THE SILURIAN
"coquetry showing through her grave demeanour, ""a secret mission from the"
Mother Superior of the Convent of the Holy Innocents. Do not attempt to
penetrate the secret. I assure you it will be quite useless. And pray do
"not suppose that only you can adventure forth on perilous quests!"""
"""I assure you,"" began Rollo, eagerly, ""that I suppose no such thing. At"
the moment when you came up I was wishing with all my heart that the
responsibility of the present undertaking had been laid on any other
"shoulders than mine!"""
"Yet in spite of his modesty, certain it is that from that moment Rollo"
rode no longer with his head hanging down like a willow blown by the
wind. The reins lay no more lax and abandoned on his horse's neck. On
"the contrary, he sat erect and looked abroad with the air of a"
"commander, and his hand rested oftener on the hilt of Killiecrankie,"
with the air of pride which Concha privately thought most becoming.
"""And in what case left you my wife and babe?"" suddenly demanded El"
"Sarria, riding up, and inquiring somewhat imperiously of the new"
recruit concerning the matter which touched him most nearly.
"""The Señora Dolóres is safe with the good sisters, and as in former"
"times I was known to have been her companion, it was judged safest that"
I should not longer be seen in the neighbourhood. Likewise I was charged
with the tidings that Luis Fernandez with a company of Cristino
"Migueletes has been seen riding southward to cut you off from Madrid,"
"whither it is supposed you are bound!"""
Rollo turned quickly upon her with some anger in his eye.
"""Why did you not tell me that at first?"" he said."
"the wholesale slaughter, not only of those in the palace, but also of"
the inhabitants of the town of San Ildefonso.
"Then in her turn La Giralda told of her visit to the pavilion, of the"
"little Queen, passionate, joyous, kindly natured, absolutely Spanish,"
till the hearts of her hearers melted to the tale.
"""Our orders are to capture her and her mother the Regent,"" said Rollo,"
"thoughtfully. ""It would therefore serve our purpose but ill if we"
permitted these two to be sacrificed to the bloodthirsty fury of a mob
"of plunderers!"""
"""Then the sooner we find ourselves within the gates, the more chance we"
"shall have of saving them both!"" said the Sergeant. ""Serve out the"
"_puchero_, La Giralda!"""
Concha had taken no part in the discussion. But she had listened with
"all her ears, and now in the pause that followed she declared her"
unalterable intention of making one of the party.
"""I also am of Andalucia,"" she said with calm determination, ""there are"
two others of my country here who will answer for me. You cannot leave
"me alone, and La Giralda will be needed as guide when once you reach the"
"palace precincts. I shall not be in the way, I promise you, and if it"
"comes to gun and pistol, there I think you will not find me wanting!"""
"In his heart and though he made several objections, Rollo was glad"
enough to give way. For with all the unknown dangers of the night before
"them, and the certainty of bloodshed when the gipsies should attack, he"
relished still less the thought of leaving Concha alone in that pit on
the chill side of Guadarrama.
"Instantly a voice answered, ""I am Idu of the Chagai Levies, friendly"
"to the British Government."""
"I then called out who I was, and, immediately, three fully armed men"
came forward in the darkness.
"I asked them what they were doing there, and the voice that had"
answered me before replied that they were all three members of the
"Chagai Levies, and that they, and about fifty others, had come out to"
fight me.
"""To fight me?"" I exclaimed. ""Whatever for?"""
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned the man who had said his name was Idu, ""we"
"thought you were a German airship."" And he went on to explain that"
for a long time he and his companions had been watching powerful
"lights floating about in the sky, and as they knew that Germans were"
"the only people in the world who had _hawaiijihaz_ or airships, they"
were convinced the lights they had seen belonged to one of these. And
"when it had alighted on the hill in front of them, the majority of"
"his companions had been so terrified that they had run away, and only"
himself and his two comrades had had the bravery to stay where they
were and face the unknown danger.
Then it dawned on me what he was driving at. The flashing electric
"lights of the car, lighting up the distant, rising slopes of the"
"desert, had appeared to these men to come from the sky, and my"
"harmless motor-car the dreaded German airship. Cars, of course, along"
"this route were as great a novelty as airships, and doubtless not one"
of the men in front of me had ever seen one before.
"I reassured them as completely as I could, adding that I was"
was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists
"weren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd"
"always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,"
rather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill
"of the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty"
sort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better--more
"disciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,"
which helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.
*       *       *       *       *
"The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was"
"also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though"
he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.
"Still, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even"
the Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!
Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal
"features, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the"
tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had
"handed him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for"
"next year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet"
"minds--profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising"
"simplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were"
alike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical
"shorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines."
The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice
nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly
put it away. No one spoke.

than by the Secretary of State alone. Indians were under a great
"difficulty, in that they could not remain indefinitely in England after"
taking their degrees and being away from the place of recruitment their
claims were overlooked.
"83,643. There was no reason why a European should be paid a higher rate"
of salary than an Indian on account of the distance he came. An Indian
felt a sense of inferiority if a difference was made as regards pay. The
very slight saving which government made by differentiating between the
two did not compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This feeling would
"remain even if the pay was the same, but an additional grant in the"
shape of a foreign service allowance was made to Europeans. All workers
"in the field of education should feel a sense of solidarity, because"
"they were all serving one great cause, namely, education."
"83,644. The term ""professor"", as at present used in India, was"
"undoubtedly a comprehensive one, but it was equally comprehensive in the"
West.
"83,645. (Sir Murray Hammick). The witness did not wish to recruit"
definite proportions of the service in England and in India
respectively. He would for various reasons prefer a large number of
Indians engaged in education.
"83,646. Even in Calcutta he would not make any difference between the"
pay of the Indian and the pay of the European.
"83,647. (Sir Valentine Chirol). The witness attached great value to the"
influence of the teacher upon the student in the earlier stages of his
"education, and it was in these stages that that influence could best be"
exercised. At the same time he desired to limit the appointment of
non-Indians to men of very great distinction.
"itself.""[7] The mere Ã¦sthetic sensibility makes but a new artist; what"
"makes the critic is his philosophy. Here also, however, as during the"
"whole course of our inquiry, we must not identify philosophy with the"
"official history of philosophical disciplines, which offers a large"
number of theories of Ã¦sthetics only remotely related to the concrete
"works of art, to the concrete processes of Ã¦sthetic creation, but with"
"the whole history of human thought, with the working out of particular"
problems successively presented to the intelligence of man by the
"actual developments of poetry and art. The Ã¦sthetic judgment, like"
"every other judgment, is a synthesis of the individual intuition, or"
"subject, and of the universal category, or predicate; and this is but"
"another way of stating the identity of Ã¦sthetic criticism, as of all"
"forms of history, with philosophy. The critic must be endowed with a"
"power to give new life, within his own mind, to the intuitions of the"
"artist, but this is for him but the soil in which his thought must"
"spread its roots; it is true that without that power, no criticism"
"is possible, but it is equally true that no philosophy of art can"
grow on any but that same soil. The ultimate test of the validity of
Ã¦sthetic thought is in its capacity to expand our sphere of Ã¦sthetic
apprehension; and pure Ã¦sthetics is but the methodological moment of
Ã¦sthetic history or criticism.

"(163) Wounded at Rensburg. _Entry_ (Mauser), in ninth left"
"intercostal space in posterior axillary line; _exit_, a"
transverse slit 1/2 an inch in length to left of xiphoid
"appendage. Patient was retiring when struck; he did not fall,"
"but ran for about 1,000 yards, whence he was conveyed to"
hospital. He vomited half an hour after the injury (last meal
"bread and 'bully beef,' taken two hours previously), and during"
"the evening three times again, the vomit consisting mainly 'of"
"dark thick blood.' He was put on milk diet, and not completely"
starved; on the third day a large quantity of dark clotted
"blood was passed per rectum with the stool, and this continued"
for two days.
Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to
"100°, and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The"
"pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,"
respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the
epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.
"Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric"
"pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,"
and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The
"spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the"
lower margin of the right lung.
"(164*) Wounded at Enslin. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from"
"the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; _exit_,"
"through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the"
median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when
"shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times"
"before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion"
them--and with the informality of adversity the three captives began
to talk. Swiftly Brand got a little knowledge of Greca's position on
"Jupiter, and of the racial history that led up to it."
*       *       *       *       *
Four of the nine satellites of Jupiter were now the home of living
"beings. But two only, at the dawn of history as Greca knew it, had"
been originally inhabited. These were the fourth and the second.
"On the fourth there dwelt a race, ""like me,"" as Greca put it--a"
"kindly, gentle people content to live and let live."
"On the second had been a race of immensely tall, but attenuated and"
physically feeble things with great heads and huge dull eyes and
characters distinguished mainly for cold-blooded savagery.
The inhabitants of the fourth satellite had remained in ignorance of
"the monsters on the second till one day ""many, many ages ago,"" a fleet"
of clumsy ships appeared on the fourth satellite. From the ships had
"poured thousands of pipe-like creatures, armed with horrible rods of"
"metal that killed instantly and without a sound. The things, it"
"seemed, had crowded over the limits of their own globe, and had been"
forced to find more territory.
They had made captive the entire population of the satellite.
Then--for like all dangerous vermin they multiplied rapidly--they had
overflowed to the first and fifth satellites--the others were
uninhabitable--and finally to the dangerous surface of Jupiter itself.
"Everywhere they had gone, they had taken droves of Greca's people to"
"be their slaves, ""and the source of their food,"" added Greca, with a"
shudder; a statement that was at the moment unintelligible to the two
"""I suppose I had better introduce myself to you, Mr. Alwyn""--she said"
"with a condescending and confident air--""Though really we know each"
other so well by reputation that there seems scarcely any necessity for
"it! Of course you have heard of 'Tiger-Lily!'"""
"Villiers gazed at her helplessly,--he had never felt so uncomfortable"
"in all his life. Here was a strange woman, who had actually taken"
"bodily possession of his apartment as though it were her own,--who had"
"settled herself down in his particular pet Louis Quatorze chair,--who"
stared at him with the scrutinizing complacency of a professional
"physiognomist,--and who seemed to think no explanation of her"
"extraordinary conduct was necessary, inasmuch as ""of course"" he,"
"Villiers, had heard of ""TIGER-LILY!"" It was very singular! ... almost"
like madness! ... Perhaps she WAS mad! How could he tell? She had a
"remarkably high, knobby brow,--a brow with an unpleasantly bald"
"appearance, owing to the uncompromising way in which her hair was"
brushed well off it--he had seen such brows before in certain
"""spiritualists"" who believed, or pretended to believe, in the suddenly"
"willed dematerialization of matter, and THEY were mad, he knew, or else"
very foolishly feigning madness!
"Endeavoring to compose his bewildered mind, he fixed glass in eye, and"
"regarded her through it with an inquiring solemnity,--he would have"
"spoken, but before he could utter a word, she went on rapidly:"
"""You are not in the least like the person I imagined you to be! ..."
"However, that doesn't matter. Literary celebrities are always so"
"different to what we expect!"""
"""Pardon me, madam,""--began Villiers politely.. ""You are making a slight"
"error,--my servant probably did not explain. I am not Mr. Alwyn, . . my"
and Gaspard bade him good-night in a cheery voice as they passed him.
The doorkeeper stood and watched the pair for a minute as they left the
Square and turned down a narrow street which led to the poorer part of
"the town, and thence to the quays. He heard Gaspard's high-pitched voice"
"and shrill laughter, and, in answer, Benham's thick tones and heavy"
"shout of drunken mirth. Once or twice these sounds repeated themselves,"
then they ceased; the footsteps of the Frenchman and his companion died
"away in the distance. The doorkeeper went on his way, thinking with"
"relief that Mr. Gaspard, for all his tall talk, was more at home with a"
bottle than with a knife or a bomb.
"Notwithstanding his dissipation, Gaspard was afoot very early in the"
"morning. It was hardly light, and the deep scratch of finger-nails on"
his face--it is so awkward when drunken fools wake at the wrong
minute--attracted no attention from the few people he encountered. He
"did not give them long to look at him, for he hurried swiftly through"
"the streets, towards the quays where the ships lay loading their"
"cargoes. He seemed to have urgent business to transact down there,"
"business that would brook no delay, and that was, if one might guess"
"from his uneasy glances over his shoulder, of a private nature. With one"
"hand he held tight hold of something in his trousers pocket, the other"
"rested on his belt, hard by a little revolver. In his business it is"
necessary to be ready for everything.
"Meanwhile Mr. Benham, having no affairs to trouble him, and no more"
"business to transact, stayed where he was."
CHAPTER XIX.
"Perhaps, after all, my jealousy might have been utterly unfounded."
"Sometimes I had thought I had treated her harshly, for, truth to tell, I"
had never obtained absolute proof that this man was more than a mere
"acquaintance.  Indeed, I think it was this fact, or just a slight twinge"
"of conscience, that caused a suspicion of the old love I once bore her"
to remain within me.  It was not just to Edith--that I knew; yet
"notwithstanding the denunciations of both Kaye and Anderson, I could not"
altogether crush her from my heart.  To wholly forget the woman for whom
"one has entertained the grand passion is often most difficult,"
"sometimes, indeed, impossible of accomplishment.  Visions of some sweet"
"face with its pouting and ready lips will arise, constantly keeping the"
"past ever present, and recalling a day one would fain forget.  Thus it"
was with me--just as it has been with thousands of others.
"""No,"" I admitted truthfully and honestly at last, ""my love for Yolande"
"is perhaps not altogether dead."""
"""Then you will render me a service?"" she cried quickly.  ""Say that you"
"will--for her sake!--for the sake of the great love you once bore her!"""
"""Of what nature is this service you desire?""  I asked, determined to act"
"with caution, for the startling stories I had heard had aroused within"
me considerable suspicion.
"""I desire your silence regarding an absolute secret,"" she answered in a"
hoarse half-whisper.
"""What secret?"""
"""A secret concerning Yolande,"" she responded.  ""Will you, for her sake,"
"render us assistance, and at the same time preserve absolute secrecy as"
"to what you may see or learn here to-day?"""
"composed himself to sleep, his chest rising and falling with regular,"
"uninterrupted breathing. Once he smiled: he was thinking of Ned Evans,"
"the doorkeeper; then he gave himself a little shake, closed his eyes,"
"and forgot all the troubles of this weary world. So sleep children,"
"so--we are told--the just: so slept M. François Gaspard, on his way to"
seek fresh woods and pastures new.
CHAPTER XXI.
ALL THERE WAS TO TELL.
The custom in New Lindsey was that every Monday during the session of
"Parliament the Executive Council should meet at Government House, and,"
"under the presidency of the Governor, formally ratify and adopt the"
arrangements as to the business of the coming week which its members had
"decided upon at their Cabinet meetings. It is to be hoped that, in these"
"days, when we all take an interest in our Empire, everybody knows that"
"the Executive Council is the outward, visible, and recognised form of"
"that impalpable, unrecognised, all-powerful institution, the Cabinet,"
"consisting in fact, though not in theory, of the same persons, save that"
"the Governor is present when the meeting is of the Council, and absent"
"when it is of the Cabinet--a difference of less moment than it sounds,"
"seeing that, except in extreme cases, the Governor has little to do but"
"listen to what is going to be done. However, forms doubtless have their"
"value, and at any rate they must be observed, so on this Monday morning"
"the Executive Council was to meet as usual, although nobody knew where"
"the Cabinet would be that time twenty-four hours. Lady Eynesford, who"
"wanted her husband to drive her out, thought the meeting under the"
of gloom. Stars flickered in the heavens; the moon came and enveloped
the trees with silver flame. A primeval calm lay heavy upon the bosom
of the night. The spectral branches of the trees pointed rigid and
motionless towards the sky.
Francesco had left the duke gazing out upon the shimmering sea. The
voice called to him from the woods with plaintive peals of song. The
"man followed it, holding to a grass-grown track that curled at random"
into the gloom. Moonlight and shadow lay alternate upon his armor.
Hope and despair battled in his face. His soul leaped voiceless and
inarticulate into the darkened shrine of prayer.
The voice came to him clearer in the forest calm. The gulf had
"narrowed, the words flew as over the waters of Death. They were pure,"
"yet meaningless, passionate, yet void; words barbed with an utter"
"pathos, that silenced desire."
"For an hour Francesco roamed in the woods, drawing ever nearer, the"
fear in him increasing with every step. Anon the voice failed him by a
little stream that quivered dimly through the grass. A stillness that
was ghostly held the woods. The moonlight seemed to shudder on the
trees. A stupendous silence weighed upon the world.
"A hollow glade opened suddenly in the woods, a white gulf in a forest"
"gloom. Water shone there, a mere rush-ringed and full of mysterious"
"shadows, girded by the bronzed foliage of a thousand oaks. Moss grew"
"thick about the roots, dead leaves covered the grass."
"And ever and anon a dead leaf dropped silently to earth, like a hope"
that has died on the Tree of Life.
Francesco knelt in a patch of bracken and looked out over the glades.
"countrymen in South Africa, there stood up a man himself nurtured in"
"luxury, to take up the burden of the disinherited. His wife too stood by"
"him, a lady of gentle birth. We all know who that man is--he is"
"Gandhi,--and what humiliations and suffering he went through. Do you"
think he suffered in vain and that his voice remained unheard? It was
"not so, for in the great vortex of passion for Justice, there were"
caught others--men like Polak and Andrews. Are they your countrymen? Not
"in the narrow sense of the word but truly in a larger sense, that these"
who choose to bear and suffer belong to one clan the clan from which
Kshatriya Chivalry is recruited. The removal of suffering and of the
cause of suffering is the Dharma of the strong Kshatriya. The earth is
the wide and universal theatre of man's woeful pageant. The question is
who is to suffer more than his share. Is the burden to fall on the weak
or the strong? Is it to be under hopeless compulsion or of voluntary
acceptance?
DEFENCE OF HOMELAND
In your services for your country there is no higher at the present
moment than to ensure for her security and peace. We have so long
enjoyed the security of peace without being called upon to maintain it.
But this is no longer so.
At no time within the recent history of India has there been so quick a
readjustment and appreciation as regards proper understanding of the
aspiration of the Indian people. This has been due to what India has
been able to offer not merely in the regions of thought but also in the
fields of battle.
MASS RESPONSE
burst into a roar of laughter. For the moment the _gamin_ in him was
uppermost--the same curly-pated rascal who had climbed walls and stolen
apples from the market-women's stalls of Tortosa thirty years ago.
"""You are a brave fellow,"" cried the general, ""and I would to Heaven that"
your royal cousin had more of your spirit. Are all of your company of
"the same warlike kidney?"""
"""I trust I am afraid of no man on the field of honour,"" answered the"
"loyal little Frenchman, throwing out his chest. ""Yet I speak but the"
truth when I aver that there is not one of my companions who could not
"say grace and eat me up afterwards!"""
Among the letters which had formed part of Rollo's credentials there was
"one superscribed ""_To be opened in the camp of General Cabrera_."""
"Cabrera now dismissed the firing party with a wave of his hand, the"
officer in command exchanging an encouraging nod with Rollo. Then he
summoned that young man to approach. Rollo threw away the last inch of
"his cigarette, and going up easily, saluted the general with his usual"
self-possession.
"""Well, colonel,"" said the latter, ""I little thought to exchange"
civilities with you again; but for that you have to thank this young
lady. The fortune of war once more! But if young men will entrust
"precious papers to pretty girls, they must have a fund of gratitude upon"
"which to draw--that is, when the ladies arrive in time. On this occasion"
it was most exactly done. Yet you must have lived through some very
"crowded moments while you faced the muzzles of yonder rifles!"""
And he pointed to the lane down which the firing party was defiling.
"law, and indeed _called_ 'mares' in certain counties where genuine old"
"English law is still preserved.""--Borrow."
"3. ""Contempt for woman, _the result of clerical teaching_, is shown in"
"myriad forms.""--Gage."
"4. ""The legal subordination of one sex to another is wrong in itself,"
"_and is now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement_.""--John"
Stuart Mill.
"5. ""I have no relish for a community of goods resting on the doctrine,"
"that what is mine is yours, but what is yours is not mine; and I should"
"prefer to decline entering into such a compact with anyone, _though I"
"were myself_ the person to profit by it.""--Ibid."
It will take a long time for that sort of morality to filter into the
"skull of the Church, and when it does the skull will burst."
"6. ""Certain beliefs have been inculcated, certain crimes invented, in"
order to intimidate the masses. Hence the Church made free thought the
"worst of sins, and the spirit of inquiry the worst of blasphemies.... As"
late as the time of Bunyan the chief doctrine inculcated from the pulpit
was obedience to the temporal power.... All these influences fell with
"crushing weight on woman.""--_Matilda Joslyn Gage_ in ""Hist. Woman"
"Suffrage."""
"7. ""Taught that education for her was indelicate and irreligious, she"
"has been kept in such gross ignorance as to fall a prey to superstition,"
and to glory in her own degradation... Such was the prejudice against a
"liberal education for woman, that the first public examination of a girl"
in geometry (1829) created as bitter a storm of ridicule as has since
"assailed women who have entered the law, the pulpit, or the medical"
"""It is hardly worth while to begin now,"" Beatrice observed, and this"
simple acknowledgment that the end was at hand received no
contradiction.
"Once again the silence was unbroken, save for the soft swish of the"
"fan and Mrs. Cary's heavy, irregular breathing. Yet the five women who"
in the full swing of their life had been diametrically opposed to one
"another were now united in a common sympathy. Death, far more than a"
"leveler of class, is the melting-pot into which are thrown all"
"antagonisms, all violent discords of character. The one great fact"
"overshadows everything, and the petty stumbling-blocks of daily life"
are forgotten. More than that still--it is the supreme moment in man's
existence when the innermost treasures or unsuspected hells are
"revealed beyond all denial. And in these five women, hidden in two"
"cases at least beneath a mass of meanness, selfishness and"
"indifference, there lay an unusual power of self-sacrifice and pity."
"Death was drawing near to them all, and their one thought was how to"
make his coming easier for the other. When the silence grew
"unbearable, it was Mrs. Carmichael who had the courage to break it"
with a trivial criticism respecting the manner in which Lois was
making the sandwiches.
"""You should put the butter on before you cut them,"" she said tartly,"
"""and as little as possible. I'm quite sure it has gone rancid, and"
"then George won't touch them. He is so fussy about the butter."""
Mrs. Berry looked up. The perspiration of physical fear stood on her
"cold forehead, but her roused will-power fought heroically and"
conquered.
"""And, please, would you mind making one or two without butter?"" she"
THE CREW OF THE _KAMMA FUNDER_.
"The stars of European science, who had been shining in a wonderful"
"constellation over Quebec, were just about to leave Canada in that"
"well-known comfortable liner, the _Nipigon_, when a most annoying"
"thing happened.  The cattle-ship _Abbitibbe_, never famous at any"
"time for minding her helm, got her steam steering gear jammed as she"
"was passing the _Nipigon_, and took a wide sheer to port when she"
should have altered her course to starboard.  The peaceful
"preparations of the passenger boat were broken up, and her crew"
"received the wild charge of the _Abbitibbe_ with curses, which,"
"though effectual in heating the atmosphere, were no use as a fender."
"The _Nipigon_ was cut down to the water's edge, and the scientific"
lights of Europe were much put out.  They hurried ashore in the most
"irregular and unscientific manner, and, having sent others for their"
"baggage, began to make preparations for going to New York, as no"
other good passenger boat was leaving the St. Lawrence for a week.
"But Nature, possibly out of revenge for the unseemly curiosity"
"evinced by all men of science, was beforehand with them."
"Misfortunes, as was once observed by an intelligent, if pessimistic,"
"anthropoid ape, never come singly.  It was the twelfth of November,"
"and a sudden blizzard, bringing all the snow it could carry, broke up"
communication with the south.  If the men of science were to keep
"their appointments with their universities, it was necessary to sail"
from Canada at once.  They shipped themselves under protest upon the
"_Nemagosenda_, of 2,900 tons register, which was little better than a"
"tramp, and was commanded by Captain Joseph Prowse."
"prospect at a certain house half a mile up the road where, as they had"
"ridden rapidly by, a couple of pretty girls had looked out curiously at"
the tossing Carlist _boinas_.
Rollo and El Sarria were carrying their scanty provend to a house where
"a decent-looking woman had agreed to cook it for them, when their gloomy"
reveries were interrupted by a sudden apparition which burst upon them
as they stood on the crest of a deep hollow.
"The limestone hills had been rent asunder at the place, and from the"
bare faces of the rocks the neighbouring farmers and villagers had
quarried and carried away such of the overhanging blocks as could easily
be trimmed to suit their purposes.
"Part of what remained had been shaped into a _hornito_, or stone oven,"
"under which a fire had been kindled, and a strange figure moved about,"
stirring the glowing charcoal with a long bar of iron. On a smaller
"hearth nearer at hand a second fire blazed, and the smell of fragrant"
cookery rose to the expectant and envious nostrils of the four.
"It was Sergeant Cardono, who moved about whistling softly, now attending"
"to the steaming _olla_, now watching the rising bread in the _hornito_."
"Perceiving Rollo, he saluted gravely and remarked, ""Dinner will be"
"served in half an hour."" The others, as before, he simply ignored. But"
in deference to his new commander he stopped whistling and moved about
with his lean shoulders squared as if on parade.
"When the bread and the skinny chicken were placed in his hands, he"
glanced at them with somewhat of superciliousness.
"""The bread will serve for crumbs,"" he said, and immediately began to"
"together apart like old friends. John Mortimer and Etienne, who"
"generally had little to say to each other, conversed freely upon"
wine-growing and the possibility of introducing cotton-spinning into the
South of France. For Etienne was not destitute of a certain Gascon eye
to the main chance.
Rollo alone rode gloomily apart. He was turning over the terms of his
"commission in his mind, and the more he thought, the less was he"
satisfied. It was not alone the desperateness of the venture that
"daunted Rollo, but the difficulty of providing for the Queen-Regent and"
little princess when captured. There were a couple of hundred miles to
ride back to those northern fastnesses where they would be safe; for the
most part without cover and through country swarming with Nationals and
Cristino partisans.
"Riding thus in deep meditation, Rollo, whose gaze was usually so alert,"
did not observe away to the right a couple of horses ridden at speed and
rapidly overtaking their more tired beasts.
"El Sarria, however, did not fail to note them, but, fearing a belated"
"message of recall from General Cabrera, he did not communicate his"
"discovery to his companions, contenting himself with keeping his eye"
upon the approaching riders.
"Rollo was therefore still advancing, his reins flung loosely upon his"
"beast's neck and his whole attitude betokening a melancholy resignation,"
"a couple of lengths before his companions, when a sudden clattering of"
"hoofs startled him. He looked up, and there, on her white mare,"
"well-lathered at girth and bridle, was little Concha Cabezos, sitting"
her panting beast with the grace of the true Andaluse.
Her hair was a little ruffled by the wind. Her cheeks and lips were
"Isthmus, and even a request from the chief that the war vessel that"
brought the negotiator on his fruitless errand should leave was acceded
"to. It is quite unlikely, however, that the Indians will be able to"
maintain their isolation much longer. Already there are signs of its
breaking down. While I was in Panama they sent a request that a
"missionary, a woman it is true, who had been much among them, should"
come and live with them permanently. They also expressed a desire that
"she should bring her melodeon, thus giving new illustration to the"
"poetic adage, “Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast”. Perhaps"
the phonograph may in time prove the open sesame to many savage bosoms.
Among this people it is the women who cling most tenaciously to the
"primitive customs, as might be expected, since they have been so"
assiduously guarded against the wiles of the world. But Catholic
"missionaries have made some headway in the country, and at Narganá"
schools for girls have been opened under auspices of the church. It is
probably due to the feminine influence that the San Blas men return so
unfailingly to primitive customs after the voyages that have made them
familiar with civilization. If the women yield to the desire for novelty
the splendid isolation of the San Blas will not long endure. Perhaps
"that would be unfortunate, for all other primitive peoples who have"
surrendered to the wiles of the white men have suffered and disappeared.

three lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There
"are also three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield,"
"and between the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct"
and unconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of
"large, crescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The"
"eye varies greatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from"
fourteen in some species to fifteen thousand in others. Figure

During the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.
"Again and again new species and genera appeared, while the older"
types became extinct. For this reason and because of their
"abundance, trilobites are used in the classification of the"
Cambrian system. The Lower Cambrian is characterized by the
presence of a trilobitic fauna in which the genus Olenellus is
"predominant. This, the OLENELLUS ZONE, is one of the most"
"important platforms in the entire geological series; for, the"

Cambrian by the genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were
"giants, measuring as much as two feet long, while others were the"
"smallest of their kind, a fraction of an inch in length."
Another type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose
order is still living is illustrated in Figure 269.

"Francesco smote one brute through with his spear, as it was feeding in"
the gutter on the carcass of a child. In the market square the
Provencals had made such another massacre as they had perpetrated in
Alba. The horrible obscenity of the scene struck the duke's men dumb
"as the dead. The towns-folk had been stripped, bound face to face,"
left slain in many a hideous and ribald pose. The vultures' beaks had
emulated the sword. The stench from the place was as the breath of a
"charnel house, and the duke and his men turned back with grim faces"
from the brutal silence of that ghastly town.
"Near one of the gates a wild, tattered figure darted out from a"
"half-wrecked house, stood blinking at them in the sun, then sped away,"
"screaming and whimpering at the sight of the duke, as though possessed"
"with a demon. It was a woman, still retaining the traces of her former"
"great beauty, gone mad, yet the only live thing they found in the"
town.
"The duke had reined in his steed at the sight, gone white to the roots"
"of his hair. Then he covered his face with his hands, and Francesco"
heard him utter a heart-rending moan.
"When his hands fell, after a lapse of time, he seemed to have aged"
years in this brief space.
"""Forward, my men,"" he shouted with iron mouth. ""The Frangipani shall"
"not complain of our swords!"""

"Above all, he did not want Alice to emerge from this moment of personal"

"Hourly, after the coded signals came in, Ted Wilson took the microphone"
himself and called out into space in the infrawave. He called messages
"of hope, and explained how many spacecraft were scouring the deep black"
"void. He could only pray that he would be heard, that his voice would"
give Alice some firm foundation for hope.
He could not be sure the passengers from the wrecked spaceship even had
"their receivers turned on, because infrawave receivers drink up a lot"
of power and lifeships are not equipped with any vast reserve. There
just was not the room in a lifeship for anything more than the bare
necessities of living.
"The search grid was a truncated cone, and the whitened areas of"
finished search had finally filled the smaller end of the cone. There
"was the flared skirt of the cone yet to be combed, and this provided"
more volume than the cylinder taken out of the middle. It also provided
"a shorter search path as the searching spacecraft built out the volume,"
ring after ring around the first pass along the line of flight.
"Far, far to one side a detector registered, and brought every man"
in the fleet to the alert. Then they relaxed unhappily again as the
scooter returned with another report of a small gas cloud. Wilson
"thought glumly that they had discovered enough space meteors, gas"
"clouds, and unawakened comets to make up a small sun."
Then his attention was taken from his own personal troubles by the
pretending that there is none within the palace. As if a Queen of Spain
"could not have all the milk she wanted! Ridiculous!"""
By this time the little girl had mounted the parapet and was clinging
"with all her might to the iron railings, while a fat motherly person had"
"waddled out of the underbrush in search of her, and with many"
exclamations of pretended anger and indignation was endeavouring to
entice her away.
"But the more the nurse scolded and pulled, the more firmly did the"
"little maid cling to the golden bars. At last the elderly woman, quite"
"out of breath, sat down on the stone ledge and addressed to her charge"
the argument which in such cases betokens unconditional surrender.
"""My lady Isabel, what would your noble and royal mother say,"" she"
"gasped, ""thus to forget all the counsels and commands of those put in"
authority over you and run to the railings to chatter with a gipsy wife?
"Go away, goatherdess, or I will call the attendants and have you put in"

"La Giralda had stopped her flock, obedient to the wishes of the little"
"maid, but now, with a low curtsey to both, she gathered them together"
"with her peculiar whistling cry, and prepared to continue her way down"
into the village.
But this the little girl would in nowise permit. She let go the iron
"rail, and with both hands clenched fell upon her attendant with"
concentrated fury.

"there was no hæmoptysis, but for the succeeding nine days small"
brightish red clots were expectorated. There was some
tenderness over the ribs from the fifth to the ninth in the
"axillary line, and on the ninth day some gravitation ecchymosis"
appeared over the same region. Cough was an early troublesome
"symptom in this case, and when admitted to the Base hospital,"
"about the seventh day, there was evidence of fluid extending"
about a third of the way up the back.
On the tenth day after admission a pleural rub was detected at
"the upper margin of the dulness, and the latter shortly"
extended upwards over a little more than half the back.
"Meanwhile, there was no further hæmoptysis, respiration was"
"fairly easy, 24 per minute, but accompanied by slight"
"dilatation of the alæ nasi, and the temperature, which had been"
"ranging from 99° to 100°, began to rise steadily, on the"
fifteenth day reaching 102.5°. The patient refused even an
"exploratory puncture, and was treated on the expectant plan."
"The temperature slowly subsided, with a steady improvement in"
"the physical signs, and at the end of about ten weeks he left"
for home with only slight dulness and incapacity for active
exertion remaining. (Now again on active service.)

"frequently little scrupulous, they knew how to conclude first small deals,"
"then larger ones, everywhere. Using the special talents of their race to"
"advantage, they succeeded in establishing themselves on all coasts of the"
"Mediterranean, even in {108} Spain.[12] At Malaga an inscription mentions a"
corporation formed by them. The Italian ports where business was especially
"active, Pozzuoli, Ostia, later Naples, attracted them in great numbers. But"
they did not confine themselves to the seashore; they penetrated far into
"the interior of the countries, wherever they hoped to find profitable"
trade. They followed the commercial highways and traveled up the big
"rivers. By way of the Danube they went as far as Pannonia, by way of the"
Rhone they reached Lyons. In Gaul they were especially numerous. In this
new country that had just been opened to commerce fortunes could be made
rapidly. A rescript discovered on the range of the Lebanon is addressed to
"sailors from Arles, who had charge of the transportation of grain, and in"
of his relinquished hopes—and cried aloud profane words of holy
rapture.
"From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy,"
"fluttering, wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy."
"By came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the"
delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks.
"“Will you oblige me with the time, sir?” asked the young man; and the"
"citizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and"
announced:
"“Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.”"
"And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made"
"tenth 103°. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was"
"inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The"
signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of
"consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the"
sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary
artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was
musculo-spiral paralysis.
"After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further"
"operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature"
"commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of"
103.2° on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient
consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.
A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three
"weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the"
"pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,"
"some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the"
chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral
"curvature, being the only remaining signs."

of arousing the compassion of his companion.
"He said not a word about Peggy Ramsay, nor did he mention the broken"

nothing could have been more nunlike and conventual than the expression
with which she listened. It was as if one of the Lady Superior's
"""Holiest Innocents"" had flown over the nunnery wall and settled down to"
listen to Rollo's tale in that wild gorge among the mountains of
Guadarrama.

Meantime the Sergeant and his gipsy companion pursued their way with
little regard to the occupations or sentiments of those they had left
"behind them. Cardono's keen black eyes, twinkling hither and thither, a"
myriad crows' feet reticulating out from their corners like spiders'
"webs, took in the landscape, and every object in it."
"The morning was well advanced when, right across their path, a"
"well-to-do farmhouse lay before them, white on the hillside, its walls"
"long-drawn like fortifications, and the small slit-like windows"
counterfeiting loopholes for musketry. But instead of the hum of work
"and friendly gossip, the crying of ox-drivers yoking their teams, or"
"adjusting the long blue wool over the patient eyes of their beasts,"
"there reigned about the place, both dwelling and office-houses, a"

"salvage as aforesaid to the re-captors, and may enforce payment thereof,"
"either by warrant of arrest against the ship or goods, or in the same"
manner as a judgment of the court in which the proceedings are
instituted may be enforced.

interest in normal stories is difficult to rouse. I will not here dwell
"on the deleterious effects of over dramatic stimulation, which has been"
"known to lead to crime, since I am keener to prevent the telling of too"
many sensational stories than to suggest a cure when the mischief is
done. Kate Douglas Wiggin has said:
"“Let us be realistic, by all means, but beware, O Story-teller, of"
being too realistic. Avoid the shuddering tale of ‘the wicked boy who
"stoned the birds,’ lest some hearer should be inspired to try the"
dreadful experiment and see if it really does kill.”
"I must emphasise the fact, however, that it is only the excess of"
this dramatic element which I deplore. A certain amount of excitement
is necessary; but this question belongs to the positive side of the
"subject, and I shall deal with it later on."
V.--_Stories presenting matters quite outside the plane of the child_
"(unless they are wrapped in mystery, which is of great educational"
value).
The element I wish to eliminate is the one which would make children
world-wise and old before their time.
A small American child who had entertained a guest in her mother's
"absence, when questioned as to whether she had shown all the"
"hospitality the mother would have considered necessary, said: “Oh! yes."
And I talked to her in the kind of ‘dressy’ tone _you_ use on your ‘At
Home’ days.”
"On one occasion I was lecturing in the town of Cleveland, and was to"
"stay in the house of a lady whom I had met only once, in New York, but"
with true American hospitality she had begged me to make her house my
"Huge as a primitive nuclear reactor, the great electronic brain loomed"
above the knot of hush-voiced men. It almost filled a two-story room in
"the Thinkers' Foundation. Its front was an orderly expanse of controls,"
"indicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair"
on a boom.
"Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information"
"and questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not"
resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great
"cryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its"
own controls--the permissible ones--and could doubtless improvise a
hearing apparatus if it wanted to.
For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and
Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.
This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human
"brain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the"
rims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney
Island shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had
given instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This
"was the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased"
human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.
_This was the machine that really thought--a million-plus!_
This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy
professional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the
"machine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push, _had_"
"built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and"
"girl-fondness, ""Maizie."""

"artillery mules!"""
"So saying, he went casually to the edge of the little quarry, whistled a"
"peculiar note and tossed the bird downward to some person unseen, who"
appeared from nowhere in particular for the purpose of receiving it.
When the dinner was ready Sergeant Cardono announced it to Rollo as if
he had been serving a prince. And what was the young man's astonishment
"to find a table, covered with a decent white cloth, under the shelter of"
"a limestone rock, spread for three, and complete even to table napkins,"
which the sergeant had tied into various curious shapes.
"As they filed down the slope the sergeant stood at attention, but when"
El Sarria passed he quickly beckoned him aside with a private gesture.
"""You and I will eat after the foreigners,"" he explained."
"El Sarria drew himself up somewhat proudly, but Sergeant Cardono"
whispered in his ear two or three words which appeared to astonish him
"so much that he did as he was bid, and stood aside while John Mortimer"
and Etienne de Saint Pierre seated themselves.
"But Rollo, who had no great love for eating, and considered one man just"
"as much entitled to respect as another, would not sit down till El"
Sarria was accommodated also.

"other,"" quoth the Sergeant, with great respect, ""besides your honour is"

"with the same abiding calm, he restored the cambric to his pocket, bowed"

Maria Cristina watched him at first with a haughty and unmoved
"countenance. Her hands clenched themselves close to her side, as if she"
wished the blow had been bestowed with the shut rather than with the
open digits.
"But as her husband (for so he really was, though the relationship was"
"not acknowledged till many years after, and at the feet of the Holy"
"Father himself in the Vatican) approached the door, opened it, and was"
"on the point of departing without once turning round, Cristina suddenly"
"broke into a half hysterical cry, ran after him, threw her arms tenderly"
"about his neck, and burst out weeping on his broad bosom."
"The gentleman, without betraying the least emotion, patted her"
"tolerantly on the shoulder, and murmured some words in her ear, at the"
same time looking over her head at the men of the company with a sort of
half-comic apology.
"""Oh! Fernando, forgive me,"" she cried, ""life of my life--the devil must"
have possessed me! I will cut off the wicked hand that did the deed.
"Give me a knife, good people--to strike the best and handsomest--oh, it"
"was wicked--cruel, diabolical!"""
"Whatever may have been the moral qualities of the royal blow, Rollo felt"
that in their present circumstances time enough had been given to its
"consideration, so he interposed."
"""Your Majesty, the gipsies may be upon us at any moment. It would be as"
"The man was placed in a tent by himself, and to my surprise was"
alive and better the next morning; the expression was still
"anxious, but the face brighter and not sweating; the pulse"
"only numbered 100, but was very weak, and the hands and feet"
"were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the"
thoracic respiration had decreased in rapidity from 48 to 28.
His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful
"intervention, but none the less life was retained until the"
"morning of the seventh day, the state alternating between a"
moribund one and one of slight improvement. He was lucid at
"times, although for the most part wandering, and was so"
restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was
"continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the"
"bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine"
"was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an"
area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter
developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the
"pulse, and from normal to subnormal in the temperature, were"
"noted, and death eventually occurred from septicæmia and"
inanition.
"(168*) Wounded at Driefontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), above the"
"posterior third of the left iliac crest, at the margin of the"
last lumbar transverse process (probably through ilio-lumbar
"ligament); _exit_, 1 inch below and to the left of the"
umbilicus.
"The patient was wounded at 3 P.M., but not brought into the"
"Field hospital until 9 P.M., when the temperature of the tents"
"was below 28°F. He was considerably collapsed, suffering much"
"pain, and vomited freely. The abdomen was flat, but very"
"largely, if not entirely, by reason of its reversion to classical"
principles and devices.
"We have insisted on the difference between Tragedy and Pathos, and"
criticized the weakening effect of the latter upon the former. To escape
the penalty that awaits general criticism we may add here that Tragedy
is never greater than when her handmaid is ready to do her _modest_
"service. Sophocles puts into the mouth of Oedipus, at the moment of his"
"departure into blind and desolate exile, tender injunctions regarding"
the care of his young daughters:
"But my poor maidens, hapless and forlorn,"
"Who never had a meal apart from mine,"
"But ever shared my table, yea, for them"
"Take heedful care; and grant me, though but once,"
"Yea, I beseech thee, with these hands to feel,"
"Thou noble heart! the forms I love so well,"
And weep with them our common misery.
"Oh, if my arms were round them, I might seem"
To have them as of old when I could see.[52]
"Shakespeare, too, knew well how to kindle the soft radiance which,"
"fading again, makes the ensuing darkness darker still. Ophelia, the"
"sleeping Duncan, Cordelia rise to our minds. Nor need we quote the"
famous words of Webster's Ferdinand. It is enough that the greatest
scene in _Gorboduc_ is precisely that scene where pathos softens by a
momentary dimness of vision our horror at a mother's crime.
"_The Misfortunes of Arthur_ (1587), by Thomas Hughes, though twenty-five"
"years later, may be placed next to _Gorboduc_ in our discussion of the"
rise of tragedy. It will serve as an illustration of the kind of tragedy
that was being evolved from Senecan models by plodding uninspired
merely repeated what was whispered to her; hence a chat with her was
"always interesting to one who, like myself, was paid to keep his ears"
open and report from time to time the direction of the political wind.
"Tournier, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his wife were her"
most intimate friends; hence she was frequently aware of facts which
"were of considerable importance to us.  Indeed, once or twice her"
friendliness for myself had caused her to drop hints which had been of
the greatest use to Lord Barmouth in the conduct of his difficult
diplomacy at that time when the boulevard journals were screaming
"against England and the filthy prints were caricaturing Her Majesty,"
with intent to insult.  Even the _Figaro_--the moderate organ of the
French Foreign Office--had lost its self-control in the storm of abuse
"following the Fashoda incident, and had libelled and maligned ""les"
"English.""  I therefore seized the opportunity for a chat with the"
"wizen-faced old lady, who seemed in a particularly good-humour, and"
deftly turned the conversation into the political channel.
"""Now, tell me, Baronne,"" I said, after we had been chatting some little"
"time, and I had learnt more than one important fact regarding the"
"intentions of Tournier, ""what is your opinion regarding the occupation"
"of Ceuta?"""
"She glanced at me quickly, as though surprised that I should be aware of"
what she had believed to be an entire secret.
"""Of Ceuta?"" she echoed.  ""And what do you at your Embassy know regarding"
"it?"""
"""We've heard a good deal,"" I laughed."
"""No doubt you've heard a good deal that is untrue,"" the clever old lady"
"the paved floor of the miniature kitchen. Having arrived in which place,"
"her anger completely vanished, for a tankardful of rich warm goat's milk"
"was handed to her by La Giralda, and in this flowing bowl she soon"
forgot her woes.
"""You must come down to the palace and be paid,"" said the little girl;"
"""we are most of us very hungry there, and those who are not hungry are"
"thirsty. The waggons from Madrid have been stopped on the way, and all"
"the guards have gone to bring them back!"""
At this Doña Susana looked quickly across to the old goatherdess and
signalled that the little Princess was not to be informed of anything
she might happen to know.
"""You have not been in the town, I trust!"" said Doña Susana."
Now La Giralda could conscientiously have declared that she had never
"been within the gates of San Ildefonso in her life, but thinking that in"
"the circumstances the statement might appear a suspicious one, she"
modified it to a solemn declaration that she had come directly down from
"her farm on the mountain-side, as, indeed, they themselves had seen."
"Satisfied of her veracity, Doña Susana took her very independent and"
difficult charge by the hand and led the way towards the palace of La
"Granja, glimpses of which could be obtained through the foliage which"
was still everywhere verdant and abundant with the first freshness of
"spring--so high did the castle lie on the hill-slopes, and so enlivening"
"were the waste waters downthrown from the rocky crests of Peñalara,"
"whose snows glimmered through the trees, as it seemed, but a bowshot"
above their heads.
"The goats, each expecting their turn of milking, followed at her heels"
The stereo pattern in the Information Center of Commodore Ted Wilson's
flagship was slowly being filled with the hazy white that indicated
"that these volumes had been combed carefully. As he watched, he could"
"see how the search was progressing, and it was painfully obvious that"
the search was not going good at all.
The flights of spacecraft in set patterns back and forth through the
stereo had covered nearly all of the truncated space cone. The random
search ships were slowly cutting secondary lines through the regions
already covered. There was a green sphere combing the stereo pattern
"now, indicating the new infrawave detector ship and its expected volume"
of detector coverage.
Space was filled to overflowing with the fast patter of the
"communications officers, using infrawave for talks between flights, and"
ordinary radio for talks between ships of the same flight.
Wilson had appointed Chief Communications Officer Haggerty to police
"the bands. Haggerty had done a fine job, removing the howling confusion"
and interference caused from too many calls on the same channel. But
the result was still a high degree of constant call and reply and
"cross talk. Most of the chatter came from the infrawave detector ship,"
sending the scout craft flitting hither and thither on the trail of
spurious responses.
It was almost impossible to grasp the extent of the operation. Only in
"the stereo pattern could anybody begin to follow the complex operation,"
and those who watched the stereo knew that their pattern was only an
idealized space map of what they hoped was going on.
It was worse than combing the area of an ocean from maps that contained
a neat grid of cross rules. Much worse. For the uncharted ocean is
geologists.
THE ALGONKIAN
In some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an
"immense body of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even"
"scores of thousands of feet thick, known as the ALGONKIAN. Great"
"unconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only"
the scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its
"strata, it is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of"
different regions and to give them names of more than local
application. We will describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical
areas.
THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO. We have already studied a very
ancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls
of the Colorado Canyon. The formation of flat-lying sandstone
which covers this buried land surface is proved by its fossils to
"belong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the Paleozoic era."
The tilted rocks on whose upturned edges the Cambrian sandstone
"rests are far older, for the physical break which separates them"
from it records a time interval during which they were upheaved to
mountainous ridges and worn down to a low plain. They are
therefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two immense
series. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and
consists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated
"from it by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207,"
"the lower division, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of"
massive reddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava
interbedded. The lowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of
pebbles derived from the erosion of the dark crumpled schists
"beneath,--schists which are supposed to be Archean. As shown in"
"rejected. Generally, it was against the regulations and, particularly,"
it was injudicious. Down pillows would not be a factor in Unity Blake's
after-life.
"“Besides,” she remarked, “she is not the only orphan in the infirmary.”"
“Why not call it a sick-room or sick-ward instead of that prison term?”
asked John.
"“It's the name given to it by the governing body,” she replied."
After this John became a regular visitor. Every time he kicked his heels
for ten minutes in the shabby and depressing parlour and every time he
was received with glacial politeness by the Sister superintendent.
By blunt questioning he learned the history of the institution. The
Sisterhood of Saint Martha was an Angelican body with headquarters in
"Kent, which existed for meditation and not for philanthropic purposes."
The creation and conduct of the orphanage had been thrust upon the
sisterhood by the will of a member long since deceased. It was unpopular
"with the sisterhood, who resented it as an excrescence, but bore it as"
an affliction decreed by divine Providence. Among the cloistered inmates
of the Kentish manor-house there was no fanatical impulse towards
Willesden.
"They were good, religious women; but they craved retirement, and not"
"action, for the satisfying of their spiritual needs. Otherwise they"
would have joined some other sisterhood in which noble lives are spent
"in deeds of charity and love. But there are angels of wrath, angels of"
"mercy, and mere angels. These were mere angels. The possibility of being"
chosen by the Mother Superior to go out into the world again and take
"charge of the education, health, and morals of twenty sturdy and squalid"
little female orphans lived an abiding terror in their gentle breasts. A
"rear with scales. The vertebrae were not ossified, for no trace of"
them has been found.
DEVONIAN FISHES. The TRUE FISHES of the Devonian can best be
understood by reference to their descendants now living. Modern
fishes are divided into several groups: SHARKS and their allies;
"DIPNOANS; GANOIDS, such as the sturgeon and gar; and TELEOSTS,--"
"most common fishes, such as the perch and cod."
SHARKS. Of all groups of living fishes the sharks are the oldest
and still retain most fully the embryonic characters of their
Paleozoic ancestors. Such characters are the cartilaginous
"skeleton, and the separate gill slits with which the throat wall"
is pierced and which are arranged in line like the gill openings
of the lamprey. The sharks of the Silurian and Devonian are known
"to us chiefly by their teeth and fin spines, for they were"
"unprotected by scales or plates, and were devoid of a bony"
skeleton. Figure 299 is a restoration of an archaic shark from a
somewhat higher horizon. Note the seven gill slits and the
lappetlike paired fins. These fins seem to be remnants of the
"continuous fold of skin which, as embryology teaches, passed from"
fore to aft down each side of the primitive vertebrate.
Devonian sharks were comparatively small. They had not evolved
into the ferocious monsters which were later to be masters of the
seas.
"DIPNOANS, OR LUNG FISHES. These are represented to-day by a"
few peculiar fishes and are distinguished by some high structures
which ally them with amphibians. An air sac with cellular spaces
is connected with the gullet and serves as a rudimentary lung. It
"corresponds with the swim bladder of most modern fishes, and"
"sold or ordered, are blessed and enriched with the indulgences of the"
Rosary Confraternity and the papal blessing. When blessed they may be
"distributed; _but if resold they lose all the indulgences_."" (Italics"
ours.)
Still another relic of great interest in this convent of St. Sabina
"is the crucifix of Michele Ghislieri (afterwards Pope Pius V.). ""One"
"day, as Ghislieri was about to kiss his crucifix, in the eagerness"
"of prayer, the image of Christ, says the legend, retired of its own"
"accord from his touch, for it had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss"
"would have been death."""
"[Sidenote: Sundry Miracles by Other Saints, and Images.]"
"In the Church of St. Gregory, on the C[oe]lian Hill, the thing that"
"interested us most was the picture by Badalocchi, ""commemorating a"
"miracle on this spot, when, at the moment of elevation, the Host"
"is said to have bled in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince an"
"unbeliever of the truth of transubstantiation."" This is the same"
Gregory who presented certain foreign ambassadors with a handful of
"earth from the arena of the Coliseum as a relic for their sovereigns,"
"so many martyrs having suffered death there, and ""upon their receiving"
"the gift with disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed from the"
"soil."""
Not far from the Church of St. Gregory we were shown the hermitage
"where St. Giovanni de Matha lived. ""Before he came to reside here he"
had been miraculously brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a
"mission) to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he knelt"
"without ceasing before the crucifix throughout the whole of his voyage!"""
Time would fail me to tell of the miraculous surgical operation
"interior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier"
"Cambrian time the central land subsided, with much the same effect"
"as if the Mississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the"
Gulf of Mexico to spread northward until it entered Lake Superior.
The Cambrian seas transgressed the central land and strewed far
and wide behind their advancing beaches the sediments of the later
Cambrian upon an eroded surface of pre-Cambrian rocks.
The succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records
many minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical
geography; yet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering
lands. Basal conglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have
"been laid near shore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy"
"shales, and shales. Toward the top of the series heavy beds of"
"limestone, extending from the Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of"
"clear water, and either of more distant shores or of neighboring"
lands which were worn or sunk so low that for the most part their
waste was carried to the sea in solution.
"In brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with"
the larger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It
closed with most of the interior of the continental plateau
covered with a shallow sea.
THE LIFE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD
It is now for the first time that we find preserved in the
offshore deposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal
life to be properly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are
"only the most fragmentary representation of the life of the time,"
for the Cambrian rocks are very old and have been widely
metamorphosed. Yet the five hundred and more species already
"hollow beneath Segovia. Others, breaking up into parties of from a dozen"
"to a hundred, had betaken themselves over the mountains in the direction"
of Madrid.
So the Queen-Regent and the handsome Señor Muñoz remained perforce at La
"Granja, for the two-fold reason that the palace of Madrid was reported"
"to be in the hands of a rebellious mob, and that the disbanding troops"
"had removed with them every sort and kind of conveyance, robbed the"
"stables of the horses, and plundered the military armoury of every"
useful weapon.
"They had not, however, meddled with the treasures of the palace, nor"
"offered any indignity to the Queen-Regent, or to any of the inmates of"
"La Granja. But as the Sergeant well knew, not thus would these be"
"treated by the roving bands of gipsies, who in a few hours would be"
"storming about the defenceless walls. No resource of oriental torture,"
no refinement of barbarity would be omitted to compel the Queen and her
consort to give up the treasures without which it was well known that
"they never travelled. Obviously, therefore, there was no time to be"
lost.
"They went swiftly round the angle of the palace, their feet making no"
sound on the clean delicious sward of those lawns which make the place
"such a marvel in the midst of tawny, dusty, burnt-up Spain. In a brief"
space the party arrived unnoted and unchecked under the wall of the
northern part.
"Lights still burnt in two or three windows on the second floor, though"
all was dark on the face which the palace turned towards the south and
the town of San Ildefonso.
"""These are the windows of the rooms occupied by my lady the"
The localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite
"characteristic of this form of injury, and is a valuable aid to finding"
the openings during an operation.
"Fig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It"
"shows the localised ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here"
rather more extensive from the fact that the blood spreads more readily
in the submucous tissue.
[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Perforating Wounds of Small Intestine. A.
Entry; note circular outline and eversion of mucous membrane. B. Wound
"of exit; curved slit-like character, eversion of mucous membrane. Note"
"the localised ecchymosis, more abundant round exit aperture. (St."
Thomas's Hospital Museum)]
It will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the
regular outline and the small size of the wounds. Another feature not
illustrated by the figures should also be mentioned. In the ruptures of
intestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in
the gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the
"bowel, but in these injuries it was just as frequently at the mesenteric"
"margin. The importance of this factor is considerable, since wounds"
near the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by
"hæmorrhage, and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is"
"considerably multiplied, to say nothing of the danger from loss of"
blood.
"Beyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were"
occasionally cut. I saw instances of these in the case of the ascending
"colon, and in the small curvature of the stomach. The comparative fixity"
of the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance in the
production of this form of injury.
has been unbroken since its beginning.
5. THE CHANGE IN SPECIES HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DIFFERENTIATION.
Tracing the lines of descent of various animals and plants of the
"present backward through the divisions of geologic time, we find"
that these lines of descent converge and unite in simpler and
still simpler types. The development of life may be represented by
a tree whose trunk is found in the earliest ages and whose
branches spread and subdivide to the growing twigs of present
species.
6. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME HAS BEEN A
PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. In the earliest ages the only animals and
"plants on the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in"
structure; while succeeding ages have been characterized by the
"introduction of types more and more specialized and complex, and"
therefore of higher rank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian
contains the remains of only the humblest forms of the
"invertebrates. In the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian the"
invertebrates were represented in all their subkingdoms by a
"varied fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the lowest of the"
vertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their entry on the
"stage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the world in"
the Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange forms
which became more and more like those of the present as the long
ages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest
"product of the creative process, man."
"Just as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so"
"gradual, progressive change, or evolution, has characterized the"
history of life upon the planet. The evolution of the organic
kingdom from its primitive germinal forms to the complex and
"enlarged, the stall of the enemy will be diminished."
"If the outside of the right ear is destroyed, the land will yield to"
the enemy's land.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the cheek[58], the enemy"
"will prevail against the power of the king, the king will be without"
"counsellors, a ruler will not inhabit the land, or the son of the"
king of universal sway[59] will be king.
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the cheek, an enemy will be"
installed in the royal palace.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a"
"demon[60] in my land, or in the house of the man[61]."
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a demon in"
"the enemy's land, or the land of the enemy will perish."
The guiding principle of the interpretation in these instances is the
natural association of the right as your side and the left with the
"enemy's side. A defect on the right side is unfavorable to you, i. e., to"
the king or to the country or to the individual in whose household the
"birth occurs, while the same defect on the left side is unfavorable to the"
"enemy and, therefore, favorable to you. The principle is quite"
consistently carried out even to the point that if the sign itself is
"favorable, it is only when it is found on the right side that it is"
"favorable to you, while its occurrence on the left side is favorable to"
the enemy.
"Defects of any kind appear to be unfavorable, whereas an excess of organs"
"and parts are in many instances favorable, though with a considerable"
"""Yes, and I own everything in the village,"" asserted the imp. ""If you"
"want anything here you must pay me for it!"""
The Sergeant found it even as the cripple had said. There was not a
single living inhabitant in the village. Here and there a shut door and
a sickening smell betrayed the fact that some unfortunates had been left
to die untended. Etienne and John Mortimer were for different reasons
"unwilling to taste of the ham and bread he had brought back, thinking"
"that these might convey the contagion, but La Giralda and the Sergeant"
"laughed their fears to scorn, and together retired to prepare the"
evening meal.
"As the others made their preparations for the night, watering their"
"beasts and grooming them with the utmost care, the little crook-backed"
"imp from the village appeared on the brink of the _barranco_, his"
"sallow, weazened face peeping suspiciously out of the underbrush, and"
his crutch performing the most curious evolutions in the air.
There was something unspeakably eerie in the aspect of the solitary
"survivor of so many living people, left behind to prey like a ghoul on"
the abandoned possessions of the fear-stricken living and the
untestamented property of the dead.
"Concha shrank instinctively from his approach, and the boy, perceiving"
"his power over her, came scuttling like a weasel through the brushwood,"
till little more than a couple of paces interposed between him and the
"girl. Frozen stiff with loathing and terror, it was not for some time"
"that Concha could cry out and look round hastily for Rollo, who"
(doubtless in his capacity of leader of the expedition) was not slow in
hastening to her assistance.
"chieftains to assist them in their affrays with rival tribes, and made"
more than one alliance by giving such assistance. But the later
atrocities perpetrated by the Spaniards seem to have had the effect of
uniting the Indians in a tacit peaceful bond against the whites.
"Picturesque and graphic as are the writings of men like Esquemeling, the"
"Fray d’Acosta and Wafer, who saw the Indians in the days of their"
earliest experience with the sort of civilization that Pedrarias and
"Pizarro brought to their villages, they do not bear more convincing"
"evidence of the savagery of the invaders, than is afforded by the sullen"
aloofness with which the Darien Indians of today regard white men of any
race. More than the third and fourth generation have passed away but the
sins of the Spaniards are still recalled among a people who have no
"written records whatsoever, and the memory or tradition causes them to"
withhold their friendship from the remotest descendants of the historic
oppressors.
"There seems to have been no written language, nor even any system of"
"hieroglyphics among the tribes of Panama, a fact that places them far"
below our North American Indians in the scale of mental development. On
the other hand in weaving and in fashioning articles for domestic use
they were in advance of the North American aborigines. Their domestic
"architecture was more substantial, and they were less nomadic, the"
latter fact being probably due to the slight encouragement given to
wandering by the jungle. The great houses of the San Blas Indians in
their villages recall the “Long houses” of the Iroquois as described by
Parkman.

CHOCO INDIAN IN EVERY-DAY DRESS]
DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY
"And lastly, what are our duties to our country? These are essentially to"
win honour for it and also win for it security and peace. As regards
"winning honour for our country, it is true that while India has offered"
from the earliest times welcome and hospitality to all peoples and
nationalities her children have been subjected to intolerable
humiliations in other countries even under the flag of our king.
There can be no question of the fundamental duty of every Indian to
stand up and uphold the honour of his country and strove for the removal
of wrong.
"The general task of redressing wrong is not a problem of India alone,"
but one in which the righteous men are interested the world over. For
"wrong cries for redress everywhere, in the clashings interests of the"
"rich and poor, between capital and labour, between those who hold the"
"power and those from whom it has been withheld,--in a word in the"
struggle of the Disinherited.
When any man is rendered unable to uphold his manhood and self-respect
and woman are deprived of the chivalrous protection and consideration of
"men and subjected to degradation, the general level of manhood or"
womanhood in the world is lowered. It then becomes an outrage to
humanity and a challenge to all men to safeguard the sacredness of our
common human nature.
What is the machinery which sets a going a world movement for the
redress of wrong? For this I need not cite instances from the history of
other countries but take one which is known to you and in which the
living actors are still among us. In the midst of the degradation of his
CHAPTER XIV
THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
WHAT A FORMATION RECORDS. We have already learned that each
"individual body of stratified rock, or formation, constitutes a"
record of the time when it was laid. The structure and the
character of the sediments of each formation tell whether the area
was land or sea at the time when they were spread; and if the
"former, whether the land was river plain, or lake bed, or was"
"covered with wind-blown sands, or by the deposits of an ice sheet."
"If the sediments are marine, we may know also whether they were"
"laid in shoal water near the shore or in deeper water out at sea,"
"and whether during a period of emergence, or during a period of"
subsidence when the sea transgressed the land. By the same means
each formation records the stage in the cycle of erosion of the
land mass from which its sediments were derived. An unconformity
between two marine formations records the fact that between the
periods when they were deposited in the sea the area emerged as
land and suffered erosion. The attitude and structure of the
"strata tell also of the foldings and fractures, the deformation"
"and the metamorphism, which they have suffered; and the igneous"
rocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous intrusions
add other details to the story. Each formation is thus a separate
"local chapter in the geological history of the earth, and its"
strata are its leaves. It contains an authentic record of the
physical conditions--the geography--of the time and place when and
where its sediments were laid.
PAST CYCLES OF EROSION. These chapters in the history of the
"That, however, despite the largely fanciful character of the entries in"
"the omen texts, these collections not only rested on a firm basis of"
"actual observation, but served a practical purpose is shown by the"
examples that we have of official reports made by the =bârû=-priests of
"human and animal anomalies, with the interpretations attached that"
represent quotations from the collections[21]. A report of this kind in
reference to an animal monstrosity reads in part as follows[22]:
"'If it is a double foetus, but with one head, a double spine, two"
"tails and one body, the land that is now ruled by two will be ruled"
by one person.
"If it is a double foetus with one head, the land will be safe.'"
We have here two quotations from a text furnishing all kinds of
peculiarities connected with a double foetus and we are fortunate in
having the text from which the quotations are made[23]. Evidently an ewe
"has given birth to a monstrosity such as is here described, the case has"
"been reported to the diviners who furnish the king[24] with this report,"
"indicating that since the monstrosity has only one head, what might have"
been an unfavorable omen is converted into a favorable one.
Another report[25] regarding a monstrosity born of a sow reads:
"'If a foetus has eight feet and two tails, the ruler will acquire"
"universal sway. A butcher, Uddanu by name, reported as follows: A sow"
gave birth (to a young) having eight feet and two tails. I have
preserved it in salt and kept it in the house. From
Nergal-eṭir[26].'
Here we have the name of the =bârû=-priest who made the report expressly
giving them their reddish tints.
LIFE OF THE DEVONIAN
PLANTS. The lands were probably clad with verdure during Silurian
"times, if not still earlier; for some rare remains of ferns and"
other lowly types of vegetation have been found in the strata of
that system. But it is in the Devonian that we discover for the
first time the remains of extensive and luxuriant forests. This
"rich flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, and it will be"
more convenient to describe its varied types in the next chapter.
RHIZOCARPS. In the shales of the Devonian are found microscopic
spores of rhizocarps in such countless numbers that their weight
must be reckoned in hundreds of millions of tons. It would seem
"that these aquatic plants culminated in this period, and in widely"
distant portions of the earth swampy flats and shallow lagoons
"were filled with vegetation of this humble type, either growing"
from the bottom or floating free upon the surface. It is to the
resinous spores of the rhizocarps that the petroleum and natural
gas from Devonian rocks are largely due. The decomposition of the
"spores has made the shales highly bituminous, and the oil and gas"
have accumulated in the reservoirs of overlying porous sandstones.
INVERTEBRATES. We must pass over the ever-changing groups of the
invertebrates with the briefest notice. Chain corals became
"extinct at the close of the Silurian, but other corals were"
extremely common in the Devonian seas. At many places corals
"formed thin reefs, as at Louisville, Kentucky, where the hardness"
of the reef rock is one of the causes of the Falls of the Ohio.
"Sponges, echinoderms, brachiopods, and mollusks were abundant. The"
"double wall of cells inclosing a body cavity, and with an opening,"
the primitive mouth. Each of these early embryological stages is
"represented by living animals,--the undivided cell by the"
"PROTOZOA, the blastosphere by some rare forms, and the gastrula in"
"the essential structure of the COELENTERATES,--the subkingdom to"
which the fresh-water hydra and the corals belong. All forms of
"animal life, from the coelenterates to the mammals, follow the"
same path in their embryological development as far as the
"gastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge, those of each"
subkingdom going their own separate ways.
"We may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods"
organic evolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The
earliest one-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-
"celled animals of the type of the blastosphere, and these by"
gastrula-like organisms. From the gastrula type the higher sub-
"divisions of animal life probably diverged, as separate branches"
from a common trunk. Much or all of this vast differentiation was
accomplished before the opening of the next era; for all the
subkingdoms are represented in the Cambrian except the
vertebrates.
EVIDENCES OF PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE. An indirect evidence of life
during the pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and
"varied fauna of the next period; for, if the theory of evolution"
"is correct, the differentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long"
process which might well have required for its accomplishment a
large part of pre-Cambrian time.
"Other indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron"
"ores, and graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have"
been formed in later times by the help of organisms. If the
better than dogma--Erasmus's talent and wit--Delight in words
and things--Prolixity--Observation of details--A veiled
realism--Ambiguousness--The 'Nuance'--Inscrutability of the
ultimate ground of all things
"Simplicity, naturalness, purity, and reasonableness, those are to"
"Erasmus the dominant requirements, also when we pass from his ethical"
"and aesthetic concepts to his intellectual point of view; indeed, the"
two can hardly be kept apart.
"The world, says Erasmus, is overloaded with human constitutions and"
"opinions and scholastic dogmas, and overburdened with the tyrannical"
"authority of orders, and because of all this the strength of gospel"
"doctrine is flagging. Faith requires simplification, he argued. What"
would the Turks say of our scholasticism? Colet wrote to him one day:
"'There is no end to books and science. Let us, therefore, leave all"
roundabout roads and go by a short cut to the truth.'
"Truth must be simple. 'The language of truth is simple, says Seneca;"
"well then, nothing is simpler nor truer than Christ.' 'I should wish',"
"Erasmus says elsewhere, 'that this simple and pure Christ might be"
"deeply impressed upon the mind of men, and that I deem best attainable"
"in this way, that we, supported by our knowledge of the original"
"languages, should philosophize _at the sources_ themselves.'"
Here a new watchword comes to the fore: back to the sources! It is not
"merely an intellectual, philological requirement; it is equally an"
"ethical and aesthetic necessity of life. The original and pure, all that"
"is not yet overgrown or has not passed through many hands, has such a"
potent charm. Erasmus compared it to an apple which we ourselves pick
"off the tree. To recall the world to the ancient simplicity of science,"
love and was dominated by a passion for this man.
"So that, with no reason whatever in her mind to question the sincerity"
"of Johnson's love for her, it would seem as if nothing were wanting to"
make the Girl perfectly happy; that there could be no room in her heart
"for any feeling other than elation. And yet, curiously enough, the Girl"
could not doze off to sleep. Some mysterious force--a vague foreboding
of something about to happen--impelled her to open her eyes again and
again.
"It was an odd and wholly new sensation, this conjuring up of distressing"
"spectres, for no girl was given less to that sort of thing; all the"
"same, it was with difficulty that she checked an impulse to cry out to"
"her lover--whom she believed to be asleep--and make him dissipate, by"
"renewed assurances, the mysterious barrier which she felt was hemming"
her in.
"As for Johnson, the moment that his head had touched the pillows, he"
"fell to thinking of the awkward situation in which he was placed, the"
"many complications in which his heart had involved him and, finally, he"
found himself wondering whether the woman whom he loved so dearly was
also lying sleepless in her rug on the floor.
And so it was not surprising that he should spring up the moment that he
heard cries from outside.
"""Who's that knockin', I wonder?"""
"Although her voice showed no signs of distress or annoyance, the"
"question coming from her in a calm tone, the Girl was upon her feet"
almost before she knew it. In a trice she removed all evidences that she
"had been lying upon the floor, flinging the pillows and silk coverlet to"
atheistic rhetoric has been placarded at the cost of the State in
every commune throughout France.
"We may consider, then, if there be any method by which the man who"
"does not read theological or scientific or philosophical books, the"
"man who has left off going to church, or gets no help from the"
"average sermon, the man who has no reverence for mere authority, may"
be induced to consider the Christian Revelation as offering him a key
to those riddles of life which his civic responsibilities are
perpetually propounding.
Remember that his present condition may be roughly described as
consisting of religious haziness and moral laziness. The moral
laziness is being subjected to a series of rough shocks. He _must_
make up his mind about some questions of morality. The relation of the
"sexes, the duties of property, the treatment of the subject savage,"
"the survival of the unfit, the ethics of commerce, the control of the"
"sale of alcohol, the education of children, these things he has to"
"decide and he will ultimately decide. But he is at present perplexed,"
and his religious haziness is the reason of his perplexity. He perhaps
"has not reached the conclusion of his contemporary in France, but he"
is on the way to it. Those heavenly lights which M. Viviani declares
that his Government has extinguished still shine faintly for men in
"England, though the mists obscure them."
"Can we get men to look upwards for light, and instead of cursing the"
"ancient creed in a confused commination, to take Arthur Clough’s"
advice--
“Ah! yet consider it again.”
"I believe that there is a method, and as I mention it I am prepared"
"in the intellectual life of a Nation, that of spontaneous outflow, that"
giving out of its life by which the world is enriched. When the Nation
"has lost this power, when it merely receives, but cannot give out, then"
"its healthy life is over, and it sinks into a degenerate existence which"
is purely parasitic.
HOW INDIA CAN TEACH
"How can our Nation give out of the fulness of the life that is in it,"
and how can a new Indian University help in the realisation of this
object? It is clear that its power of directing and inspiring will
depend on its world status. This can be secured to it by no artificial
"means, nor by any strength in the past; and what is the weakness that"
has been paralysing her activities for the accomplishment of any great
"scientific work? There must be two different elements, and these must be"
evenly balanced. Any excess of either will injure it.
HOW TO SECURE THIS STATUS
This world status can only be won by the intrinsic value of the great
contributions to be made by its own Indian scholars for the advancement
of the world's knowledge. To be organic and vital our new University
"must stand primarily for self-expression, and for winning for India a"
place she has lost. Knowledge is never the exclusive possession of any
"particular race, nor does it recognise geographical limitations. The"
"whole world is interdependent, and a constant stream of thought had been"
carried out throughout the ages enriching the common heritage of
mankind. Although science was neither of the East nor of the West but
"international, certain aspects of it gained richness by reason of their"
place of origin.
Lord.”
"Indeed, it is our misfortune in England that Bishops are almost"
necessarily bad leaders. We are told when an election to the Papacy is
imminent that this or that Cardinal is in the list of “Papabili”--a
possible Pope--so in like manner we may almost select amongst the
undergraduates of Oxford and Cambridge our future diocesans. These are
"men clever, shrewd, and hard-working, of estimable private character,"
and not without some modest patrimony. Early entered in the race for
"preferment, ambitious, and yet, _mirabile dictu_, devout, they are"
"endowed first of all with the true qualification for episcopacy, a"
capacity for compromise and a pliant political mind. _Sic itur ad
"astra_ the excellent curate or tutor, the courteous and accomplished"
"chaplain to the Bishop, the eloquent canon and ecclesiastical courtier"
is consecrated and enthroned. Henceforward for the rest of his days he
"must hurry from his study table, crowded with correspondence, to his"
"confirmations, his diocesan society meetings, and his weary,"
humiliating attendance at the House of Lords. What wonder if Bishops
"discourage new ventures of faith, who have no time for thinking, no"
"time for reading, and perhaps, sometimes, too little opportunity for"
prayer!
And so we find them not unwilling to accommodate the Catholic Faith to
"the popular prejudice of the moment, acquiescing in an undogmatic,"
"undenominational, more or less Christian creed. Popularity becomes the"
"very breath of their nostrils, and they proceed to hide in an"
"appendix to the Prayer-book, the hymn _Quicunque vult_."
Yet the discerning can see that now is no time for keeping in the

containing dark blood.
On the commencement of the third day the patient's expression
"was extremely anxious, and he was suffering great pain. Pulse"
"96, temperature 100°. Tongue moist, occasional vomiting, bowels"
open yesterday. Has taken fluid nourishment since injury. The
"abdomen moved with respiration, but was moderately distended,"
especially in the line of the transverse colon; it was
"tympanitic on percussion, there was no dulness in the flanks,"
and only moderate rigidity of the wall on palpation. Frothy
fluid stained with bile and fæcal in odour was escaping from
"the wound of exit, and the everted margins of the latter were"
bile-stained.
A vertical incision was carried downwards from the wound for 4
inches. A rugged furrow was found on the under surface of the
left lobe of the liver; the stomach was contracted and firmly
adherent by recent lymph to the under surface of the liver and
the diaphragm. The transverse colon was much distended. On
separating the stomach a slit wound was found at the lesser
"curvature, immediately to the right of the oesophagus. This"
wound was closed with some difficulty with two tiers of
"sutures; the cavity was mopped out, and then irrigated with"
boiled water; a plug was introduced along the line of the
"furrow in the liver, and the lower part of the abdominal"
incision closed.
"The patient stood the operation well, and was removed to his"
"tent; during the day, however, two thunder showers occurred"
"during each of which water, several inches if not a foot deep,"
rushed through the camp. After the second flood he was removed
"to the operating room, the only house we had, and slept there."
"BRACHIOPODS. These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and"
"two interior armlike processes which served for breathing,"
"appeared in the Algonkian, and had now become very abundant. The"
"two valves of the brachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in"
each valve a line drawn from the beak to the base divides the
valve into two equal parts. It may thus be told from the pelecypod
"mollusk, such as the clam, whose two valves are not far from equal"
"in size, each being divided into unequal parts by a line dropped"
from the beak.
Brachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that
of the INARTICULATE brachiopods--the two valves are held together
"only by muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is"
"composed of phosphate of lime. The DISCINA, which began in the"
"Algonkian, is of this type, as is also the LINGULELLA of the"
Cambrian. Both of these genera have lived on during the millions
"of years of geological time since their introduction, handing down"
from generation to generation with hardly any change to their
descendants now living off our shores the characters impressed
upon them at the beginning.
The more highly organized ARTICULATE brachiopods have valves of
carbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and
"sockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,"
though the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.
MOLLUSKS. The three chief classes of mollusks--the PELECYPODS
"(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the GASTROPODS"
"(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the"
"CEPHALOPODS (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were"
"all represented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly."
"Recognizing in the officers' quarry the supposed figure of Emerson, the"
"hated cause of all this strife, the strikers gave vent to a great shout"
"of rage and triumph, and surged forward across the wide street,"
carrying the police before them with irresistible force.
In a moment it became not a question of keeping the entrance to the
"wharf, but of protecting the life of the prisoner, and the policemen"
"rallied with their backs to the wall, their clubs working havoc with"
the heads that came within striking distance.
"Scarcely had Boyd reached Big George, when a wing of the besieging army"
swept in through the unguarded entrance and down the dock like an
"avalanche, leaving behind them the battling officers and the hungry"
pack clamoring for the prisoner.
"""Drop that freight, and get aboard the best way you can!"" Boyd yelled"
"at the fishermen, and with a bound was out into the open crying to"
Captain Peasley on the bridge:
"""Here they come! Cast off, for God's sake!"""
Instantly a wild cry of rage and defiance rose from the clotted rigging
"and upper works of _The Bedford Castle_. Down the fishermen swarmed,"
"ready to over-flow the sides of the ship, but, with a sharp order to"
"George, Boyd ran up the gang-plank and rushed along the rail to a"
"commanding position in the path of his men, where, drawing his"
"revolver, he roared at them to keep back, threatening the first to go"
"ashore. His lungs were bursting from his sprint, and it was with"
difficulty that his voice rose above the turmoil; but he presented such
"a figure of determination that the men paused, and then the steamship"
"whistle interrupted opportunely, with a deafening blast."
Competent proofreaders in the best offices frequently call the
"attention of the author to errors in dates, figures, or proper names,"
but this should always be regarded by the author as a courtesy
rather than as something which the printer is expected to do. The
"proofreader, on the other hand, is supposed to have corrected every"
"typographical error, and for the author to mark corrections which have"
been overlooked is a courtesy on the part of the author. The fact that
the author or editor has passed over typographical errors in no way
relieves the proofreader of his responsibility.
The proofreader is expected to correct any obvious error without
"hesitation, but to make no other changes. If he thinks a change should"
"be made, it will take the form of a query in the margin to the author."
"The author should carefully note all such queries, and answer them"
"or strike them out, bearing in mind that if he accepts the query the"
"change necessitated in the type becomes an author's correction, the"
expense of which falls upon the publisher.
Any marks on the proofs for correction should be made distinct by
"drawing a short line through the letter to be changed, etc., placing in"
"the margin the recognized sign indicating the change, _exactly opposite"
"the line in which the change is to be made, and in the order in which"
the necessary alterations occur_. In doing this be sure to write
"legibly, and do not cover the proof with lines and counter-lines."
The author should familiarize himself with the standard proofreading
"marks, and employ these in marking all corrections upon the proofs"
which are sent him. These marks are as follows:

scientist to-day would say of the Resurrection of Jesus on which
"ultimately depends His claims to our adoration, “_That could not"
happen_.” We know enough now of the laws of the Universe to know that
we do not know them all.
So some of us perceive that what is needed to-day is to arrest the
"attention of the man in the street, to get him to perceive that"
"Christianity has much more to say for itself than he suspected, and"
that Christian Philosophy will place in his hand a clue which will
guide him in the labyrinth of life.
“I say the acknowledgment of God in Christ
"Accepted by thy reason, solves for thee"
All questions in the earth and out of it.”
We must set men free from phrases and get them to think. It suits the
game of the party politician to pretend that ethics are easily
"self-evident, and that there is a simple fundamental religion on which"
all men are agreed; but there is a question which must be insistently
"urged, and upon the answer to which all things depend, “What think ye"
of Christ?”
Probably nothing has done more to alienate the man in the street from
religious observance than the hypocritical pretence that all men are
agreed about “simple Bible teaching.” He knows well enough that what
really matters is whether a man believes or not that God became man.
If ever the Labour Party should definitely declare for elementary
education without religious teaching it will be because the men whose
children attend the elementary schools know that they cannot read the
"New Testament without asking, “Is it true?”"

"1. Each series of the stratified rocks, except the very deepest,"
contains vestiges of life. Hence THE EARTH WAS TENANTED BY LIVING
CREATURES FOR AN UNCALCULATED LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN HISTORY
BEGAN.
2. LIFE ON THE EARTH HAS BEEN EVERCHANGING. The youngest strata
hold the remains of existing species of animals and plants and
those of species and varieties closely allied to them. Strata
"somewhat older contain fewer existing species, and in strata of a"
"still earlier, but by no means an ancient epoch, no existing"
species are to be found; the species of that epoch and of previous
epochs have vanished from the living world. During all geological
time since life began on earth old species have constantly become
extinct and with them the genera and families to which they
"belong, and other species, genera, and families have replaced"
them. The fossils of each formation differ on the whole from those
of every other. The assemblage of animals and plants (the FAUNA-
FLORA) of each epoch differs from that of every other epoch.
In many cases the extinction of a type has been gradual; in other
instances apparently abrupt. There is no evidence that any
organism once become extinct has ever reappeared. The duration of
"a species in time, or its ""vertical range"" through the strata,"
varies greatly. Some species are limited to a stratum a few feet
in thickness; some may range through an entire formation and be
found but little modified in still higher beds. A formation may
"thus often be divided into zones, each characterized by its own"
"peculiar species. As a rule, the simpler organisms have a longer"
"duration as species, though not as individuals, than the more"
complex.
commences later. Their sensible properties and medical activity are
"impaired by long keeping. They should be of a green color, and free from"
"mustiness. The root has a feeble earthy odor. Though sweetish at first,"
it has afterwards the same effect as the leaves upon the mouth and
"fauces. It shrinks much in drying and becomes darker, but does not lose"
"its acrimony. Those parcels, whether of leaves or roots, should always"
be rejected which are destitute of this property. Aconite root is
"officially described as being “slenderly conical, 4 to 10 cm. long, 10"
to 20 mm. thick at the crown; occasionally split; longitudinally
wrinkled; dark brown and marked with coarse whitish root-scars; fracture
"short, horny or mealy; internally whitish or light brown; the cambium"
"zone irregular and 5 to 7-angled; odor very slight; taste sweetish, soon"
"becoming acrid and developing a tingling sensation, followed by"
numbness.”
Preparations of the leaves are not official in the U. S. P. The root is
five times stronger than the leaves.
CONSTITUENTS.--The alkaloid representing the action of the drug is
"aconitine, which is precipitated by ammonia from an aqueous solution of"
"an alcoholic extract of the root of various species. It is a colorless,"
"crystalline or amorphous, gray powder, almost insoluble in water, and"
"soluble in 22 parts of alcohol, in 44 parts of ether and 1 part of"
"chloroform. Its salts are soluble in water. Aconitine or its solutions,"
"unless very dilute, are too poisonous to be tasted."
"Commercial preparations vary in purity and strength, and since it is"
extremely poisonous its internal administration is undesirable.
"Pseudo-aconitine, aconitine and other alkaloids in combination with"
"aconitic acid have been obtained from aconite, but their identity and"
chemistry are uncertain.

This poem is specially to be commended because it is another example of
the finer qualities which are developed in war.[44]
"Now, such a ballad as this, which, being pure narrative, could"
"easily be introduced into the story-hour, would do as much to foster"
"“_L'entente cordiale_” as any processions or civic demonstrations,"
or lavish international exchange of hospitality. It has also a great
practical application now that we are encouraging visits between
English and foreign children. Let us hope the _entente cordiale_ will
not stop at France. There must be many such instances of magnanimity
"and generosity displayed to us by other nations, and it might be"
well to collect them and include them among stories for the school
curriculum.
"But in all our stories, in order to produce desired effects we must"
"refrain from holding, as Burroughs says, “a brief for either side,” and"
we must leave the decision of the children free in this matter.[45]
"In a review of Ladd's _Psychology_ in the “Academy,” we find a passage"
which refers as much to the story as to the novel:
"metamorphic rocks, is composed of mica and quartz in alternating"
"wavy folia. All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced,"
and in many cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of
slates and shales. It is widespread in New England and along the
eastern side of the Appalachians. TALC SCHIST consists of quartz
"and TALC, a light-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel, and so"
soft that it can be scratched with the thumb nail.
"HORNBLENDE SCHIST, resulting in many cases from the foliation of"
"basic igneous rocks, is made of folia of hornblende alternating"
with bands of quartz and feldspar. Hornblende schist is common
over large areas in the Lake Superior region.
QUARTZ SCHIST is produced from quartzite by the development of
fine folia of mica along planes of shear. All gradations may be
found between it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica
schist on the other.
Under the resistless pressure of crustal movements almost any
"rocks, sandstones, shales, lavas of all kinds, granites, diorites,"
and gabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and
"shearing. Limestones, however, are metamorphosed by pressure into"
"marble, the grains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to"
interlocking crystals of calcite.
These few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic
"rocks. As we have seen, they owe their origin to the alteration of"
both of the other classes of rocks--the sedimentary and the
"igneous--by heat and pressure, assisted usually by the presence of"
water. The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid
"cementation, their more or less complete recrystallization, and"
their foliation; but the change is often so complete that no trace
and volatile oils.
ACTIONS.--Phenol in large and undiluted doses is an irritant and
"narcotic poison; it is used as an antiseptic, parasiticide, antiferment"
and sometimes used as a local anaesthetic or anodyne in a 2 to 5 per
"cent solution; also as a caustic, but should not be used as a caustic as"
a burn from it heals very slowly.
USES.--Internally as a gastric sedative in small doses for vomiting in
dogs; is administered in various contagious and infectious diseases with
the view of preventing or arresting the development of micro-organisms;
"it coagulates albumen, is not nearly so active as bichloride of mercury;"
1 part to 500 parts of water prevents the growth of anthrax and other
"bacilli. Full doses produce gastro-enteritis, and collapse, which may"
"end fatally; it is a muscular and nerve paralyzer, both internally and"
"externally, it kills by paralyzing the muscles of respiration and the"
"heart. It is chiefly eliminated from the system by the kidneys, giving"
the urine a brownish color.
IN SURGERY.--A three to five per cent solution is used for washing out
"wounds, a two to three per cent for hands, and for itching of the skin,"
"carbolic acid three or four drachms, glycerine two ounces to one pint of"
water. Do not use over large surface on dogs and not at all on cats.
"Phenol treatment for Tetanus, which has given very good results and I"
"would recommend one drachm in three ounces of water, injected"
hypodermically in the region of neck and shoulder every two or three
hours until twelve injections were given and less frequently thereafter.
"DOSES.--Of the phenol: Horses and cattle, 10 to 40 grs.; sheep and pigs,"
"5 to 10 grs.; dogs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 gr., well diluted."
tender. Bowels confined. The column had to move at 5 A.M. the
"next morning, when the temperature was still near freezing, and"
during the day continuous fighting prevented any chance of
"operation. The man steadily sank during the day, and died"
thirty-six hours after the reception of the injury.
"_Post-mortem condition._--Belly not distended, dull anteriorly"
"in patches, and right flank dull throughout. When the belly was"
"opened, extensive adhesion of omentum and intestine enclosing"
"numerous collections of pus were disclosed, and on disturbing"
the adhesions a large collection of turbid blood-stained fluid
was set free from the right loin. The great omentum was much
"thickened and matted, with deposition of thick patches of"
lymph; very firm recent adhesions also united numerous coils of
"small intestine. The pus was foetid, but no appreciable"
quantity of intestinal contents was detected in it. The lower
"half or more of the small intestine was injected, reddened, and"
thickened. The wounds which were situated in the lower part of
"the jejunum and ileum were multiple, and seven perforations"
were detected; besides these the intestine was marked by
"bruises, and some gutter slits affecting the serous and"
muscular coats only. Considerable ecchymosis surrounded these
"latter. The clean perforations were circular, less than 1/4"
"inch in diameter, and for the most part closed by eversion of"
"the mucous membrane. Intestinal contents were not apparent, but"
escaped freely on manipulation of the bowel.

"eighth rib in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, 1 inch to the"

"injury, and the bowels acted frequently. This condition"
"[Sidenote: Repeal of Foreign Enlistment Act. 59 G. 3, c. 69.]"
"31. From and after the commencement of this Act, an Act passed in the"
"fifty-ninth year of the reign of His late Majesty King George the Third,"
"chapter sixty-nine, intituled ""An Act to prevent the enlisting or"
"engagement of His Majesty's subjects to serve in foreign service, and"
"the fitting out or equipping, in His Majesty's dominions, vessels for"
"warlike purposes, without His Majesty's license,"" shall be repealed:"
"Provided that such repeal shall not affect any penalty, forfeiture, or"
other punishment incurred or to be incurred in respect of any offence
"committed before this Act comes into operation, nor the institution of"
"any investigation or legal proceeding, or any other remedy for enforcing"
"any such penalty, forfeiture, or punishment as aforesaid."
[Sidenote: Saving as to Commissioned Foreign Ships.]
32. Nothing in this Act contained shall subject to forfeiture any
"commissioned ship of any foreign state, or give to any British court"
over or in respect of any ship entitled to recognition as a commissioned
ship of any foreign state any jurisdiction which it would not have had
if this Act had not passed.

"Service in Asia. 59 G. 3, c. 69, s. 12.]"
33. Nothing in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend

or potentates of Asia.
highly-developed imagination of the one and the stodgy prosaical
temperament of the other. Tom could enter into the elementary question
"of giving his school-fellow a black eye, but could not possibly enter"
into the drama of the imaginary arrival of a lion. He was sorely in
need of Fairy Stories.
"It is for this element we have to cater, and we cannot shirk our"
responsibilities.
"William James says: “Living things, moving things or things that"
"savour of danger or blood, that have a dramatic quality, these are"
"the things natively interesting to childhood, to the exclusion of"
"almost everything else, and the teacher of young children (until more"
artificial interests have grown up) will keep in touch with his pupils
by constant appeal to such matters as those.”[34]
Of course the savour of danger and blood is only _one_ of the things to
"which we should appeal, but I give the whole passage to make the point"
clearer.
"This is one of the most difficult parts of our selection, namely, how"
to present enough excitement for the child and yet include enough
constructive element which will satisfy him when the thirst for
“blugginess” is slaked.
"And here I should like to say that, whilst wishing to encourage in"
children great admiration and reverence for the courage and other fine
"qualities which have been displayed in times of war, and which have"
"mitigated its horrors, I think we should show that some of the finest"
moments in these heroes' lives had nothing to do with their profession
as soldiers. Thus we have the well-known story of Sir Philip Sidney and
the soldier; the wonderful scene where Roland drags the bodies of his
only subtlety and arid ingenuity. All symbolism and allegory were
"fundamentally alien to him and indifferent, though he occasionally tried"
his hand at an allegory; and he never was mystically inclined.
Now here it is just as much the deficiencies of his own mind as the
qualities of the system which made him unable to appreciate it. While he
struck at the abuse of ceremonies and of Church practices both with
"noble indignation and well-aimed mockery, a proud irony to which he was"
not fully entitled preponderates in his condemnation of scholastic
theology which he could not quite understand. It was easy always to talk
with a sneer of the conservative divines of his time as _magistri
nostri_.
His noble indignation hurt only those who deserved castigation and
"strengthened what was valuable, but his mockery hurt the good as well as"
"the bad in spite of him, assailed both the institution and persons, and"
injured without elevating them. The individualist Erasmus never
"understood what it meant to offend the honour of an office, an order, or"
"an establishment, especially when that institution is the most sacred of"
"all, the Church itself."
Erasmus's conception of the Church was no longer purely Catholic. Of
that glorious structure of medieval-Christian civilization with its
"mystic foundation, its strict hierarchic construction, its splendidly"
fitting symmetry he saw hardly anything but its load of outward details
and ornament. Instead of the world which Thomas Aquinas and Dante had
"described, according to their vision, Erasmus saw another world, full of"
"charm and elevated feeling, and this he held up before his compatriots."

They did not stop at the street level; they continued on down another
"ramp, around a bend, descending an even steeper incline toward the"
bowels of Jupiter. Their descent ended at last before a huge metal
"barrier which, at a signal from the leader, drew smoothly up into the"
"ceiling to disclose a gigantic, red-lit chamber underlying the"
foundations of the building.
"In fear and awe, Dex gazed around that huge room."
It resembled in part a nightmare rearrangement of such a laboratory as
might be found on Earth; and in part a torture chamber such as the
most ferocious of savages might have devised had they been
scientifically equipped to add contrivances of supercivilization to
the furthering of their primitive lust for cruelty.
There were great benches--head-high to the Earthman--to accommodate
the height of the Rogan workmen. There were numberless metal
"instruments, and glass coils, and enormous retorts; and in one corner"
"an orange colored flame burnt steadily on a naked metal plate, seeming"
to have no fuel or other source of being.
There was a long rack of cruelly pointed and twisted instruments.
"Under this was a row of long, delicate pincers, with coils on the"
handles to indicate that they might be heated to fiendish precision of
temperatures. There were gleaming metal racks with calibrated
slide-rods and spring dials to denote just what pull was being exerted
on whatever unhappy creature might be stretched taut on them. There
"were tiny cones of metal whose warped, baked appearance testified that"
they were little portable furnaces that could be placed on any desired
"portion of the anatomy, to slowly bake the selected disk of flesh"
beneath them.
"nature worship, and could never be completely disguised by means of mystic"
interpretations. Never was the lack of harmony greater between the
moralizing tendencies of theologians and the cruel shamelessness of
tradition. A god held up as the august lord of the universe was the pitiful
"and abject hero of an obscene love affair; the taurobolium, performed to"
satisfy man's most exalted aspirations for spiritual purification and
"immortality, looked like a {72} shower bath of blood and recalled"
cannibalistic orgies. The men of letters and senators attending those
"mysteries saw them performed by painted eunuchs, ill reputed for their"
"infamous morals, who went through dizzy dances similar to those of the"
dancing dervishes and the Aissaouas. We can imagine the repugnance these
ceremonies caused in everybody whose judgment had not been destroyed by a
fanatical devotion. Of no other pagan superstition do the Christian
"polemicists speak with such profound contempt, and there is undoubtedly a"
reason for their attitude. But they were in a more fortunate position than
their pagan antagonists; their doctrine was not burdened with barbarous
traditions dating back to times of savagery; and all the ignominies that
stained the old Phrygian religion must not prejudice us against it nor
cause us to slight the long continued efforts that were made to refine it
gradually and to mould it into a form that would fulfil the new demands of
morality and enable it to follow the laborious march of Roman society on
the road of religious progress.

this last line being certainly one of the most suggestive and beautiful
in all poetical literature. Such expressions have the intrinsic quality
"of COMPLETENESS,--once said, we feel that they can never be said"
"again;--they belong to the centuries, rather than the seasons, and any"
imitation of them we immediately and instinctively resent as an outrage.
"And Theos Alwyn was essentially, and above all things, faithful to the"
"lofty purpose of his calling,--he dealt with his art reverently, and"
"not in rough haste and scrambling carelessness,--if he worked out any"
"idea in rhyme, the idea was distinct and the rhyme was perfect,--he was"
"not content, like Browning, to jumble together such hideous and"
"ludicrous combinations as ""high;--Humph!"" and ""triumph,""--moreover, he"
"knew that what he had to tell his public must be told comprehensively,"
"yet grandly, with all the authority and persuasiveness of incisive"
"rhetoric, yet also with all the sweetness and fascination of a"
"passioned love-song. Occupied with such work as this, London, with its"
"myriad mad noises and vulgar distractions, became impossible to"
"him,--and Villiers, his fidus Achates, who had read portions of his"
"great poem and was impatient to see it finished, knowing, as he did,"
"what an enormous sensation it would create when published, warmly"
seconded his own desire to gain a couple of months complete seclusion
and tranquillity.
"He left town, therefore, about the middle of May and started across the"
"Channel, resolving to make for Switzerland by the leisurely and"
"delightful way of the Rhine, in order to visit Bonn, the scene of his"
"old student days. What days they had been!--days of dreaming, more than"
the stream or by the general erosion of the land.
In the sea the conditions for preservation are more favorable than
on land; yet even here the proportion of animals and plants whose
hard parts are fossilized is very small compared with those which
either totally decay before they are buried in slowly accumulating
sediments or are ground to powder by waves and currents.
"We may infer that during each period of the past, as at the"
"present, only a very insignificant fraction of the innumerable"
organisms of sea and land escaped destruction and left in
continental and oceanic deposits permanent records of their
"existence. Scanty as these original life records must have been,"
they have been largely destroyed by metamorphism of the rocks in
"which they were imbedded, by solution in underground waters, and"
by the vast denudation under which the sediments of earlier
periods have been eroded to furnish materials for the sedimentary
"records of later times. Moreover, very much of what has escaped"
destruction still remains undiscovered. The immense bulk of the
"stratified rocks is buried and inaccessible, and the records of"
the past which it contains can never be known. Comparatively few
outcrops have been thoroughly searched for fossils. Although new
"species are constantly being discovered, each discovery may be"
"considered as the outcome of a series of happy accidents,--that"
the remains of individuals of this particular species happened to
"be imbedded and fossilized, that they happened to escape"
"destruction during long ages, and that they happened to be exposed"
and found.
SOME INFERENCES FROM THE RECORDS OF THE HISTORY OF LIFE UPON THE
"PLANET. Meager as are these records, they set forth plainly some"
important truths which we will now briefly mention.
"difficult to recruit members, the festivities, once so popular, fell into"
"desuetude, and {38} Varro, at the beginning of his _Antiquities_, expressed"
"his fear lest ""the gods might perish, not from the blows of foreign"
"enemies, but from very neglect on the part of the citizens.""[21] It is well"
"known that Augustus, prompted by political rather than by religious"
"reasons, attempted to revive the dying religion. His religious reforms"
stood in close relation to his moral legislation and the establishment of
the imperial dignity. Their tendency was to bring the people back to the
pious practice of ancient virtues but also to chain them to the new
political order. The alliance of throne and altar in Europe dates from that
time.
This attempted reform failed entirely. Making religion an auxiliary to
moral policing is not a means of establishing its empire over souls. Formal
reverence for the official gods is not incompatible with absolute and
practical skepticism. The restoration attempted by Augustus is nevertheless
very characteristic because it is so consistent with the Roman spirit which
by temperament and tradition demanded that religion should support morality
and the state.
"The Asiatic religions fulfilled the requirements. The change of régime,"
"although unwelcome, brought about a change of religion. The increasing"
tendency of Cæsarism toward absolute monarchy made it lean more and more
upon the Oriental clergy. True to the traditions of the Achemenides and the
"Pharaohs, those priests preached doctrines tending to elevate the sovereign"
"above humanity, and they supplied the emperors with dogmatic justification"
for their despotism.[22]
It is a noteworthy fact that the rulers who most loudly proclaimed their
"autocratic pretentions, like {39} Domitian and Commodus, were also those"
that favored foreign creeds most openly.
"be dilated or contracted, but as the end approaches remains dilated;"
"shallow irregular and labored respiration, a slow and small pulse,"
"becoming rapid and imperceptible near the end. Gulping, frothy saliva,"
"flatulence, belching, retching, nausea, etc. There is often a peculiar"
clicking sound made from the constant attempts at swallowing.
"Coldness of surface, clammy sweat, anxious countenance, extreme weakness"
"of the extremities, lowering of temperature 2 to 3 degrees, abolishment"
"of sensation, reflexes and motility and finally death from paralysis of"
"the heart and respiration, with or without convulsions, consciousness"
"being preserved until near the end, when carbon dioxide narcosis sets"

"USES.--It antagonizes the fever process, when properly used is a most"
"valuable drug; it is indicated in all affections, characterized by high"
"resisting pulse, dry, hot skin and elevated body temperature; is useful"
"in acute throat affections as laryngitis, pharyngitis and perotiditis,"
in small doses often repeated. Indicated in acute inflammation of the
"organs of respiration. For pleurisy and perotiditis, at the outset, give"
aconite with opium. Aconite is indicated in simple fevers or in
"puerperal fever, inflammation of the brain; in acute or inflammatory"
"rheumatism, in acute local inflammation, as arthritis or inflammation"
"resulting from bruises, sprains, etc."
"In lymphangitis, laminitis and enteritis, if called in first stages of"
enteritis give 20 ms. of aconite and repeat with 10 or 15 ms. every hour
and between times gives fluid extract of belladonna 15 to 20 ms. every
hour and externally woolen blankets wrung out of hot water and wrapped
around the body.
"In mammitis is also useful in large doses, combined with phytolacca; in"

"Composed of boric acid, 310 parts; glycerin to make 1,000; prepared by"
heat (303° F.).
"ACTIONS.--Boric acid is a non-volatile, non-irritating antiseptic,"
"deodorant and astringent, it arrests fermentation of minute organisms,"
"free of irritating effects in solution, when applied to wounds; it"
"lessens suppuration, and is as effective as carbolic acid; can be used"
in any strength from the pure powder or saturated solution to the
mildest form.
USES.--Boric acid is indicated for all purposes for which an antiseptic
"is used; it is used in diarrhoea in foals, calves and dogs, combined"
with other drugs; it has a slightly astringent action of itself; it is
"excreted in the urine, consequently would exert its influence on the"
"bladder in cystitis, cystic catarrh; 1 part in 800 prevents the"
"development of anthrax-bacilli; useful in skin diseases, also used in"
"keratitis and catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis, six to ten grains"
"to the ounce, with atropine or cocaine when very painful. Useful in"
"distemper of dogs where the bowels are affected, as an antiseptic."
Boric acid is preferred to carbolic acid as an antiseptic for dogs. On
"account of the paralyzing effect of carbolic acid on the nerves, it"
"hinders the healing of wounds to a certain extent, while the boracic"
acid does not.
Boric acid may be applied pure to wounds and sores or mixed with other
suitable drugs as a dusting powder. Equal parts of boric acid and zinc
oxide make a cheap and effective healing powder; to an itching wound the
addition of an equal quantity of acetanilide increases its value. A
saturated solution (four per cent) is useful as a vaginal and uterine
douche and to flush the bladder in cystitis.
"PROPERTIES.--A white, crystalline powder, without odor, having a"
sweetish and afterwards astringent taste; permanent in the air; soluble
in one part of water; insoluble in alcohol.
DOSE.--Same as alum.
"ACTIONS.--Astringent, at first excites flow of saliva, then markedly"
"decreases it; coagulates pepsin, thus it would derange or entirely"
"arrest digestion; it also stops peristalsis and produces constipation,"
though sometimes it induces diarrhoea by irritation. It arrests
secretions in general and in the circulation contracts the capillaries;
"it is in this way it arrests secretions, especially those of mucous"
"surfaces, and stops capillary hemorrhage. The sulphate of aluminum is"
"mildly caustic, astringent and antiseptic. Dried alum is caustic and"
astringent.
"EXTERNALLY.--Dried alum is a caustic, in contact with raw sores, on"
"account of its affinity for water. Alum has no action on unbroken skin,"
but applied to mucous membranes or denuded parts it is antiseptic and
astringent; coagulates albumin of discharges; precipitates or coagulates
albumin of the tissues; squeeze blood out of the vessels; reduces
"inflammation and makes the part whiter, brings together and denser. Alum"
"is a hemostatic, stopping bleeding by compression of the structures"
surrounding the vessels and by causing blood to clot.
"USES.--In diarrhoea and dysentery, but other astringents are safer and"
"better, as it may lock the bowels too tight, may be used in weeping"
sores or weeping skin diseases; in long standing nail wounds by putting
"one-half to one pound into the soaking tub, also in same way for injured"
"coronets, with raw bulging surfaces that bleed easily, also for sore"
"mouth, sometimes mix a little boric acid; useful in bleeding piles, and"
in mild solution alum one ounce to water one pint for sore throat; also

[ SIGHS ] FINE.
GET YOUR DOCUMENTS TOGETHER.
I'LL HAVE MY GUYS DO AN I.D. PACKAGE.
GO SEE EVELYN FIRST.
THANKS.
I SEPARATED FROM DOUG A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I TRIED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR JASPER'S SAKE.
THAT'S OUR SON.
BUT IT WAS HARD ON HIM LISTENING TO US FIGHT ALL THE TIME.
"HE STARTED ACTING UP AT SCHOOL, AND THEN DOUG TURNED ON HIM,"
AND I WASN'T GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.
I'M SURE YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
HE TOOK HIM.
"HE PICKED HIM UP EARLY AT SCHOOL ONE DAY, AND HE DISAPPEARED."
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?
"YEAH, EVERY DAY."
"BUT TECHNICALLY WE'RE STILL MARRIED,"
AND HE'S JASPER'S FATHER.
"SO WITHOUT A CUSTODY ORDER, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING."
"PLEASE, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO SORT THIS OUT."
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM?
NONE.
"I HAVE NO IDEA, BECAUSE I'VE HARDLY SPOKEN TO HIM IN MONTHS."
DO YOU HAVE PICTURES?
YEAH.
"HERE, THAT'S JASPER."
PLEASE.
LUCY SAID YOU COULD FIND HIM.
I NEED TO KNOW THAT HE'S OKAY.
IT GOT ME THINKING.
OUTDOOR TYPES ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE WOODS.
SO I GOT AHOLD OF A BUDDY OF MINE.
HE'S AT THE COAST GUARD.
"HE KNOWS A GUY IN PARK SERVICE, AND I SAID,"
"""THERE'S A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF PATR_N IN IT FOR YOU --"""
"JUST TELL ME, SAM."
STATE PARKS HAS A RECORD OF DOUG'S LICENSE PLATE
AT MANGROVE CAMPGROUND.
KEYS?
YEAH.
"I'D GO THERE WITH YOU,"
BUT VERONICA SORT OF SET UP A MINI VACATION IN BOCA --
ONE OF THOSE SWIMMING-WITH-THE-DOLPHINS --
"I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, SAM."
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU FOUND HIM SO QUICKLY.
THAT'S AMAZING.
MY FRIEND SAM MAY HAVE BRUISED
"A COUPLE OF FEDERAL STATUTES ALONG THE WAY,"
BUT NOTHING A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA CAN'T SMOOTH OVER.
"WELL, HE WON'T GET IN TROUBLE?"
WE FOUND HIM.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.
IS THAT LOADED?
YEAH.
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA BRING THAT WHEN YOU GO GET JASPER, RIGHT?"
IT'LL BE FINE.
TRUST ME.
THIS IS IT?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY GETTING HURT.
AND A TROUBLED BUT GIFTED SON --
"WELL,THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING."
ENOUGH ABOUT ME -
- LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.
"NO,I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT."
"YOU KNOW,I DON'T THINK"
THAT WE SHOULD WASTE ALL YOUR HARD WORK.
WHAT SAY WE SPLIT THE FEE?
YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE HE IS.
I WILL DO ALL THE REST.
IT'S EASY MONEY.
"EVELYN,I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS,"
BUT THERE COMES A TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY.
COME ON.
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO TO PERSUADE YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MIAMI?
"APART FROM YOU,OF COURSE."
THE CHEAP LABOR.
"YOU KNOW,I CAN GET A KID OFF THE STREET"
TO DO A HIT FOR ABOUT A GRAND.
"WELL,IF I FLIRT WITH HIM A LITTLE."
"SAY,NOW,ISN'T THAT LUCY?"
LUCY!
"MICHAEL,I AM SO SORRY."
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
"YES,IT IS."
YOU TAUGHT ME BETTER THAN THAT.
I'M SO STUPID.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THOROUGH.
I'VE GOT GUYS HEADED TO HER HOTEL RIGHT NOW.
IT WON'T MATTER.
UNLESS YOU TESTIFY?
"I DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED, BUT THEY SAID I'D GO TO JAIL."
I SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT.
THEN THINGS STARTED HAPPENING.
THINGS?
WHAT THINGS?
"I HAD PEOPLE FOLLOWING ME,"
"PHONE CALLS, GUYS WATCHING MY HOUSE."
THEN MY WIFE GOES OUT IN MY CAR.
"THEY SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,"
"BUT I SENT JASPER AWAY, AND I RAN."
WHO ARE THEY?
THEY'RE YOUR NEW BEST FRIENDS.
STAY HERE.
"HA,WELL,WHAT A PIECE OF WORK SHE IS."
SO EVELYN USED YOU TO DO THE GRUNT WORK
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
SHE SHOWS UP AND FINISHES THE JOB.
"AND WHEN SHE KILLS HIM, EVERYONE COMES LOOKING FOR YOU."
SHE SEEMED SO NICE.
"MIKE,SHE WENT THROUGH LUCY TO GET TO YOU."
"YEAH,CALL LUCY."
EVELYN'S NOT THE TYPE TO LEAVE LOOSE ENDS.
RIGHT.
"OH,ALMOST FORGOT, THAT'S FOR YOU."
EVELYN HAS THE CHARGER?
"YEAH, IT'S GONNA NEED SOME WORK."
AND YOUR GUN?
REMOVED THE TRIGGER-BAR SPRING.
"OH,THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD DO."
"YOU GUYS DO REALLY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,DON'T YOU?"
"LOOK,FI, I KNOW YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS."
YOU'RE DOING THE BEST THING.
"BELIEVE ME, I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."
"I'VE STAYED, AND I'VE LEFT."
SOMETIMES LEAVING IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
"IT MUST BE LONELY, WHAT YOU DO."
I COULDN'T LIVE THAT WAY.
"IN MY LINE OF WORK,"
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET TOO CLOSE.
WHAT IF YOU MET SOMEONE...
AND THERE'S A SPARK?
WOULD YOU IGNORE IT?
COULD YOU?
"I WOULD, UH..."
CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THE JOB DONE.
I GOT TO HEAD OVER TO DOUG'S.
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.
OKAY.
"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG, SAM?"
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR TOUCH?
I DIDN'T KNOW DOUG WOULD HAVE A NINE-PIN DIMPLE LOCK --
"YOU KNOW, THE NEW KIND, THE KIND I HAVEN'T PRACTICED ON?"
"OKAY, MY FINGERS ARE BLEEDING NOW."
THERE'S SOME PAIN INVOLVED.
"YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE"
WITH BARS ON ITS WINDOWS.
I WONDER WHAT DOUG WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.
"COME ON, BABY."
THERE BETTER BE SOMETHING GOOD IN HERE.
THERE WE GO.
GOT IT.
LOOKS LIKE HE DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH.
I'VE WORKED WITH LESS.
And that's the end of my 20-second break.
"Good luck, man."
"So, Emma, what kind of music do they play?"
It's like an '80s pop vibe mixed with a little Black Keys.
Cool.
This is gonna be painful.
Be nice.
"So, Emma, how do you know Mat?"
"I think what she's trying to ask is, does he have a girlfriend?"
That's definitely what she's trying to ask.
That's not what I was trying to ask.
Do you guys want me to ask?
"Hey, Mat!"
No!
That is not what I was asking.
He's single.

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEARN IN TRAINING
IS TO AVOID SITUATIONS THAT CUT TOO CLOSE.
"IF YOU HAD A ROUGH CHILDHOOD,"
A SITUATION WITH AN ABUSIVE FATHER AND A VULNERABLE KID
IS GONNA MAKE YOU ANGRY.
"THAT CAN BE MOTIVATING, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE DANGEROUS."
"WELL, SHE'S A LOOKER."
WHAT'S THE STORY?
HUSBAND RAN OFF WITH HER KID.
"YOU ALL RIGHT, MIKE?"
I'M GONNA FIND THIS GUY.
FACTS ARE THE HALLMARK OF A GOOD FALSE IDENTITY.
IT'S HARDER TO CREATE HISTORY THAN IT IS TO ALTER IT.
"PLUS, THE MORE TRUTH TO YOUR LIE,"
THE EASIER IT IS TO REMEMBER.
"I DON'T SEE YOU FOR WEEKS,"
AND YOU START GOING THROUGH THE CLOSETS?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
WHERE IS THAT BOX YOU USED TO KEEP ALL MY STUFF IN?
THE MEMORY BOX?
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I'M KIDDING.
EXCUSE ME.
"OH, GOD, LOOK, HUH?"
FIRST PLACE.
"GOD, THE TROPHY WAS BIGGER THAN YOU WERE."
"COULD WE SPEED THIS UP, MA?"
I NEED MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
ALL RIGHT.
-Oh!
Alice!
Isn't he a darling?
"- Oh, he's the most adorable thing I've ever seen. -(giggles) l-ls it all right if I pick him up?"
"Oh, sure, go ahead."
"Oh, I've never felt anything so cuddly in my whole life."
- Where'd you get him?
"-Well, Mrs. Manicotti went to the pound today to get a dog for her kids,"
-Mm-hmm.
So I went along with her.
I took one look at this character and I was a goner.
Did you ever see such eyes?
What kind of a dog is he?
"Well, he's a cross between a cocker spaniel"
-and a French poodle.
-Mm.
It's a...
"I guess you'd call it a ""cockerpoodle."""
Mm-hmm.
(cooing)
"Aw, Trixie, you'd better put him back in the box,"
-'cause I got to feed him now.
-All right.
There.
"Get a look at that, ""choice horse meat."""
- Horse meat?
-Uh-huh.
- Ew!
"-Oh, they must know what they're doing, Trix, 'cause the dogs are nuts about it."
Ah.
Is that gonna be enough for him?
"Oh, sure."
I KNOW.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
YOU SHOULD.
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.

Change your mind?
ENOUGH OF THIS.
"YOU WANT A DEAL, YOU DEAL WITH ME."
YOU LEAVE LUCY OUT OF IT.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
"You see, I can be reasonable."
"Of course, I still have a job to do."
And the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or... or -
- I know -
- Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"SHE'S NOT LEAVING TOWN, IS SHE?"
THAT WOULD BE A NO.
Doug:
"IF SHE KNOWS ALL THIS ABOUT YOU,"
SHE'LL PROBABLY COME HERE.
SHE WON'T PLAY THIS OUT ON MY TURF.
SHE'LL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL SHE GETS AN OPENING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
"I'M A CPA,FOR CHRIST'S SAKE."
A CPA BROUGHT DOWN AL CAPONE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDS WANT YOU TO TESTIFY.
I SAY WE HUNT HER DOWN.
- I don't know.
It's OK.
I've got my badges.
- Why?
"- Look, all I know is that... that there was a girl, some stripper who worked in Soho."
"Freddie Lau stole her from Grey, and Grey went mental."
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Stop the machine, I'm dying here!"

I need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of it.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.
And I will not keep my mouth shut.
All right?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar.
- Who's that?
- No-one.

"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"

That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.

JOHN:
"When he was five years old,"
I asked my son Steve what he wanted to be when he grew up.
"""I want to be a cop, Dad, like you."""
I told him to... be anything but that.
STEVE:
"Let's change this out, huh?"
Oh...
I'm sorry.
You all right?
Mm-hmm.
This could've done with some more stitches.
What are you laughing at?
Uh... (laughs)
I was just thinking back to the last time I needed stitches.
All right.
Billy and I were on an operation in Kabul...
Yeah.
"...and, uh,"
I got this nasty cut on the back of my head.
"It was gonna take, like, 15, 20 stitches to close it up, but all we had were Band-Aids."
(chuckles) Yeah.
What'd you do?
Billy just grabbed these huge clumps of hair around the cut and tied them together.
(laughs)
Like a...
First team to the studio.
I gotta go.
I appr eciate your talking.
I can have that time in the 20s?
Check back with me.

"Uh, Judith, this is Isaac Jaff ee, the managing editor."
"Uh, Isaac, this is my fiancée, Judith."

So nice to finally meet you.

"Judith, you ar e charming, and you'r e welcome her e whenever you like."
Thank you.

"This is J.J. 's fiancée, Judith."
-
- Nice to meet you.

- Hi.
Would you give Judith a quick introduction
-- to Dan and Casey bef or e we start?

- Sur e.
I was thinking about what I said earlier.
About what?
About cr eating division between the show and the network.
"I said it's not good f or CSC, it's not good f or the show, it's not good f or Continental Corp,"
"A teenager has his right to get his mac on, Riley Haskell."
It's the law.
- Where's Mr Webb?
- He's sick.
"Look, I gotta go."
I'm really sorry.
The pizza was really good.
Jerk.
"And Precious, make sure you do that thing I told you to do."
- I made a mess.
"- Henri, help me out."
You grab the other side.
"Yeah, we'll just lift this up."
"- Man, I got this."
Grab that.
- You got it?
- That's better.
- Where is he?
Ate the whole box.
- He OD'd on Ding Dongs.
"- Oh, God."
- You okay?
"- We didn't have a choice, man."
- It was for his own good.
- He'll be fine by game time.
Dickie Dunn Jr.
Here with Dickie Dunn III bringing you another exciting season of junior league hockey action.
And this year's first battle is a real David and Goliath matchup.
"Yeah, Dad."
"If David were a Chihuahua, that'd be more like it."
"Yes, that's true, D-III."
It's the defending champ Ice Hounds versus Newman's upstart orphan team calling themselves the Zenovators.
The funeral's over?
"Well, yeah, it happened."
We're getting married.
I told you you look good together.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Now that Nana quit and Yoon-sung's gone...
The Blue House is so boring.
You said all you needed was me to be happy and...
This is why one shouldn't propose too soon.
Take it.
"Mine, too."
Da-hye.
It's OK if you're too busy to come to the wedding.
I'll text you my account number.
I wish you health and happiness.
Choi Eung-chan.
"Be happy, Eun-ah."
"Ma am, how about... we open a restaurant in the States?"
We can name it Delicious Korean.
What did the ex-president say?
"He's sorry, grateful, and he wished me happiness."
You know...
I was a chef on a ship once.
I love Korean food.
It's amazing.
The Americans need to taste my food.
I'll be famous.

Thank you for watching City Hunter.
I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."
You talk to me about truth...

We're never gonna march again.
"I'm broke, josie."
Jim fisk is busted.
I'm right back where i started.
"Jim... don't worry about me, josie."
I'm all right.
"I was just laughing to think that for the first time in his life, nick was smarter than i was."
And i thought i was bigger than anybody else.
"Don't you worry, josie."
You've got yours.
See how smart i was to make you take all those things i gave you?

"NOW,DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT?"
I DON'T THINK SO.
"NOW,BE HONEST WITH ME."

NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.
"MAYBE THE NEXT ONE,THEN."
THE INDICTMENTS CAME DOWN YESTERDAY.
THAT WAS QUICK.

- Yeah.
"I thought we could chat for, say, 10 or 15 minutes."
John.
- I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?
"- No,you can't."
- I booked you a flight.

"It leaves Dulles for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45."
I tried to get you on the one to

I couldn't help thinking... this isn't real.
I can stop this.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.

Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"

You're 11.

He's good.
So go ahead.
Tell me to go fuck myself.
Tell me what a fucking bitch I am

"I don't know how it works yet, but..."
- Yeah.
That's not how.
- Yeah.
"Wait, so now you're on board to hunt?"
I thought you weren't really down for it.
Yeah.
"Yeah, but fish aren't animals."
They're like the rodents of the sea.
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.
Bing!
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.

Not an office.
You're Deputy Special Agent Finnerty?
"Oh, you're Jenna's favour."
This is Emily.
"This is Em, my daughter."
My father is a very special man.
It's nice to meet you.
I paid her to say that.
- Let's get started.
- Okay.
I don't know.
Just...
"Sorry, I gotta ask."
"You didn't marry Jim Finnerty from Sigma Chi, did you?"
- That guy was--
- An asshole.
"Yes, he was."
"This is my colleague, Special Agent Todd."
Standard Secret Service protocol requires a two-agent review for every interview.
You're not to look at Agent Todd.
"- I'm sorry, I just looked at him."
- You're only to look at me.
So we just-
- Okay.
The subject is John Cale.
"Born 1980, grew up in the District of Columbia graduated Hill High in 1999."
Looks like you've bounced from job to job.
"Mechanic, limo driver, construction."
Is my credit score in there?
"Yes, and you should be ashamed of yourself."
"It's a recession, okay?"
Married Melanie Schopp in 2002 and had a child six months later.
Filed for divorce in 2005.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"You were the only Laxmi, Who was my last hope,"
"And If you betrays me, then what will happen with me?"
Think about it.
"Kill me, Kill me, Please, I want to go up."
"Kill me, Laxmi!"
"Leave me,"
"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."
Who told you?
"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."
One minute.
"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.
"He is not, He stands next to me."
You people come soon here.
I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
Carl.
Carl?
Carl.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no."
Someone's taken Carl's brain!
That is what I've been trying to tell you.
Really?
"Well, you haven't been very specific about it!"
I know I haven't.
"Because they says if I tell anyone,"
I'm gonna lose my job dancing in front of the car wash.
"Well, I'll tell you what, we're gonna do something about it right now."
"Look here, we can keep this cool, between us 'cause, look, this the third job I lost this week."
Come on y'all.
We're gonna go get us a car wash.
Are you outta your mind?
They take your brain out!
I know that!
They take your brain out over there.
"Here, I got a coupon."
"That's okay, Carl."
I got the employee discount.
Free triple foam polish with UV protectorant.
"Come on, Shake."
I'm trying to create a show here.
I'm a show.
What time the show come on?
Brain:
"Brain Slave, report to Brain Quarters."
"Brain Slave, kindly report to Brain Quarters."
Brain Slave!
The new Brain Slave refuses to report!
Ain't nothing but a brain.
"As are we, Son."
And we do our job!
"You right, Daddy."
You right!
"Go on and fetch this Brain Slave, and kindly ask him to be on bug removal!"
Permanently!
"Customer, Daddy!"
Get my blue fright wig at once!
"Greet them with a smile, Son."
A hard plastic smile.
"We got a free dashboard cleaning, get the lint balls off your car, free tire shine!"
You'll get all that with a free brain removal.
Carl Brain:
"Moron, don't tell them!"
I meant to say car wash.
Now gas them!
Quickly!
"Look, I just came by to tell you that I've told the police about your little brain operation here."
"Yeah, and they didn't believe us."
"No, they didn't."
Then we shall call them and show them pictures!
"That's a good idea, Daddy."
It is a very good idea.
Where's Carl's brain?
I am Carl Brain.
"No, Carl's Brain."
I am Carl Brain.
"No, no, no."
"Different carl, okay?"
I am Carl Brain.
I will take this further if you wish.
"- It's over, as far as I'm concerned."
"- Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne?"
"Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure."
"Oh, excuse me."
You didn't come back.
"The shore, The Far Rock."
I walk there every day.
"That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there."
"The lough, this place, it's for everyone."
"You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to..."
You're not welcome here.
Surely to God you know that.
"I just got posted, sir, all right?"
I'm due to depart for England real soon.
I just wanted one last drink with my pal here.
"Michael, let him in."
The lad's off to do his duty.
Go on.
One!
Noches!
"Hey, Noches!"
"Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney?"
Noches!
He went home a while ago.
- Mr. Coyne.
- Lieutenant.
"I'm, er, you know, I'm, er,"
"I'm really sorry for what happened, sir."
I-I didn't mean any harm.
"Go home while you're still ahead, son."
Good luck to you.
"I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy."
Heather!
Daddy does those things to Mommy.
Okay.
Yeah.
_
Yeah.
Lark just would not stop crying today.
- Yeah.
"- And 45 minutes later,"
I found out her shoe was on too tight.
How am I supposed to know that?
"I know, it's gonna be so much easier when she can talk."
"Like, we won't feel like we're, like, on a Japanese game show we don't know the rules to."
Hey.
- Is that Sam?
- Yeah.
"Hey, Sam, what's up?"
"Hey, Uncle Greg."
"Move, you're blocking the view."
"Oh, of what?"
"Oh, the security guard stuck against the wall on a Segway?"
"No, we're spying on my boyfriend."
You have a boyfriend?
Irving Rosenblatt... he's the coolest boy in the class.
He's been acting weird.
I'm not even sure if we're boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
He liked three of Lexie's pictures on Instagram.
"Oh, I hate her."
Unless you're Lexie.
"No, I'm Jenna."
Lexie's a monster.
"Hello, this is Kim Na Na."
What... me?
I'm qualified?
"Yes, thank you!"
"First of all, welcome to Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House)."
But...
"Don't assume that by coming into Cheong Wa Dae, (Note:"
Cheong Wa Dae
- Blue House) you can afford to slack off and relax.
You must give 100 percent and do your best.
Who are you?
How can a security officer be late on his first day of work?
Why are you dressed up like that?
I'm not a bodyguard.
"Then, who are you?"
They told me to come here.
Dr. Lee!
You're here.
This shameless person has a doctorate?
The National group of communication network is not here.
You have to go to the next building.
"Oh, it's the guy with a doctorate from MIT!"
MIT?
You are... 10 000 Won?
I'm right?
"So, you are a Blue House security guard."
No wonder you're so strong!
Do you know each other?
- Yes.
- No.
He has come a long way... he got his phd from MIT.
He has achieved a lot and he is only 28 years old!
He's in a hospital in Miami.
"He had a stroke, but recovered okay."
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him.
That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What?
Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
"Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia."
"Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods."
But you don't even send a dress to my house.
No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
Yeah!
"Yeah, yeah, kid, she's hot as a torch, but you don't know anything about her."
- I know plenty.
- Yeah?
Where's she from?
Somewhere else.
Why'd she leave?
Who cares?
"Her past doesn't matter, long as her future's with me."
"Oh, Petey, ever since this girl came to town, you got a dream in your head where your sense ought to be."
"- You know what, Dad?"
- What?
You're right.
Petey...
"I love you, Nicky Johnson."
Marry me.
Marcy came to see me.
She's fine.
Thought you'd like to know that.
Why didn't you bring her home?
She's 18.
"She's still my little girl, Agent Kelton."
"I'm sorry about that, but there was nothing I could do."
What we need to talk about is Curtis McNeal.
"Yeah, I just heard."
It's terrible.
"So what aren't you telling me, Senator?"
Excuse me?
"Look, I've worked a lot of kidnaps, but this one's different."
"They're trying to get to you, and they're trying to get to me."
Why?
I have no idea.

So what's going on?
"All right, so there's this girl here tonight"

- Same with me.
"Oh, that's great!"
Perfect wingman situation.
"Two bros, two babes--"
"Yeah, it's the same girl."
"Ohh, that is less great."
Her name's Kim.
She's new at our school.
"I'm really into her, so I asked Pete to go talk to her"
- and find out her situation.
- So I did.
"I went up and asked her if she had a boyfriend, and she said, ""I do now,"" and then she winked at me."
- Traitor!

Very obvious.

Just think.
This is our chance to get our big break.
I think a crazy plan is coming our way.
"If we can just get the song to Livi, she'll help launch my career."
I'll be rich and famous.
"And what happened to ""us""?"
"We're a band, remember?"
"Yeah, what good is fame if you don't have your friends?"
That's just it.
We'll all be famous.
As if.
What do you want?
Me'?
"Oh, nothing."
It's just so much fun listening to you guys think you could be pop stars.
We've got a better chance than you.
"Oh, please."
She's like a guy.
What more could you ask for?
- I'm telling her I'm with you.
- No.
"Michael, what are you doing?"
Don't tell her you're out with me.
"No, I'm gonna screw it up."
I can't lie.
You're both gonna hate me forever.
Leave me out of it.
- I have faith in you.
- No.
Come here.
Michael.
Come here.
"Michael, Michael."
"Hey, Michael, come here a second."
My boss said to tell you that there's this guy who really wants to buy this thing coming by tomorrow.
But he is full of shit.
"I mean, I've worked here for three years."
You're the first people I ever showed it to.
"Smoked a lot of weed in there, though."
It's good for that.
- Hello.
"- Izzy, your father, he isn't breathing."
You need to get home quickly.
Okay.
I called the ambulance and the fire volunteers.
I gotta go.
Chris is moving into Kenny's?
"I think so, so they can, like, figure some stuff out."
I don't get it.
It's been the same for about 30 years.
Ah.
I need to be alone.
"Hi, I've brought a bottle."
I didn't know if that was...
I'm not really sure what the rules are.
APPLAUSE
"Hello, I'm Alan Davies and this is As Yet Untitled."
"It's a conversation between four guests and me, in which we will try to come up with the title of the show."
"It's not rocket science, unless that's what we decide to call it... so please will you welcome, my guests."
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
"Hello, hello."
Hiya.
Hello.
"Hello, everyone."
"So, now let's introduce you all."
Shappi Khorsandi is here.
Shappi Khorsandi has been bailed out by Nanny McPhee.
Shappi's here.
SHAPPI MOUTHS
APPLAUSE
Jack Dee.
Welcome to Jack.
Jack Dee was described by a fire chief as a hero and was once involved in extreme sports.
"Jack Dee, everyone."
APPLAUSE
Matthew Crosby.
"Nice to see you, Matthew."
"Earlier this year, he didn't go to see Morrissey."
"Thank you, Matthew, that's what I like to hear."
APPLAUSE
And I'm delighted to welcome Julian Clary.
"All right, here he is."
"Bull, the Battling Bailiff."
Ta-da.
Well?
What do you think?
"Spiffy, real spiffy."
It's the first time I ever bought off the rack.
"Bull, it's almost time."
"Boy. is this great or is this great, huh, Bull?"
"Center ring, 20,000 screaming fans."
This has to be the greatest night of your life.
Where's Selma?
"Oh, traffic out there is so bad and--"
"She's not coming, is she?"
"No, Bull, she isn't."
"Bruiser, you're on."
-How do you feel?
-Like I'm gonna throw up.
lGAGS]
All the great ones do.
Bull I believe it was the Apostle Paul who said that:
"""Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen."""
"Now, go out there and rip his lips off."
MAC:
"Go get them, Bull."
-You can do it.
Whoo.
Did you see that arena out there?
Twenty thousand drooling maniacs at 12 bucks a head.
-We're going to be rolling in it.
-We?
"Yeah, I dumped that whole condo scam, I put all of my money into Bull."
And then what?
"The old bag, fit for Ziegfeld Follies."
Aglaé!
To keep her happy I should have been equipped with the obelisk of Luxor.
- Mary
- I'm speechless!
- What are you up to?
I didn't hear you come in.
This gentleman let me in.
- Will you join us in the lounge?
- I'm heading for the kitchen.
Idiot.
André's got guts.
He does love me.
I'm sure he prefers me to his mother.
I share him so I can act better in the play.
Do you understand?
You've no right to judge me!
You've got too much fog in your head for that!
At last!
It's okay.
He's clean.
"Hey, St. Fruitcake, do you have news from Mickey for Mary?"
- I don't know where he is.
- Same as Mary...
You've come to join the winning team?
I've been telling you that he would find me.
He's my puppy.
Like my sweet little brother!
He knows about tomorrows.
"I'll give you your tomorrows, but hands off my today!"
"Mary got back her ticket, but for a price."
Going out with Alice?
Where's Henry?
"Uh, I don't know."
Alice probably called him.
We'll probably meet up.
Probably?
It's not a big deal.
Are you leaving out Henry for some reason?
No.
You and Alice dating?
Got plans to sleep with her again?
Dad!
No.
"We are not dating, exactly."
And I do not have plans to sleep with her.
"But if that were going to happen, you wouldn't have Henry around."
"Oh, I'll call Henry."
Henry doesn't know you slept with Alice?
No.
He does not.
And I'd like to forget that ever happened and so would Alice.
Let me make a suggestion.
"Hang out with Henry, or Henry and Alice, not just Alice."
You slept with her.
She's not just a friend.
"Geez, Dad, what is going on here?"
What is going on here is I think you might be sneaking around trying to see Dylan.
Where did that come from?
I'll tell you where it came from.
Dylan's father.
"He called me asking about Henry, if I know Henry."
Dylan's going out with Henry tonight.
"Good night, beautiful."
Good night.
"Doctor, it's so nice of you to come."
My pleasure.
"And, Mrs. Comstock, what a heavenly gown."
How sweet.
Thank you.
"I believe you know Margo Stevens, Doctor and Mrs. Comstock."
- How do you do?
"- How do you do, Miss Stevens?"
"Margo is one of my husband's little golf partners, you know."
It's a shame you've never played yourself.
"Oh, you'd be surprised how much I know about the game."
Now be a dear and get Dr. and Mrs. Comstock a drink
"- for me, will you?"
- Thank you.
"You must come out some time, Mrs. Langley, and give me lessons."
Psst.
Danny.
"Danny, I was afraid you weren't going to come to my party."
I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world.
My bags are packed.
Everybody'll be squishy by 11.
We can sneak out then.
"We'll drive, Danny."
Anywhere in the world.
11:00.
Anywhere in the world.
"Meet me out at the old garage-- the one behind the gardener's shed, the back road."
I love you.
[fizzing]
"Hello, Howard."
Okay?
Go for Dr. Baskets.
"Dale, I need you to run an errand for me tomorrow."
"That is a giant no, Mother."
I am knee deep in lazy teachers.
Knee deep!
- Woman:
Excuse me?
"- I said I am knee deep in lazy teachers, you witch!"
"Dale, I think you owe me."
You and your brother ruined my house.
You wrecked the whole place.
"Mother, I texted you an apology already."
What else do you want me to do?
I gotta go.
Bye.
Dale...
"Oh, you brat."

- [Laughing] - [Cell phone rings]
Yes.
"Oh, hold on one second."
Can you hold this for a second?
"Hi, Mom."
"Chip, I'm out of town, and I need you to do something for me tomorrow."
"Yeah, yeah, okay, for sure."
"Meemaw has a doctor's appointment tomorrow, there's a reminder on the fridge."
Can you do that for me?
"So, does that mean that you're not mad at me anymore?"
- Don't push it.
"- Okay, that's good enough, 'cause it's anchored to my skivvies."
You can have a seat.
And we'll see who's full of what.
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Pick one.
Truth.
Who do you think sent the postcard?
- I don't know.
- I want your honest opinion.
"Honestly, I don't know."
Big bastard!
Let's try that again.
"In your honest opinion, who among the people gathered here do you think is most likely... to have sent the postcard?"
Chris.
"Oh... oh, Gem."
"I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to say."
"Well, she doesn't know, Justin."
She's saying it because she's scared.
Gemma dumped Chris because of Felix.
- Maybe he wanted revenge.
- That's ridiculous.
While we were driving you just said you wanted to hit him.
"- Yeah, I wanna hit everyone!"
- Did you send the postcard?
I did not.
Fuck!
Wait.
What was... what was the postmark?
What was the date on the card?
"7th September, London."
"I was in fucking Spain, you tossers, three whole weeks."
"Paul, Paul, you can vouch for me."
The first week of September I couldn't go to the lakes because I was in Spain.
"He's right, he was in Spain."
- That's it!
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
"Thank you, King."
"Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years."
It's the least I could do.
"Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit."
"Thanks, dear."
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
"We're, like, your biggest fans!"
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
"- OK, girls, that's it."
"- We love you, Lightning!"
"Hey, buddy."
You're one gutsy racer.
"Oh, hey, Mr. The King."
You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
- Really?
"Oh, that..."
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
"- This ain't a one-man deal, kid."
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.
"You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should."
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
Yeah...
Ka-chow!
You have company.
Just texting my girlfriends.
It's time for me to leave.
"Oh, It's only 9:00."
"We could have some coffee, watch a movie."
More cake?
"Oh, the cake was awesome."
"But really, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so, Dylan, do you want to walk me to the door?"
"Go ahead, Dylan."
Go ahead.
Of course.
What are you doing?
Ben has been waiting for hours.
"Oh, I doubt it."
You doubt it?
"Okay, let me rephrase that."
I don't care.
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.
And I did see you first at that party and I am really smitten with you.
And I'm angry with myself for stepping aside for my friend.
You slept with Ben's wife that night.
"Yeah, I did."
"And it was a huge mistake, huge."
"But stepping aside, huger mistake."
He doesn't deserve you.
He's in love with Amy.
"He's always been in love with Amy, so don't waste your time."
And I hope you'll give me a chance.
"Good night, Robert."
"Good night, Cecilia."
BOTH:
- He can find himself another hit man.
- I'm sure.
- I'll tell if you tell me.
- No!
"OK, kids, lunch is ready!"
You should get yourself a new map.
No.
This is my only school prize.
- The names are out of date.
- I know.
The old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you want to know?
How did you get out so early?
Where are you living?
What are you gonna do with your life?
I'm out on licence.
I'm living in a kind of halfway house.

"- I don't know, Jess."
I need some more time on that one.
- Is that it?
- Course it's not it.
- I did it for you.
- No.
I killed them for you.
- You did it for yourself.
"- Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you and you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again?
- Shh!
- Shh!
- They found Sally.
- Mm-hmm.
"Atta girl, Sally."
"By tonight, the entire world's gonna hear how well you're breathing."
"Hi, I'm Jack Dane."
This is Mike Makula.
- Hi.
- We're from the Wameru Center.
I'm Captain Stedman from the consulate.
"This is Sergeant McEvoy, and Dr. Alison, our scientific attaché."
How do you do?
Doctor.
We're with the search party.
"Well, thanks very much for your help, gentlemen, but as you can see, we were fortunate enough to have already found Sally."
- Can we see her?
- Sure.
"It's all right, Sergeant."
"Hello, Sall--"
I don't believe it.
That's not Sally.
That's Judy.
She's our chimp.
You gotta be kidding.
Of course it's Judy.
She's our compound pet.
"Gentlemen, you are sadly mistaken."
"Look, she's wearing an authentic NASA space helmet."
"Now, if she weren't Sally, what would she be doing with that helmet?"
"Well, that's a tough thing to answer, but believe me, you are making a mistake."
"Please, young man, we've got no time for jokes."
"-Yes, sir."
-You got the cigars?
"-Yes, sir."
"Now, you boys have done a darn good job."
"Uh, uh..."
what's your number again?
"-Uh, 43, sir."
-43.
-Your number?
"-27, sir."
27.

We're going to have a big-time reunion-- my old squad coming.
-Yes...
"-These poor souls never lived before, like I'm going to show 'em."
"-Look, uh..."
"-Yes, sir."
No reason why I can't shack 'em up here.
No use in them getting a room.
"What the management don't know won't hurt 'em, you know?"
"-Get that stuff out of the bag, will you, kid?"
"-Yes, sir."
I tell you what I have to have done.
A lot of things have to be done real quick.

"I only have three backup trays of those pigs in a blanket, okay?"
"Okay, you need to relax 'cause this is way too many apps."

Bruce's girlfriend.
What's her name again?
- Nancy.
"- Yeah, she's probably, like, a out of work temp with a terrible bob and rosacea."
"I'm sure she's very sweet, okay?"
And I would just like her to feel welcome in my home.
A lesser woman might be freaked out about meeting their ex-husband's new girlfriend.
- Not this old gal.
- Nope?
"I'm very happy for them, and I think it's gonna be good for all of us."
Every bit of it has been skewed and twisted.
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.
It has to be her.
Hi-yah!

I don't want you near those horses again.
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.
Let's go.
"We can't let this happen, Ty."
All those beautiful horses.
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.

You're not as warm as Yoon Jae.
That's a relief.
Since I want to be cool.
Let's go now.

I... grabbed his hand!
What?
In the water...
I thought I was going to die...
But Seo Yoon Jae reached out his hand towards me.
If I were to live...
I thought I should go towards him...
So I grabbed onto his hand.
I wonder...
If that's why I came in this body?
If the switch happened because you and Yoon Jae grabbed hands...
"Do you think if you held hands again, you two will switch back?"
What if he doesn't wake up?
I'm sure he'll wake up!
Hurry up and grab it.
It's amazing.

Oh you can get that.

But you can get that.
Sorry.

Just 2 seconds.
Hey!
Um yeah I'm still here.
Um sure that's fine.
"Wait, you didn't really just do what I think you just did, did you?"
Because I kind of had plans to just spend the night with you.
Um she's outside.
How did she get my address?

"He wasrt at his house last night and he wasrt there this morning, and they just told me at his office that they don't know when he's gonna be in, so I was wondering if, you know,"
I thought maybe somebody here would have an idea where he might be.
"Yes, this is about Claire, isn't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.

Come on.

- Get out of here.
- Get out or we'll give it to you too.

Go to the pen?
You can't get away with this.
Go back there and put out that fire.

- You're playing into Thompson's hands.
- He'll hang you for this.
- Thompson's dead.
Thompson's dead?
"- Yeah, we took care of him."
"- Listen, kids, you gotta stop where you are."
Whatever you do will be another rap to beat.

- You think I ran out on you?
I didn't.
"- Sure, you ran out."
You ran.
Go on.
I didn't.
I meant to come back the day after I left.
I got into a fight and shot a rat.
I think I killed him.
I'm on the lam now.

It was underneath the floor mat.
"Bullshit, man."

"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?
"Floyd, New York."
"Like Clyde, New Jersey."
Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
After law school I headed where?
"Floyd, New York."
Washington.
Leapfrogged from staffer to congressional assistant until the mayor of New York City came down to testify.
And he gave a speech that day that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
You're trouble you know that Cece.
What afraid you're going to fall in love?
OK you have got to stop it with the winks.
She winks?
All the time.
Becca is a winker.
Becca's a wanker?
"No not a wanker, a winker."
She winks.
I only do it to guys I think are cute Ok?
It's for this movie I'm doing it's a character role.
So what are you guys doing afterwards?
Ah home.
I've got to work early in the morning.
"Whoa, whoa lame excuse."
Excuse me can we get six tequila shots please?
Top shelf?
- Yeah.
"Oh no, no that is trouble."
I puke.
I'll clean it up.
Ah count yourself lucky you even got he out.
She's always in bed by 10PM.
Just this one night.
Ah I would but I really should go.
Me either.
I have an interview with a wedding planner in the morning.
I have an audition at nine.
I have casting.
I'm free.
I'll stay.
Ok well I'll let you off the hook this one time OK.
"Bob, what's the matter with you?"
"If they catch you here, the two of us will be thrown out of school."
You mean the three of us.
I saw him come in here.
You saw who come in here?
"Your boyfriend, Wilbur."
(NANCY CHUCKLING)
"What's wrong with you, darling?"
"Oh, save your ""darlings"" for Wilbur."
"I tell you, at this moment, Wilbur is in his room sound asleep."
He's not here?
He's not here.
He's in his room sound asleep?
He's in his room sound asleep.
"Okay, I'm gonna find out."
You do that.
Good evening.
(MUMBLING)
We're delighted that you both could come.
We were happy to come.
"Would you excuse me, please?"
Certainly.
Enjoy yourselves.
I've been trying to see you all day.
I locked my windows.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You can figure that out for yourself.
(ALL APPLAUDING) Maybe Wilbur can help me.
"Bob, I don't know what's come over you lately."
You've just got to stop picking on Wilbur!
"Bob, what are you waiting for?"
What?
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Hey!
Cynthia!
Thank God.
Thank God that is over!
"I mean, who jumps out of the canoe?"
You could have really hurt yourself out there!
Put these on.
Cynthia?
"Jason, I have had it!"
I can't do everything exactly the way you want!
I can't control the ocean and row the boat and stop the waves!
Calm down!
And I can't do anything about the fact that I can't get pregnant!
This is nuts.
"No, it's me."
And I just really need some time right now.
"Please stop following me, 'cause I need to be away from you."
Come on.
What are you doing?
"Hey, hey, where you going?"
That's a jungle!
You know what?
"I'm gonna go check on her, okay?"
"Great, thank you."
"Yeah, you guys go ahead."
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.
"Honey, I don't think it's a good idea that everyone separates right now."
I really don't think we have a choice.
Let me just go talk to her.
"No, Jason, she really needs a minute, okay?"

"♪ this is how I want it, this is what I like ♪"
Wow.
I can't remember the last time
I did it missionary style.
That is one of the top two moments of my whole life.
The other was with Stephen Hawking.
"Oh, we didn't do this."
I just met him.
"♪ This is how I want it, this is what I like ♪"
- Morning Ri.
- Hey Sara.
"So, how are things going with Dr. Lonsdale?"
Eh.
What?
What does that mean?
Meh.
Okay.
What are these sounds?
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
He just did something before we had sex that turned me off.
- Maybe he was trying to be considerate.
- Yeah.
But then he did something after we had sex that really turned me off.
This is bad.
"This is very, very bad."
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry about it.
Everett and I have zero chemistry together.
"I guarantee you, he feels exactly the same way I do."
"18 year old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"

"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows!"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Supermac 98!
You've been found out.
You're done!
What shall I do?
"Only the Commissioner's fiancee, who can save you."
But I don't want to see her again.
This is an order.
Go immediately!
Why are you here?
You remember what you said to me yesterday?
I don't remember.
But I do. I remember it too well.
You said you'll never see me again.
I was just joking.
I don't mean what I say.
"But you said you love me, do you mean it?"
Of course I do.
I need you help.
My help?
To go after some girl?
Can't you even get Dumplings on your own?
All I want is to get the 'Beast'.
But Hiroshima has escaped and identified me.
I was told that only you can help me out.

"Yeah, yeah, get over it."
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Truth, probably."
"- ""Um, truth, probablah."""
- Truth it is.
Be nice.
"So, Felix... tell me... if you had a golden ticket... and you could pick any girl... or any guy... to take upstairs for a very quick, no strings attached, no questions asked shag... who would it be?"
"In fact, here... it is."
"Your ""free shag"" ticket."
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
"Who is it, Felix?"
"Who's the lucky girl, Felix?"
I'm sorry.
"I want to play, I want to play, come on."
"Come on, let's play, Truth or Dare, bitch?"
You and me.
"Put your knob away, Chris, we're just mucking about."
- Truth.
Do I look like a muck to you?
- No.
- So why're you pissing on my patch?
- I was just...
"- Ahem, I was just playing..."
"- ""I was just-just..."""
- just playing the game.
"- Oh, just playing..."
"- You fancy your chances, do you?"
- No.
No?
"Well, we better find out what's on offer, then."
- I think Gem should know.
We're doing this my way.
"Ah, yeah, 'cause it's your way or the highway."
"Oh, God."
Not the highway.
You always want me to be his dad.
"Well, I'm being his dad."
"Oh, uh, I-I'm really scared, Jay."
This is what we're fixing.
"Look, when I was a kid,"
"I lived by a big, scary black lake."
I always thought there monsters in there and whatnot.
"One night, my dad dragged me out of bed and tossed me right in that cold water."
I was never scared of that lake again.
"Now, give it some gas."
- Mama!
- Aah!
"That's another habit I wouldn't mind breaking, but, you know, right now we... have to..."
"Oh, what am I doing?"
I hated my dad for that.
"I ended up scared of him, not the lake."
"Manny, it's okay."
Over there!
On the bike!
The white guy that stole my phone!
I don't see anyone.
Yes!
He just turned the corner!

He's getting away!
Not this time.

What are you doing up at this hour?
"I don't know, I'm just kind of worried."
"Well, I'm worried about you not getting enough sleep."
"Go to bed, honey."
Sweet dreams.
"Leave, leave, leave!"
I don't know what you think you saw!

"Speaking of youth, last night's snow storm has caused a rash of school closings"
- in the Quint City area.
- Here we go!
The following schools are closed:
"Abraham Lincoln Elementary, John F. Kennedy High School,"
"Robert F. Kennedy High School, Martin Luther King Middle School,"
- Sharon Tate Elementary...
- Where's our school?
"- Come on, come on!"
"- Anton Cermak Tech,"
"Medgar Evers Center for Creative Non-Violence,"
"Archduke Franz Ferdinand School of Cosmetology, Huey Long High..."
- Would you use it?
Of course.
If necessary.
Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him.
He loves you very much.
I love him.
"But, darling, you don't show it."
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
Don't be afraid now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid of?
"I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I?"
And swim with him and play football with him.
- David...
"- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?"
"To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke."
I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I can manage alone.
I can't.
"David, I need you."
- I love you.
- Don't.
"Please, don't."
I want to sleep.
"For God's sake, let me sleep."
Thank you.
You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden?
"No, sir."
Not since Billy Parkin lived here.
"Wal, you're living in a bubble."
"Mate, those seats are gone."
They're rooted.
And I don't mean that in a nice way.
That's the status quo.
We're not married.
Every year they hold the State party conference in a different place.
That's usually a lot of fun for the wives.
"You know, my Joe's got his eye on your David."
Why?
Is he gay?
"Oh, I don't know what he is sexually."
I'm just married to him.
(Women laugh)
"Wendy, Wendy, stop yelling."
Thank you.
"Listen, Wendy!"
Just don't speak to John Bartrop.
Do not speak to him.
"There's no point in speaking to Bartrop, OK?"
Leave the school out of it.
I'll talk to Fuzz.
Leave it to me.
I'll talk to him and Mrs Robinson.
Yeah.
Who's John Bartrop?
"A puff of air in a mohair cardigan, and my new name of choice for telemarketers and Mormons."
Right.
Bang!
"The first cut gets him there, and then he's down, he's dead."
"And then bang, bang, bang, three symmetrical wounds there."
And then...
"I mean, what do we got ourselves?"
"A ""thinner"" sitch here?"
Slim Jim might not even know.
Hm.
[ Knock on door ]
Hi.
I believe you have something of mine.
Kill Wayne?
I loved him!
Dean:
So...you were...
Yes.
Okay?
"We were having an affair -- for years, actually."
"I don't mean to be rude, uh..."
But how is it that Wayne McNut is your type?
"I mean, you're married to a man who's barely a buck -- wet."
What can I say?
Sometimes it's nice to feel a little give.
Oh.
"Yeah, I get that -- a little extra cushion for the, uh..."
Help me understand something.
"If you loved Wayne, why did you put a curse on him?"
It wasn't a curse.
Putsi bags are also used for blessings.
I wanted Wayne to win.

"Plan was, take the prize money, get a quickie divorce, and then tie the knot in Orlando."

"Oh, I can't take it, oh..."
"Oh, why's Beerus-sama coming here?"
Ka... me... ha... me... ha....
That was a nice one.
You idiot.
Tell me before you go firing that everywhere.
That ain't good...
"Give us some thought sometimes, won't you?"
Sorry about that...
I just wanna train and get stronger...
Really now...
That's exactly why I don't want you and Beerus-sama to meet.
Huh?
Who's Beerus-sama?
"Oh, I'm such an idiot, an idiot, an idiot."
You really were hiding' somethin' from me.
So that's why you were actin' so weird.
Is that guy a human?
He's not human.
He's a god.
He's on about the same level as the Kaioshin-sama.
And he's headed this way.
"But if he's a god, that shouldn't be a problem, should it?"
"He's a fickle and incredibly fearsome god, you see."
A fearsome god?
"He governs over the destruction in the universe, and... destroys planets and lifeforms at the slightest peeve."
"- So, what happens to her?"
- I was just gonna ask that.
- She probably dies.
"- Now, that's cool."
"- No, that's depressing."
"- Oh, I give up."
Excuse me.
- (quietly):
What's going on?
"- Christy, I can't do this."
You should just take her home with you.
No.
I already have a daughter I screwed up.
This one's yours.
But it's so awkward.
I have nothing in common with her.
So what?
"She needs a home, she doesn't need a buddy."
"I know, but I really want her to like me."
Then you shouldn't have signed up to be a mom.
"Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?"
We might have to take you up on that.
Let's see how the banana bread goes.
"Oh, great."
Now I don't know what you're talking about.
"Christy, this was a mistake."
"When people don't like me at first, they never like me."
I don't have a chance with her.
That's not true.
I didn't like you at first.
You didn't?
Nope.
"- Boys, boys."
"Boys, stop."
It's the truth.
I swear Patsy's telling you the truth.
"I'm willing to take my chances, see this thing through."
We're in the same boat.
I'm not leaving here until they come and take me.
"If there's quitting to be done, you're gonna do it."
Don't be chumps.
Don't let them pin anymore on you.
We've got a rap to beat.
The way to start beating it is by putting out that fire.
"Now, what do you say?"
Do we do it?
"Jim, Butch, Mac, do we do it?"
"Casey, what do you say?"
"- Okay, come on."
- Come on.
Come on--
"- So that's it, eh, Charlie?"
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, you can go."
There's no doubt that this tragedy was Thompson's own fault.
"- You agree, coroner?"
- The sheriff and I both agree.
"Mr. Gargan, I owe you a sincere apology."
"Oh, forget it."
"Hey, wait a minute."
They can't do nothing to him.
The guy's gonna be okay.
"Besides, he pulled a gun on Patsy."
- Shut up.
Hey...
"I'll pay these guys back, I'll be back here"
"- in an hour, tops."
- Griffin...
"I'll come back here Sandy, we'll call Dad."
We will work this out as a family OK?
I promise you.
"Hey, it's Griff."
You know the drill.
"Hey, Griffin."
"It's me, your father."
I just want you to know that I love you.
And that we all make mistakes.
"You're responsible for your actions, I'm not saying you're not, but"
I want you to know that you're not alone; you have me and your sisters and even your mom.
I got you your job back.
I know it's not...
"It's not the best, but you know, maybe you're doing some good there and we're there for you, and... um, you can..."
"So just call me OK, just call me please."
"Would you do that, please?"
"And you're not alone, Griffin."
You're not alone.
- Long night?
- Yup.
- We should sleep.
Talk later.
- No.
Talk now.
OK.

I ain't going back.

Or you're going back up.
"Any police contact, you're going back up."
"Drug test come back positive,"
You're going back.
What am I telling you this for?
"You know all this shit, right?"
Yeah...
"I mean, yes."
I don't know if I believe you.
Do you believe you?
"That's what matters, right?"
"All right, get out my face and go get a job."
See you next Tuesday.
"Thank you, sir."
"Yo, let's go kid, you taking forever."

"(Woman) No, he ain't violate."
"So what, you love him?"
"I mean, he do be calling me his wifey and shit, so..."
How can you say that after what happened to you?
- That kid's dead.
- Dean.
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?
"Sammy, look at yourself."
If dad was here...
He's not.
"Well, I am!"
And as soon I'm finished with that dick...
"Shut up, okay?"
!
I don't need your help.
"That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean."
I want to be normal.
So taking a beating -- that's normal?
Any word from dad?
"He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
Um...
I'll wait for you outside.
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."

"Look, Betty, this is so terrible, I don't know where to begin."
Tell her.
"Betty, the graduation dance is off."
She hung up.
What a fine graduation.
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?
Allison MacKenzie.
Her mother kicked me out of the house for kissing her.
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.
"Quality's a very good thing in woolen cloth, but it's very dull on a big date."
"I didn't know you were such a good dancer, Allison."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Hi, Rod."
"- Hi there, Allison."
"Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?"
"After the dance, shall we go to Rockland?"
Okay.
"Oh, really?"
"- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"May I have this dance, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"I haven't danced for such a long time, I'm afraid I'd be terrible."
"- It""s okay."
- What am I gonna do?
"You are gonna lay in bed and you""re gonna cry your little eyes out."
"Then you""re gonna get up... you""re gonna put on a smile and go find those babies."
"And you""re gonna tell them, ""Mama""s here and everything is fine and dandy."""
"But he""s already filed for divorce."
"He wants the house, the cars."
"He thinks I""m having an affair with a woman."
- I have never cheated on my husband.
- I know that.
"- But he""ll win anyway?"
"- No, he won""t."
"- He""ll take my kids."
"- I won""t let him."
"- L""ll fight with you as long as it takes."
- It is too late.
He has pictures.
"Oh, my."
Who would take pictures like that?
"We took those pictures, Jesse."
"We""re knee-deep into this."
Let me see that camera.
Hurry up.
"- Jesse, what""s the matter with you?"
"- L""m sorry."
"Sorry doesn""t cut it."
Not for Pam Caine.
Hand me the binoculars.
"Jesse, you never get over something like this."
Never.
"Go see if the camera""s broken."

- Fine.

Let him know that.

Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
"Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
"You know, I'm like in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
-What should I say anyway?
-Just talk to your daddy.
Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling.
I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?
He's not going to answer you.
"Talk to your daddy, honey."
I don't know what to say.
"Well, let's see."
First we....
No....
Wait.
I don't know.
-Tell him about Washington.
-Okay.
"You see, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and...."
"""He broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples and said:"

Myka did name the ferret.
She's just not telling Pete the name.
- Why not?
- Because she named it Pete.
"Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying."
- That's good.
I like that.
"- You think that's funny, huh?"
"Because if she thinks we know, she'll kill him."
Name's Pete.
"Look, you're in trouble and I'm here to help."
"That chip that you have, the one that's changed your luck..."
- Let go or I'll scream.
"- Jillian, it's hurting you."
"Okay, that is a contact wound."

I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County but would like to stress that these are implications only.

"Yeah, E., and how are you any better?"
"Stop it, puñeta!"
What are you saying to me right now?
"What the fuck, Karina?"
"I told you not to curse in front of the fucking kids,"
You fucking fuck.
They love me.
Ryan:
Castle?
"He's a giant pain in the ass, but he's good people."
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, sure."
We'll help.
"We'll interview Harris' sister, Veronica."
"Yeah, why don't you send us a copy of the murder book, okay?"
Thanks.
"I need a favor, but you can't tell Javi."
[Laughs] I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
It's not bad.
It's just...
I met a guy.
I like him.
And I want you to run a background check on him.
- Romantic.
- Seriously.
"In this day and age, you can't trust anyone."
I don't want to fall for the guy and then discover he's got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
"I'll, uh, check it out."
Check what out?
"Uh, this, uh..."
This rash that I have.
"Yeah, I wanted to get Lanie's medical opinion on it."
"Too much information, bro."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"Later, boys."
Castle:
First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on.
There were 5.
And we've got 2 in camp.
"If you got all the villagers in, what would that do for you?"
That'd give us 300-500.
Better get on the Psy War about this.
NIM:
"When you leave, Dai Uy?"
Tomorrow.
Hopefully.
"Da Nang, Nha Trang, Saigon and home!"
My home is in Hanoi.
I go home too someday.
You see.
"First, kill all stinking Cong."
Then go home.
Will there be anything else?
"That's all, Nim."
NIM:
"Thank you, sir."
He sounds like he means it.
He keeps score on the wall of his hooch.
He personally greased 52 this year.
Says he'll double it if all the 'Yards will get out of his way and give him a clear field of fire.
I noticed a load of corrugated tin's miraculously appeared overnight.
Sergeant Petersen provided it.
A good man you got there.
Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?
He said the good fairy left it.
"I hope he said, ""The good fairy left it, sir!"""
"Captain, will you join us in the commo bunker?"
MacDANIEL:
"Good evening, colonel."
What did I tell you?
"I talked to you before, didn't I?"
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
The fucking car?
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
-l love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.
-l just got married.
-Are you nuts?
-What am I getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I getting excited about?
"Because you're going to get us all fuckin' pinched, that's why."
"What are you, stupid?"
-What's the matter with you?
-l apologize.
-l'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say?
You being a fuckin' wise guy with me?
"You know it's not cursing if you say a letter, mom."
"Oh, sure."
Sure.
"""F."" ""F!""..."
"You know, honey."
We never got a chance to talk about the divorce.
"And we can do that, if you'd like."
"No, I get it."
Stuff happens.
I'm good.
Okay.
Did you know...
That Cleveland was originally spelled... c-l-e-a-v-e-l-a-n-d?
The Cleveland spelling?
You went to that?
I was desperate.
"And how does that make you feel, Melanie?"
What?
"It's an annoying question, isn't it?"
But all the therapists ask it.
I've been trying different ones every day.
It's a little bit like dating... except you're not trying to hide how crazy you are.
Hello.
All.
"Victoria, are you okay?"
You look exhausted.
"Oh, good."
I was just making sure... 'cause the foundation people will be here soon.
"Oh, that's will's phone."
Why is it he can talk to everybody else but not to me?
You mustn't blame yourself.
Now I-I did absolutely everything I could... for both my kids.
We have to.
"We can't knock a skip, Roberto."
We have no choice.
"We can't knock a skip, Roberto."
We have no choice.

-Fill me in here.
What's...
"Okay, so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go down there,"
"- have a 360 around, just doing a chair check... - ...before I get the hard hat on and suited up."
"Checking out to see if there's any foreign objects, debris that might come down on top of me."
"And then, once-once I've checked her out, top of the water level, um then I'll, come back up and get suited up."
-Okay.
Jump on.
-Fantastic.
Okay.
"-Cool, buddy."
Let's give it a go.
-Yeah.
"Okay, up."
Okay.
Lower down.
- Down slow.
"-That's good now, yeah."
Down four.
Slower four.
"What do you got there, Tony?"
Loose one?
"Yeah, I've got a loose rock here, mate."
"I want to take that out, um, before we go any further."
"It's...if that comes down, it's, it's bad news, man."
Got it.
That could make a good day go bad really fast.
"Okay, I'll take that hard hat back."
-Here you go.
"-Thanks, Mike."
"Take me down probably another two feet, Mike."
Roger.
"âª Go home âª âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª âª I tried my luck, now what the fuck To do with the misery?"

Oh.
Um...
What time is it?
I don't know. 10:17?
Are you all right?
Tired.
I didn't sleep.
I have an incredible headache.
You're dehydrated.
- Did I drink last night?
- You don't remember?
"Yeah, you drank."
At... at that bar?
"At the bar, here..."
Here?
Did something hap...
Did I do something?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What...
"Hi, boys!"
"Oh, I gotta run."
I gotta pick up the twins from my mother's and drop them off at daycare because I got the lunch shift today.
"Hope that things work out for you soon,"
- honeybunch.
- Oh.
"Alright, I'll see ya when I see ya."
Bye!
Bye.
Maddy!
"I can't believe you are doing this, Maddy!"
I didn't bring you here so you could catch it.
"Shannon, relax."
This is for our safety.
You said The Beast is killing animals.
It could easily turn on us if it isn't contained.
"So, what?"
Then you're going to let it go?
"I'm not in the business of caging wild animals, no matter how unusual."
"We put it in here to get a closer look, that's all."
That's cool with me.
That thing has some serious fangs.
Shan.
OK.
I'm sorry.
It's just... it just got real all of a sudden.
"That's why I'm here, Shannon."
To show the world The Beast is real.
OK?
OK.
They'll kill us.
What are you going to say to them?
I don't know but I don't think sorry's going to cut it.
We could go back.
Do you want to?
Look.
Put it on me.
Tell them I made you do it.
"Thanks, but I'll take the blame."
I've earned it.
It's starting.
Okay.
I'm just gonna pack this up.
I'll see you there in a minute.
Wood:
"The owner seemed a bit punchy, but his ride was great..."
"A $45,000 2009 Grand Cherokee Hemi."
"I knew a lot about this jeep, and I had a feeling my knowledge was about to get me a big tip."
"Jeep really started, like, the luxury SUV."
"With these in America in '93, I think it was... great cars."
It's kind of strange 'cause the car has a lot of power for...
Geez.
Hello.
"You know, for what it is."
It's a strong car.
It just doesn't...

Ferrara:
"At around 11:00, I got a call from my next pick-up."
I hadn't made any money yet and hoped my next passenger would be more generous than captain climate control.
- Andrew?
- Andrew.
Adam.
Nice to see you.
"Adam, nice to meet you."
All right.
"I'm here to get you home safe, my friend."
[ Laughs ] Good.
Good.
After you.
Thank you very much.
Which way's your car?
My car is right over there.
"Okay, what's going on Marta?"
Know what I think?
I think you set me up.
I think this amnesia is bullshit.
"No, no."
"Oh, fuck me."
What?
"You're gonna tell me, you don't know who this is?"
Who is it?
"It's Jared, damn you."
"Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta."
Why?
I don't know.
"Alright, I don't remember anything, I swear."
Is Jared a victim too or is he in on this?
"Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here."
What're you gonna do?
It's Kyra.
I told you to turn off your cell phone.
What have you gotten us into?
Why are you calling here?
Because I told her to.
You know she was packing to leave when we got here.
"Oh, I haven't spoken to you since Berlin, partner."
"What do you want, Jared?"
"Oh, come on."
You're a smart guy.
"You've spoken to Marta, you found my place."
You must have figured it out by now.
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.
There ya go.
This can't be agency sanctioned.
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine with my scene.
I think she likes it.
"Obviously, she's getting stoned with you..."
-...and she's reading Spin.
-I don't read Spin.
I've never read Spin.
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
"It's always like that with you, isn't it?"
They....
They always just happen to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
"It means you're charmed, that's all."
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Your life looks good from my perspective.
-I've worked for what I have.
-And I haven't?
-You are so stuck on the negative.
-I'm not.
"Yes, you are."
-You've blocked out all the fun we had.
-I haven't blocked it out.
It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah.
- What are you two up to?
"Nothing, God, don't be such a paranoid freak."
"Party time, princess."
It's time for us to say goodbye.
Like hell.
"We made a deal, Karp."
- Liana's coming.
- She's... she's coming here?
It's a family reunion.
And I'm off to one of my own.
"Farewell, my sweet."
Your generosity will not be forgotten.
It was just an accident.
Motorcycles don't have seat belts.
You could have died.
"If you had died, I'd be alone."
"You wouldn't be Flynn, you'd just be dead."
"Emme, I said I'm sorry."
What else do you want me to say?
Huh?
"He's fine, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine."
"How are you holding up, Emme?"
Holding what up?
How are you doing with Flynn being hurt?
I'm fine.
He's not going to die.
Did my counselor leave?
"She'll be here in a few minutes, take you back home."
You mean school.
This is my home.
"Yeah, of course it is."
I'm gonna go look for Haydn.
Been trying to get those two together for a year.
"I did it, and now I'm like a dog off his leash."
"Okay, Dad."
"And let me tell you, I didn't waste any time."
I'm on the Tinder.
"Oh, okay, well, it sounds like you're good."
I'm banging my balls off!
"Medium rare, medium rare."
I want that burger medium rare.
Are you at the OTB?
"Yes, I am."
And you'll never believe what horse is running today...
Daddy's revenge.
How perfect is that?
"I got big money on this one, kid."
They're off!
"Go, go, you son of a bitch, run!"
"Spike him, spike him, you miserable little munchkin."
Hit him!
Hit him like you're wearing big boy pants!
That's it!
"Oh, faster, faster!"
"Santa needs you back at the village, yes!"
"Go, you son of a bitch, go!"
Yes!
Winner!
Revenge!
"Oh, ah, shit."
Dad?
"Oh, shit."
"Hey, Frank, it's me, Smolinski."
"Yeah, I don't know how comas work, but if you can hear me, screw you and wake up, you big shit."
Let's get the doors and windows locked.
"We're staying here, where it's safe."
"He's out of control, and we're not having you going down with him."
I'm not going to let you abandon him!
Who are you?
I'm Bryn.
Your brother.
And I've come to take you home.
"Morning, Len."
It's funny it used to be the sound of the cycling that woke me and now... it's very much the smell.
"The sound you get used to it, not to the smell."
I like it.
"Len, when you work up a sweat it's like a slow-frying sausage."
Whitsun!
What?
Whitsun!
What are you talking about?
What are you doing for Whitsun?
Have you decided?
"Mum, I don't even know what or when Whitsun is."
Are you alright?
You look a bit peaky.
"Yeah, I feel a bit odd."
I might pop to the doctor.
"Oh, Jenny, love."
Have a thing about Whitsun!
Jenny?
What pants have you got on?
"Mum, go inside."
Would you want these *** ones?
You want a decent pair on for the doctor.
Mama ain't seen you that low in years.
I haven't seen a road like this in years.
"- Well, then let's cruise, baby."
- Low and slow.
E bellissima!
It's beautiful!
"Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels."
"Boy, I tell you what."
I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.
"Doc, look at this!"
"Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?"
"Well, he ain't finished yet."
Still got a long way to go.
"Guido, look at Luigi!"
This is fantastico!
That looks like fun!
"Mater, I got dibs, next turn!"
"Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump."
That crazy old devil woman.
Oh!
She's right!
- Ah!
- Guido!
Huh.
That punk actually did a good job.
"Well, now... where the heck is he?"
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?
"No, no."
"He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, and asked me if he could come down here."
All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.
"No, no, no, no!"
"""That's my brother's boy."
"""I guess I heard of my own kin."""
"So I said, ""You spoke to him?"""
"He says, ""Spoke to who?"" I said, ""Ray Malcolm."""
"He said, ""Ray Malcolm?"
"""That's my brother's boy."""
Can you imagine the conversation when Ray shows up?
Want some rolls?
"Yes, ma'am."
Is this great or what?
DUD:
"This looks great, Cheryl Ann."
There you go.
I hope to hell he does show his heinie up there 'cause I got news for you.
That white trash and them two niggers...
Ow!
"That stung, Cheryl Ann."
You nearly broke my Le...
"Bonnie, pass me them pickles, will you?"
JOHN:
I never got any beans.
"Can I get some now, please?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Did you think I was going to cut you, honey?"
I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world.
You know that.
Here.
I'm glad you didn't kill that man in the car lot.
What do you think we are?
"No, fuck all that, Dale."
It don't mean nothing.
What I'm concerned about is that we left ourselves so goddamn exposed...
I left my pancakes at the buffet.
"Well, have some of mine."
"Oh, thank..."
Mmm.
Thank you.
"Can I have a bite, Daddy?"
"Do you want some more, Princess?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- No, thank you."
Oh.
I think he was talking to me.
"Actually, he's called me Princess since I was a baby."
My dad called me Frizz.
"- Hey, Mom."
"- Hi, sweetie."
"Uh, can I go show my art project to Papa Jeff?"
"Ritchie, don't call him that."
It makes your mom feel preposterous.
"No, it doesn't."
I'm completely fine.
"Yes, Ritchie, go show your project to Pa..."
Papa Jeff.
"Okay, Ritchie, but we better stop by the nurse's office and have your hearing checked."
I think you got something in your ear... oh!
Awesome!
Did you...?
What is it about grandpas that they can always find change in kids' ears?
"I know you're really enjoying yourself, Richard, but I just want you to know, it doesn't bother me at all."
- It doesn't?
- No.
Not even a little bit?
I said it doesn't bother me.
But I wanted to check in first.
"- Well, I'm doing great."
Thanks for asking.
- Check in on Stefan.
"Oh, him?"
"Oh, he's..."
He's terrible.
What's the matter?
"He's just back to boring, strait-laced, off the junk."
You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
- Don't forget who helped me.
- I hate myself.
"Hey, did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the teacher?"
"No, I've still been avoiding him."
Why?
What's he up to?
- I'd love it if you could find out for me.
- I gotta go.
I'm late.
Have fun with the Mystic queen.
I know I did.

"Top 12 go every year, and today is qualifying race."
Race number 3 at the starting line.
Right now ....
Yeah Jacob.
Jacob wooo.
The 45 are about to enter the first turn here at cow-boy Badlands MX park.
Again the top 12 qualify for the Texas amateur all-star.
Jacob Wilson now starts to put up a little bit of pressure running up front.
Jacob.
Gary Owens also appears....
"Couple of laps in, here we go with Gary Owens, Jacob Wilson and Jason...."
Come on.
All three of them.
And Jacob Wilson now takes over the lead....
"Good, good."
While Gary Owens is on his track.
"Owen makes the pass, puts Jacob Wilson over the berm."

No.

"Hey, you were great."
Okay.
Anything else I can get you boys?
Siri is a little ...
-are You fine?
What the fuck you think you are?
Thought he could be quiet and I never find out?
I could not say that Christer was helping us.
There was nothing between Christer and I since high school.
He worked for you!
It was with you that he talked that night!
I can cry if I want to!
Okay.
"Sit down, Siri."
-With Whom you spoke?
'They did not believe me.
"They think I knew, and now they want a lot of money."
-With Whom you spoke?
-I Did not say anything.
A journalist found out.
It was with you that he slept when we were discussing?
"Yes, a few nights on the couch."
I've never been with him.
"You met secretly at night, was not it?"
Why do not you stop him?
It was dangerous!
It was you who did join ...
What the fuck.
You're not my sister.
"He wanted, right?"
He wanted revenge for what happened in Sweden.
He was killed because he worked for you.
You killed him!
"And now they're killing me, too."

Always knew someday you'd come walking back through my door.
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.

It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do.
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it.
But maybe we can help each other now.

You know the one I mean?
Yeah.

... andstillgotadate with oneof the most beautiful women I've ever met.
"-l'm not only happy for you, I'm proud."
-Thank you.
"Now, I have to re-evaluate everything I thought I knew..."
"... aboutmen,women,relationships, God and the universe."
But that's not your problem.
"Charlie, I am as surprised as you that she said yes."
I don't think so.
"I was really intimidated, but as it turns out, she's just like a regular person..."
"... exceptfor,youknow, being from the planet:"
"Alan, never do that around me again."
"- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor."
What time is it?
"How are they biting, Reynolds?"
"- You, you're drunk, Reznik."
- The game's over.
I got proof on you.
I'm gonna use it.
"You better watch your fucking ass, buddy, before you lose it."
Trevor?
"I need to see you, Stevie."
"- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here."
"- Please, Stevie."
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?
"No, no, no."
"No, no, I need to see you now."
"In case of something happens, I need someone to know."
"Okay, give me a minute."
"I appreciate you making time for me, you are the only one I can talk to."
My pleasure.
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.
"Something is happening to me, Stevie."
Some kind of... plot.
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.
"- Oh, my god!"
- Now the guys at work are against me.
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...
"Their eyes, their little games."
What?
E R..
But he is a responsible police officer.
I can't interfere in this matter.
And what do you think?
Will he let you go scot-free if I tell him?
"That I am his friend, doesn't mean that I have bought him out."
"Ifyou haven't done it yet, do it now. I am with you."
Meaning?
"Here's 1 ,OOO,OOO in this bag."
Tell me ifyou think the price is less.
There is no price for Vijay.
My friend is priceless.
You can't buy his honesty.
Not even for 10 million.
My friend is a man of principles.
Amazing!
He is the first lawyer I have seen in my life whose hobby is to fly an airplane.
Flying isn'tjust an hobby for Ravi.
It is his life's first romance.
His first love.
Tell me something.
- Go ahead.
"Even you must have had a first love, hadn't you?"
Yes. I did have a girlfriend.
But why do you ask?
Just nothing.
Was she in your college?
-Oh yes.
In college...in my class.
What was her name?
The name was...
Meenakshi.
Meenakshi Chatterjee.
OLDER TED:
"There was no ""next time."""
Maggie's window never opened again.
Hey!
"Hey, I got it!"
"That country bar, Giddy-ups!"
The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-ups.
I want that.
"I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing, but I think I'm ready again."
Yeah.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I wanna have sex with a girl so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
Come on!
"Ted, you gotta help me!"
I gotta get these damn things off!
MRS. DOUGLAS:
Hey there.
I just love your overalls.
MARSHALL:
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.
By now you should be working somewhere that's making the world a better place.
Or at least trying to.
"No pressure, dude."
"I mean, sir."
"Also, if time travel is possible, maybe you could give me a little sign on Tuesday, December 8th, at 8:29 p.m."
"So, someone sent back these chicken wings, because they were too hot."
"And I'm like, ""Too hot?"
"Are you crazy?"""
"So, free wings."
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-Yes.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Allison MacKenzie.
"Miss MacKenzie, how long have you known Selena Cross?"
Ever since I was a child.
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.
"Ms. MacKenzie, you've testified that when you saw Lucas beating Selena... you thought that your presence prevented things from going further."
-I know it did.
"-You don't know, you assume."
"Well, he was embarrassed to find me watching."
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?
-Once.
-Once?
"Now, did he hit her with his fist or a weapon?"
"-Well, it was kind of a slap."
-A slap?
"Have you ever been slapped, Miss Mackenzie?"
-Yes.
-By a stranger?
-No.
-By a member of the family?
-Do I have to answer this?
"-I'm sorry, but you do."
By my mother.
As hard a blow as Selena Cross' stepfather gave her?
-No.
-How could you tell?
I don't think so.
"You don't really know what happened inside that house, do you?"
We'll crawl in.
It's probably time I was gettin' home.
"No, but it's still early."
"All right, then."
It's only a block away.
"Well, it feels like you're runnin' away."
No.
Just walkin'.
"'Night, John Sellers."
"Goodnight, Zelda Sayre."
♫♫
"It's the damnedest thing, Townsend."
"Zelda writes how much she misses me, and then she says that she's going off to Cotillion with Peyton, Patton, Perry..."
A girl has to keep her options open.
[scoffs]
What do you write back?
"Frankly, I think it's extremely inconsiderate of her to even expect me to."
"I mean, she's the one that's insisting that"
I rewrite my novel before she'll marry me.
Which you've done.
And I'm doing again.
"Once I get off to a good start, that is."
Hm.
I just need to show her that I can do it.
[clears throat]
"Hell, she knows I can."
I know I can.
But until then... why not send her a note?
"She's quite aware of how I feel, Townsend."
- In my experience...
- [chuckles]
Women like to be reminded.
Your friend has a powerful enemy.
It's open season on her and I wanted to be the one to do it.
"VICKI, IT'S ME!"
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.
WATCH OUT!
You're too late to save your friend.
I'm over here!
Nope!
Here!
- What are you?
- What I am.
- You know.
- Demon.
"There are all kinds of us, with all kinds of hungers."
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Nothing is without purpose.
"You want me, right?"
Why'd you kill the kids?
"I hook them on the bottle, then move them up to the spike."
That's when I feed all their sweet juices.
I had to sacrifice a few to get your attention.
"If your kind get too much of the bug in them, my little ones go crazy and they feed, too."
"That's kind of a win-win, right?"
That tickled.
Darkness is waiting.
Let it wait.
"It'll take a lot more than that to beat me, bitch!"
Henry?
Sorry I'm late.
Sweet ride.
You don't have to be pushed by no foreigners.
There are a lot of guys in this town.
Americans who feel like you and me.
They've been giving this a lot of thought.
They can show you how to protect yourself.
Would you like to meet them?
Sure.
"But, Mr. Osgood, the stay-on lasts so much longer."
Heh-heh.
"Yeah, so I've heard."
- Anything else?
- No.
That'll be 50 cents.
Fifty cents?
For Ajax Shaving Cream?
I can buy it for 37 down the street at Molyneux's Cut Rate.
"Well, you better trade there then."
We don't cut nobody's prices or throats.
Molyneux's Cut Rate store.
"If you haven't got the stay-on kind, Mr. Osgood, I'll take this."
Milady Beautiful.
"Anything else, Mrs. Danvers?"
"Oh, a package of henna."
The good kind.
"How do you do, Mr. Taylor?"
- Hello.
"- Seen our friend, Eddie, these days?"
Yeah.
"You ain't gonna let him marry, are you?"
And why not?
"It's still a free country, ain't it?"
- That will be a dollar 39.
"Okay, this eye--"
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz?
!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
Is Liz back yet?
"No, which cat do you want Jenna to carry?"
I'm sorry?
Which cat?
Oh.
I want...that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just--I just rescued him from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghey to his face that I quit.
"And I want to do it in front of the whole crew, so that they know he didn't fire me."
I wanna see that.
Gonna turn the lights down low.
It's almost time for the Girlie Show
"Ooh, ooh, pull over."
Pull over here.
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
This is where I grew up.
I have something you might wanna know before you go.
- I hope it doesn't have to do with Blair.
- It has to do with you.
"About Santorini, what you were looking for."
While I was on the trip you so graciously gave me I found it again.
"Only it's not in Santorini anymore, it's in Fiji."
At least he was last week.
You found my father?
Get in.
Let's go.
Why aren't you in Europe?
I was in Paris but only to get your favorite macaroons from Pierre Hermé.
And Germany?
To pick up your favorite Falke stockings.
You know how I adore them.
"- What are you doing here, then?"
- You were right.
"I was a coward, running away again."
But everywhere I went you caught up with me.
So I had to come back.
I wanna believe you.
But I can't.
- You've hurt me too many times.
- You can believe me this time.
That's it?
I love you too.
But can you say it twice?
[LAUGHING]
"No, I'm serious, say it twice."
CHUCK:
I love you.
I love you.
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
"Can you come back, or no?"
"- No, no, I'm going to go."
"- Okay, well, did you know why"
I came to see you today?
"Well, I'm making a film about Lou."
"- Well, I knew that."
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But...
I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
"Gosh, you love a man..."
"and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son."
I don't know.
"Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter."
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
"That was his, that was his very personal thing."
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
I think I'm in love already.
Gah!
That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.
Excuse me.
Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
I am.
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid there is.
I need to talk to you about my father.
Arthur Waverly.
You might have noticed we're playing a round of golf here.
"You have a question, call my office."
I'm sure...
That's not how this is gonna work.
We're gonna talk about my father.
We're gonna do it right now.
"Hey, buddy."
This isn't the time.
Maybe you should tell your friends to take a walk.
"It's okay, guys."
Just give us a minute.
I'll see you at the clubhouse.
"Look, I don't know what you think that I could tell you, but..."
How sick is my father?
He has stage four.
It doesn't look good.
That's one.
One what?
I understand that you sent him to Argentina.
I'd like to know why.
I can't discuss private medical records.
That's two.
Never heard that.
"Look at me, I'm not the greatest looking fellow, so...."
"I'm not beautiful at all, really."
"I seen them the other night, they're not the best."
I think they're crap.
Why do you Iike One Direction?
They're perfect.
They're perfect?
"Far from it, love."
I tell you what they're not great at all.
I don't know why you even like One Direction!
They're crap!
AII go home!
I quit this job it's crap!
I'm going back to glasgow.
That is absolutely nuts.
Mak es me a bit uncomfortable.
I'm actually scared of you.
You look like a fat russell Brand.
I want to look like you when I'm older because I think you look quite interesting.
"One, two, three, four."
O2 Arena!
"London, I wanna kiss every single one of you!"
Go crazy.
"One, two three, four!"
Are there any bears in Sweden?
We need one of them big long machetes.
Where are we putting the tent?
-Set up tent here.
-Over here?
-Yeah.
-And make the fire here.
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
Is that a big thing out here?
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
Folks take it real seriously -- train for months.
"Eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff, you know, like, uh..."
"Baked beans, buff wings, butter."
Butter?
Yeah.
Sometimes deep-fried.
Hm.
"This year alone, Wayne won the Butter Bowl, the Wing Ding, and Shrimptasia."
"Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut was the only one Slim Jim couldn't beat in the whole Great Lakes region."
So is he a suspect?
"We checked him out, but Slim Jim was in the Hot Doggery at the time of Wayne's death, and we got 15 witnesses to prove it."
Really?
Yeah.
Training.
"When I gear up for a competition, I eat lettuce -- stretches the stomach."
Yet another reason to stay away from salads.
How well did you know Wayne McNut?
"Well, well enough to know he was a weasel and a cheat."
"I hate to say it, but, uh, karma's a bitch."
This is interesting.
Mala's good-luck charms.
And Mala is...?
My old lady.
Is your old lady superstitious?
Yeah.
She's Romanichal.
Romanichal?
Gypsy.
But don't call her that.
"TO THE ""PITTSBURGH COURIER,"""

IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF ROBINSON'S GREAT MISSTEPS.

ONE BLACK PERSON CRITICIZE ANOTHER

"You got a ""D"" on your math test?"
You don't get D's.
"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
"I'll tell you what you're gonna do, Brick."
You're gonna study.
Math is very important in life.
You use math in everything...
"Oh, even I can't say it like I believe it."
Hey.
Hey.
"Look at this... a ""D."""
"- Axl, get in here!"
- This is Brick.
Really?
"What happened, buddy?"
You don't get D's.
We're kinda counting' on you to pull up the family average.
I'm reading at an eighth grade level.
Why can't I please you people?
!
Just reading isn't gonna get you into college.
"Oh, I'm not going to college."
I've decided to live with you guys forever.
Forever.
"Well, mike, you know what this means, don't ya?"
"Oh, jeez."
We're gonna have to help Brick with his homework.
"In our house, helping with homework"
Is something that's never gone well.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Why aren't you writing it down?
- I'm gonna eat in the car and then...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Give it, give it!"
Do you know what I was doing right before I almost died?
Exactly what you're doing.
Humoring a relative?
"No, no, scheduling my life down to the last minute."
"I mean, look at this..."
"""Call New York office... 4:17 P.M."""
Do you realize that everybody but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes?
"Today made me realize something, Mitchell."
"No, I don't want to be a 4:17 kind of person."
- Do you?
"- Yes, I do."
'Cause that phone call needs to be done by 4:23 so that I am not a dead man by 4:41.
Give me my phone.
- Nope.
Nope.
No.
- Give me...
Claire.
We're gonna do something together.
"Yes, take the rest of the day off."
- I can't do that.
"- Yes, you can."
I did!
"Yeah, 'cause you work for your father."
"- No, no, no, we need this, Mitchell."
"- Hey, come on, give me my..."
- We really need this.
"- Claire, I'm really swamped today, and I..."
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...
"No, probably not."
Don't worry.
Good-bye.
Isn't that ditch finished yet?
I've hit a rock.
Good luck.
"I can see, in fact. I can hear."
We've reached a dead-end too.
"You're lucky, you have a pickaxe."
We don't have one.
We can't do anything.
I can provide you with a pickaxe.
Our problem can't be solved by a pickaxe.
"If it could, things would be easier."
One blow of a pickaxe would do.
"Instead of a pickaxe, you can offer me some tea."
"Please, help yourself."
"If you give me your Juliet's address, I'll ask her to provide us with milk."
"In the village, knock on any door and they'll give you milk."
I didn't find any.
"Even at the sea, there's no water for me!"
Can't I ask her for some?
No problem.
She's at Kakrahman's.
Go to the village...
You'll find her there.
Kakrahman's house...
"Ask anyone, they'll know where it is."
Get in.
I'm not disturbing you?
- Yes.
Thank God.
I'm meeting Frank Anselmo for breakfast.
"- Oh, good."
Where?
- Woerner's.
Woerner's?
- The hangout at Borough Hall?
- That's it.
"When you go to Brooklyn, you're Frank Anselmo's guest."
Don't piss up his leg.
Just get him off this infrastructure thing.
Nothing wrong with it just unaffordable right now.
Good work tonight.
Mrs. Marquand couldn't stop talking about the cover of Time.
I think she collects them.
"National ink, the mother's milk of politics."
"Did I hear right, or did we get the convention?"
It's not signed and sealed but it is delivered.
And you were the closer.
I thought I had him with the second city stuff.
Of course you did.
You know why?
It belongs here.
New York City.
This is the place.
Excuse me.
"All right, the story's on the 10:00 news."
A little slow.
A bullet took the life of an innocent 6-year-old  on his way to school during a police action.
They're all over it like a cheap suit.
It's going to stick to us like one too.
Call 911!
911!
Mary was so right about you Ben!
What's going on?
"Ben's been telling me the funniest story, about the bus, and the girl, and the.."
Call 911!
You've heard this one before!
"I'm telling you, Ben's heart stopping temporarily was the best thing that ever happened to me."
"He's getting some much-needed bed rest, and I'm emceeing the fundraiser tomorrow night."
How did you manage that?
I promised Dr. Albright I'd stick to Ben's script.
Are you gonna?
- No.
"All right, next up on open- mike night, very funny man, put your hands together for Dick Solomon."
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot!
Thank you so much!
"Now,"
I'm gonna tell you some jokes.
Joke one:
I went fishing last week.
My permit said I could only catch five.
"Oh, I caught five, all right, as in 35."
Was that funny?
"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
But you know..
"pot-stickers, what are they all about?"
Haa-haa!
"Okay, joke number two:"
Some termites..
"I mean, huge termites.."
What are you two zibs doing?
"You should be more careful with this, sir."
What the hell?
"Are you trying to lift my card, asshole?"
"Hey, he's not an asshole."
You're the asshole.
"My God, an American eagle."
"Go, go, go!"
He's coming!
- I know!
I know!
"- Go, go, go!"
"- I'm going, I'm going!"
"- Go, go!"
- Okay!
"- Turn, turn, turn!"
- I'm turning!
- God!
That did not go well!
I know!
I was there!
"His big hobby, his passion is darts."
- Yeah.
"- No, he's in a darts league that competes every Friday at a pub called St. James's Well."
Am I the only one who thinks there's something off about this job?
The only thing off is Maddie's focus.
"Give me a break, Max."
"Maddie, I want to make something very clear."
This job happens to be of special interest to the Doctor.
Max is just freaking out 'cause I had coffee and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.
"No, it's the way that you were talking to him that concerns me."
"You know what, Sal?"
"Ten, nine , eight, seven , six , five , four three , two"
One!
What happened over there?
Well...
"I was just thinking that, since how you're 18 and all, you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies."
"Kid's meal, ferris wheels..."
God knows what else.
I know.
"But hey, this should turn that around."
I've invited the Boss to our party.
"""Dear Daisy,"
I'm sorry I couldn't be at your birthday party but I hope you have a wonderful day.
"Chet . """
it was swell of you to invite him.
Hello?
"Oh, hey Russ."
Is that Russ calling us to wish us a happy vacation?
"Because if it's not, he has got the wrong number."
Oh ...
Ur...
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet .
Vi ?
No fucking way!
Violet says no.
"Violet says "" Fuck NO !"""
I thought you said we had some down time ahead.
"No, Violet told me you would pull something like this."
"Oh, yea , no kidding."
She said you'll do that too.
Up the money and call it an easy gig!
"That's textbook, Russ!"
That's it.
Give me that.
You can have it.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, we should probably go to the bedroom and..."
start clearing stuff out of there.
Right.
Yes.
This is weird.
And this is really weird.
Who's this?
- I don't know.
- How could there be a photo of my dad with his arm around this woman... on his nightstand and I don't even know who she is.
Maybe she's an old friend.
"Nah, she's gotta be a new friend."
This was taken at the Wynn.
The Wynn didn't open until just before he died.
Then maybe she's a new friend.
Why wouldn't he tell me about her?
I know.
It's because I didn't call him often enough.
I wasn't gonna say that.
All right.
Let's hit the closet.
Yeah.
We did it.
What did we do?
It took a lot of people.
"It took a lot of man-hours, but we checked everyone that came into the casino between noon and 3:00."
You want to guess how many people that is?
No.
"Derek, go to your room."
"Man, you""re fantastic."
"Mama, I""m getting married."
"Doesn""t Cassie look beautiful?"
Mom?
"Sweetheart, we could not be happier."
"Isn""t that right, Bobbi?"
"I told you she wouldn""t like it."
"I figured since it was your first wedding dress, it""d be perfect."
That dress is jinxed.
- Figures.
"- Cassie, wait."
"She""s gonna ruin this."
"She""s just dying to ruin this!"
"Mom""s got three kids and we all got different dads."
What did you expect?
- Tim would never cheat.
"- Cassie, your own dad""s a cheater."
"I know you love him, and Rick""s a great guy and all that... but he still cheated on Mom."
"Just like every other jerk she""s been with."
"Don""t worry, you can still call it off."
"You know Mom""s right."
You know in your heart it will never last.
There are still some people in this world that believe in marriage.
Whatever.
But I love him.
Does anybody in this family even care that I love him?
- You want a double-chocolate muffin?
- And how much is that?
May I have one to go?
I thought he was happy.
"L""m happy."
DAN:
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just kidding.
It was just her engagement ring.
So why all the long faces?
-We miss Bull.
HARRY:
Yeah.
Nobody to carry the heavy files.
Or walk us to our car at night.
Hey. wait a minute.
Listen to the way we're talking.
All we care about is how this affects us.
We're supposed to be his friends.
Let's back him up.
"I mean, maybe he's made the right decision."
That's a lot of buffalo chips.
"No, Selma, I think Harry's right."
We've gotta support Bull.
We can't let him know how we feel.
I will not participate in this charade.
The man is making a fool of himself.
Somebody should tell him.
"All you have to do is have the guts to stand up to him and say, ""Bu||...."""
I'm behind you all the way.
"you big Greco-Roman nut, you."
Heh-heh.
Thanks.
I knew you'd come crawling back here where you belong.
-I just came back to clean out my locker.
-You should clean out your head.
-You know--
"- Well, I didn't get that much."
It all kind of went sideways after lunch.
Why?
What happened?
Francine knows about Lorna and Jim.
- How'd she find that out?
- She knew.
"She asked me about it, I lied, said it was a one night thing, but she knows."
I'm gonna have to let Jim know.
Shit!
Please don't put me in this.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
This is gonna get ugly.
What did she say?
"Is she gonna freak on him, or what?"
She just seems really depressed.
I'll handle it.
"I'll look at these later, OK?"
Do me a favour.
Will you go downstairs and make me a cold glass of lemonade?
And ask Ronnie if he can make me a sandwich from the kitchen.
- I'm gonna make Mom a sandwich.
- All right.
Is she upstairs?
Are you feeling all right?
"Sure, everything's fine."
What's wrong with you?
Maybe you want to tell me something.
What are you doing with that?
"Don't do that, Frankie."
"Jesus, don't do that."
Are you fucking Lorna?
Like every day of my life.
So why haven't you?
I don't know.
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's-- I'm scared.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You?
You're like the most confident person I've ever met.
It's very scary.
where would I go?
What would I do?
Anything you wanted to.
close your eyes.
Trust me.
They're closed. do anything.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
I'm right where l want to be.
You know what's funny?
When I was a kid I used to have the map of the world above my bed.
l would just point at various places-- close my eyes and just point.
And I promised myself that I would go visit those places.
And now I'm older and I'm still here in this small little town and I've never visited those places.
the funny thing is you actually got out. you followed a dream.
I really admire that.
You make it sound romantic.
It is.
Isn't it?
My dad-- he's a real son of a bitch.
Come here.
Hey.
Don't worry about this.
Okay?
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
When?
"Nate, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight
Some of these people will never talk to me again.
And--and what happens next year?
What... she does this to the next
Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair?
Well.
What else can you do?
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer
And not face the damage she's done.
No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
Well here's something new--
I told chuck I loved him... again
And he didn't say it back... again.
Blair.
I'm not gonna tell people that.
Why not?
I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
I don't want to be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school
And look what it almost made me do.
That's the thing....
You need to be cold to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart
"When I woke up, I was on the floor."
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?
I passed out.
Just a game.
Jesus.
"Jesus, Jesus!"
Jesus God!
God!
"I don't know, and I don't understand why I can't remember."
"Doesn't matter, just do as I say."
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.
You decided to spend the night at Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.
"We'd done it before, and I know that I could not have hurt that girl."
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.
It'll be as though she never existed.
All that's left is our friendship.
-Yes?
"-Sorry, but we're not to let you through."
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr.
Hagen's.
He's coming.
I'll speak to him.
"I wanted to explain, but I had business in Carson City."
It's Michael's request for your safety.
Why?
I guess there were some complaints that your eyes were more interesting to watch than the lead performance.
Ohh.
"I'm really sorry, honey."
"Oh, it stinks."
"(Sighs) Oh, my God."
I can't believe we're not in the play.
"Uh, yeah, well..."
That's not exactly true.
So we are doing the play?
"No, we're not."
So we're off the play.
"No, no."
That's not it.
So we're on the play.
- We're not.
- We're not?
Right.
We're not.
What?
Your mom's in.
You're out.
Just say it.
"Thank you, Mike."
I was getting there!
What?
"But you're gonna quit, right?"
"Well, quitting is certainly something that I could do, although I am the strongest voice of all the Ozians... (Sighs) And it is for charity, but if you really want me to quit, then I--"
I want you to quit.
"Okay, well, let's not jump into any rash decisions."
"Just sleep on it, and if you still want me to quit in the morning, I will."
I want you to quit.
All right.
"Hey, I was right."
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
"Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?"
"Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy."
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
"You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming."
"Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn."
"I mean, no one warned me."
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
"Yeah, but where do I get my technique?"
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
"I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates."
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
We'll get Toxie coming out of--
Who's Toxie?
He's not doing stunts or anything.
"No, no."
"We just-- we got to have some stuff with Toxie, man."
We can't wait around.
"It's been like five hours since his call time,"
"And he's still not here yet, you know."
--[inaudible] close-up when they were coming out
"Oh, is he here now?"
I see the van.
"That's our van, right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"I don't see him, though."
Let him see.
"We got our Toxie, right?"
Instill the fear of God into Toxie.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
I think it's time to-
- I'm
Not too happy with this.
I'm happy to use this guy.
It's 10 o'clock.
This is ridiculous.
"We shot with the stand-in, who was inconspicuously"
"Tito's height, when Dave, our really Toxie,"
Is at least a foot taller.
"And he normally carries both of us, which is the humor in it."
He carries Tito and Sweetie Honey.
"It's kind of funny, 'Cause Dave's a strong guy,"
And he can do that.
"Ah, there you are, sir."
I like her.
"I like her, too."
She likes me.
I guess you didn't have your eyes peeled.
It was me she was flipping her frills and furbelows at.
"Just a minute, jim- here, here... if the lady comes up, i go backstage."
"If the eagle shines, the pass-through's all yours."
All right.
Uh- let me flip it.
Where did it go?
"I don't know, but you better hurry and find it."
The show's over.
She'll be going out with someone else.
"Nick, you go back to her dressing room and ask her if she'll go to a lobster party."
"Soon as i find this lucky piece, i'll join you."
Luke?
Yeah.
You go over to the astor house and reserve the best table in the place.
Yeah.
And send somebody here with a lantern.
Idiot!
Imbecile!
"You want to be an actress, eh?"
"Well, here is good luck!"
I've had just about enough of this!
Someone is at the door!
See who it is!
Yes?
"Oh, good evening, mademoiselle."
I see my flowers have arrived.
"Oh, you are mr."
Fisk.
Come on.
We do all right.
Love In The Afternoon.
Eh?
"Well, it'll be a big photograph of the choir and the Halle."
"And will we be allowed to, like, buy one?"
We will.
"Did they say how much that photo's going to be, Mr Kirkby?"
"It's got to be four or five bob, hasn't it?"
A big cardboard job.
"Well, I wanted to get one for Mam."
She'll have your school photo.
"No, she didn't get it."
"See you Saturday, Mr Kirkby."
Oi!
Eccles cake.
The labourer is worthy of his hire.
"Thanks, sir."
Bye!
And...
How come?
Mr Kirkby give it me.
"For carrying all his hymn books, because you know he's religious, so he has to carry hymn books, but he can't because of his leg."
Carry them.
"If I only had one leg, I'd put a wheel where my leg was."
"Would you, Mam?"
Put a wheel where your leg was?
I'd put a motorbike.
Get me to work quicker.
# My Christian name is Enid
# My mother is to blame
# She wanted something nondescript
[Handcuffs].
What the hell happened?
-It wasn't Jacob's fault.
"He was trying to protect everybody, and lance was just ...."
"I got the boy off to the town hospital, he's gonna be fine."
You have any I'd where these boys might have gone?
I don't know.
The detectives out there want you both to come at the station.
Are you kidding me Walter?
"My kids are out there, scared and alone, I'm not going to any of your dam station."
"When they find them, they're bringing them in."
What's he doing?
-He's just staring at me.
Let's go.
[Hangs up the gas pipe]
"Hyder, hey, stop."
Stop.
"Hey, Hyder."
"Stop, where are Wes and Jacob?"
Uh?
Where are they?
The beach.
[Cicadas].
"Hey, how long?"
Has to be about at least 30mn before it gets back over here.
"Okay, we'll be back."
Let's go.
You remember when mom used to take us here to wait?
We start over in Galveston.
Just like she wanted.
It will be like ....
The Swiss family Wilson or something.
(LAUGHS)
"I'm sorry, but what does that have to do with Trina?"
Exactly?
"I dunno, George."
"You're the writer, mate."
Just telling you the story.
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
(PARTY MUSIC)
Excuse me.
"Ah, no worries, Mr T."
Hey Dad!
Welcome to 'Lindsay dealing with her grief through partying'.
"Not your idea, I hope."
"Well, she said she was having a few friends over after her exams, but then this happened."
Right.
I might just go see how she's doing.
Tragic.
"You've got to shut this down and kick her out, Dad."
Probably not the best idea right now.
"Yes, she's lost her Mum, but clearly it's not causing her much distress right now."
"Eugh, of all the awkward times."
Do something.
Please?
"OK, I'll have a chat to her."
Hi George!
Hope you don't mind this little post exam blow-out.
It's so cool to see all my friends.
"It might have been a good idea to ask me first, Lyndsay."
"Yeah, I know."
But once word got out
I think people just wanted to show me some love.
What's going on?
Jenna?
Sweetheart.
"Oh, honey."
"Sweetheart, what's the matter?"
"All right, come on."
"Come on, just come in."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You'll be fine, sweetheart."
- Jenna?
"- Hey, it's me."
- Hello.
- Is she there?
Anna?
I'm coming over.
Please don't tell her.
"I know I'm being such a pain in the ass right now, but I had to come and see you."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I know you're like, ""This girl's a freak, get her away from me,"""
but I have something for you.
Don't you want to know what it is?
"I made you, like, the best mix CD ever."
"I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it."
Like some really cool Madison bands that I'm sure you've never heard of before.
"And, like, the first song that we danced to."
"And there's also, like, this song of me playing the flute which you're gonna think is totally God-awful."
But I thought it'd...
- Kim.
- What?
There's something I have to tell you.
There's something I have to tell you.
"Huh, I'll write it again."
My hand... my hand shakes sometimes.
You write it so it looks nice.
"I'm very sorry, I have to go before the soldiers come."
The last one...
the last one was about...
My memory isn't very good.
"No, I remember."
I went walking in the morning.
It was...it was very cold.
Tell her I wore my sweater.
She worries about that sort of...thing.
"And...and, uh... and I, uh, and I what?"
And I saw they had torn down that old building where you and the other children used to...to play.
"And, uh...what...?"
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.
I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.
And...there was more.
There was something about a friend...
I...
Why can't I remember?
I wanted to tell her!
Is all right.
She'll understand.
"Yes, yes, you're right."
She will.
Please let me come with you.
"I'm sorry;, thas not possible."
Check this one here!
Is there another way out?
Open up or else!
There.
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
- What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
- Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
- Are you?
- I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D. the fingerprints yet?"
- There's a backlog.
- Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D. her.
[chuckles] make it snow!
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] all right.
- this is one badass christmas!
"- tim, watch your language!"
- * we wish you a merry christmas * * we wish you a merry christmas * * we wish you a merry christmas * * and a happy new year * good tidings to you
- mega hug.
- * to you and your kin * good tidings for christmas * and a happy new year
- well...
i think that pretty well.
- she's a changed person!
"- aw, she'll blow it."
but today she's having a good one.
[coughing]
- * we won't go until we get some *
- only one for you.
- [chuckles] okay.
- ahh!
- hey.
- merry christmas.
- cheers. [chuckles]
- salud.
- merry christmas.
- [clicks tongue]
- i love christmas.
- i love this.

ONE OF THE GUYS I ASKED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT
ON THIS BURN-NOTICE BUSINESS
TOLD ME YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK YOUR TRIP TO D.C.
WHY?
WHAT DID HE SAY?
THE GUY WHO BURNED YOU --
IT TURNS OUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO UP THERE TO SEE HIM
BECAUSE...
"WELL,HE'S COMING DOWN HERE TO SEE YOU."
SEE ME?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST A HEADS-UP.
"WELL,IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET"
?
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until-
- We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing- no cash, no credit, no job history."
- You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you  a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-
- Should we shoot them?
an old friend who's informing on you to the F.B.I.
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.
- Family too-
"- Hey, is that your mom again?"
- Two in the center?
- No.
Rules are different for cops.
- I'm losin' my shirt here with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.
"- Hey, Freddy."
- You a cop too?
"Yeah, yeah, I heard ya."
Enjoy your trip to the big city?
You gotta hit the next five to win.
Shit!
"I just hope you're not trying to prove anything, Freddy."
I know some of them are real assholes.
They think they're high priests or somethin'.
I don't know.
But why would they do all this?
Maybe they're doin' the right thing.
"Liz, I saw these pictures of Ray meeting with these guys."
"You know, like mobsters."
Everyone's houses are financed by these mob banks.
Says who?
IA?
Even you said Joey's death was no accident.
"Joey fell off a building, Freddy!"
Okay?
I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do.
I don't.
All Joey wanted was a place for us to live.
Who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
But now you've grown selfish and unkind.
"What's happened to your heart, jim?"
"It belongs to you, josie, just like you're going to belong to me."
Stop being afraid.
We've climbed above right and wrong.
"They're trying to pull us down, but they can't."
We're going higher and higher and higher!
Offering 150 for any part of 2 million!
"500,000 at 150!"
I'll take it.
Any more bids?
"If it breaks 160, it'll hit 200!"
We're not gonna let it break 160!
Jim!
She's just broke 150.
150?
157!
Why aren't you in the gold room?
"Oh, i'm getting jumpy, boss."
"I tell you, wall street's gone plumb crazy."
This thing's out of control!
Because i got 'em cornered!
I got all the gold there is outside the treasury.
"But i'm still buying, luke."
We can't hold anymore!
We're done for!
Let's get out of here while we're still alive!
I can't stay with you!
It's going to hit 200!
Stick with me!
You can't lose!
1621/2!
Am I as sexy and attractive to you as ever?
Huh?
Is this it for you?
Am I perfect?
"Well, ahem..."
I guess it wouldn't kill me if you lost a little weight.
Aha!
"Ok, and how much weight would it not kill ya for me to lose?"
I don't know.
50 pounds?
50?
All right!
Less!
Whatever.
You made me say it.
I can't believe you said 50!
"Doug, come on!"
You know I love you no matter-- ah...
This is-- this is unbelievable.
"You know, here I am walking around thinking everything's great."
"Meanwhile, you're smuggling in my clothes and hating the way I look!"
"No, I don't hate the way you look, ok?"
"But, yes, I admit it."
You could lose a little weight.
"But, Doug, come on."
I'm sure there are things about me you wish were different that you hold back on.
You?
"No, you're-- you're perfect."
"Yeah, right."
"Hey, look, when you start getting the old lady whiskers,"
"I'll let you know, but for now you're fine."
"Doug, come on."
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, Officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
"Oh, I'm not an officer."
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
He's a genius.
Right?
And you're his partner.
Partnerlbabysitterlassistant lbabysitter.
What's your name?
Natalie Teeger.
"Miss Teeger, I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
No.
"Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night and I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on TV?
I think you're a natural.
"No, I don't think so."
Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
I felt like Fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
Hi.
He just asked me to be the new lotto girl.
"Oh, only for one night."
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
Fitzgerald?
"Whoa, easy."
Where did he go?
Who?
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?
I have no idea.
Tell me or I'll take your head off.
I swear to God-- (GROANS)
Tell me.
Tell me!
Texas!
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.
Then he started talking about property.
"""A decent piece of land."""
One.
One of the same people.
"Oh, one."
So one's okay.
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.
"Oh, so now you want to micromanage something that you didn't even want to be involved in."
"I don't want to manage it, but don't you think we could maybe find someone competent who could?"
"Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know."
I'll tell you what's going on.
"Jonah saw Moyes earlier today and Dan and Amy have, too."
And now Moyes is onto us.
Why did you just tell me that?
This is so much worse for me.
I was the field agent who gave Dan and Amy the mission.
I was the messenger.
I could be shot.
- What's your name?
- Karen.
What?
"That's how you know a joke works, motherfucker."
"Oh, we're taking Karen."
"And, uh, we're leaving y'all with Nick Cannon."
So enjoy that shit.
I'm Jay Pharoah.
That's my time.
Thank y'all so much.

"Yeah, man!"

Get you some elbow.

"Well, I don't know, it was very catty."
Hmm.
"Now if you want to ask me any questions, you can ask me through your animal."
Do I have to speak in the animal language?
That's what I said.
"""Why were you at Simon Cowell's house?"""
I went to see Simon Cowell.
"""What was it about?"""
"Can we stop asking the same question, please?"
"Yes, sorry."
This is a place of respite and I wish to meditate.
"Now, I will offer you guys the chance to join me if you'd so like to."
Would you like to?
"Yes, we'd love to."
Take a seat.
Of course.
Love to.
"Meditation, have you done it before, Dermot?"
Right.
Now I sense that you two are searching for answers on the outside.
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Whose phone is that?
That's not my phone.
It's not my phone.
I gave Philip my phone.
It's coming from you.
Why can I hear it coming from this direction?
It's not my phone...
It's coming from here!
What's going...?
This is a smile.
"Yes, it is, 'cause you love your auntie Nai, don't you?"
Oh.
"Oh, isn't he beautiful?"
"When Maya was little, I used to just watch her breathe."
Isn't this the best?
Sure.
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry.
Who wants him?
It's Addison's turn.
"Oh, go, go, go."
Yes.
But you're coming back to me.
"Hello, Lucas."
He did just smile.
He smiled.
"Wow, this place looks different."
Pete...
I'm surprised to see you here.
"Unless you're my 2:15 appointment, in which case,"
I'm glad you're finally dealing with your kleptomania.
"Well, that's funny."
You're a funny guy.
"Look, I need to talk to you about Violet."
Are you sure this is a good time?
"Okay, I've been a little overprotective."
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term you want to use is fine.
I'm not here to argue with you.
"I told you when you brought her home from the hospital to her home, that was a mistake."
She wasn't ready to face the trauma.
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
"- Lf not mine, whose?"
"- Lf not now, when?"
Were you just talking about me?
"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
You told her?
She's not your wife.
"If I told you, you would've given it away."
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
"- No, but he would have read your face."
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
"Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
"I have to say, as a glasses- wearer, I take exception to that."
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
"Yeah, I've considered that."
"Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
"You know, we had a really bad breakup."
Who the fuck asked ya anything?
I didn't even ask ya anything.
At least wait to hear what I'm going to say.
"All right, what?"
"Ok, what."
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What the fuck is this world coming to?
I can't believe this.
"A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians."
"Anyway, she won't go out with me alone without her girlfriend."
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it. I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.
"I can't tomorrow night, I gotta meet Tuddy."
You could meet Tuddy.
You could fuckin' come early and then still go.
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this fuckin' broad.
You wanna help me out?
I don't understand you.
She's fuckin' beautiful!
Her fuckin' family they live in the Five Towns.
"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
[Cat purrs]
"Oh, you seem to have the touch."
[Cat yowls] Ow!
Majique!
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard."
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
"She's a good kitty, aren't you, Majique?"
[Purrs]
[Trunk slams] Hey.
Where's the body?
"First floor, room at the back."
- It's a little messy.
"- Well, what do you we know?"
"Uh, male, mid-40s."
Looks like somebody took a weed wacker to this throat.
Checked in three weeks ago under the name Nathaniel Adams.
"Clerk says he kept to himself, paid his rent, listed his home as New York City."
There was no sign of forced entry.
Maid discovered the body about an hour ago.
You weren't kidding about the weed wacker.
Looks more like a hatchet.
Except his head's still here.
- Who rolled the body?
- Nobody.
That's the way the maid said she found him.
"Well, this body's been rolled."
The pattern on the carpet matches the blood on his shirt.
That could have been the killer.
"There's no wallet, nothing in his pockets."
That's so mean.
"Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you."
Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up.
Fine.
"Okay, Gene."
You hold onto me.
Got it.
"Tina, you hold onto me."
Great.
And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom.
And pretend it's a person holding onto me.
Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy.
Okay.
We're ready.
Ah... no.
"Bang-up job, everybody."
We got the chocolate in the caboose.
Like we planned.
The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose!
At least we have toilet paper.
You guys want any?
Thank you.
Ugh!
"Well, we're stranded."
"Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles."
"My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either."
"Oh, wait..."
"no, that's a deer."
We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does.
"Guys, we're gonna be okay."
The train's coming right back here.
"Wait, what?"
I didn't know.
Let's have a listen.
Could you take those downstairs for me?
And this trunk has to go.
(STARTS PLAYING)
"Franz, Chopin's going out."
We'll come with you so we can talk.
I'm going to meet Madame Sand.
- This is wonderful!
- You play it better than I.
You're going on a trip?
Franz!
Chopin is going to meet Madame Sand.
Franz thinks you're making a mistake.
He's in a position to caution you.
He once had his own experience with George.
"- Marie, I told you nothing happened."
- So you love to claim.
"You must listen to him, because, one way or another,"
Franz knows exactly who she is.
GEORGE:
I've always wanted to know.
"See here, darling."
Chopin has dedicated the Etudes to you.
To me?
It is a tremendous honour.
"What did you do to deserve it, I wonder?"
Marie is an angel of inspiration.
"It's good to see you, Franz."
You should come back to Paris more often.
We all get into such trouble when you're away.
Where are you taking him?
I WANT A BALLPLAYER
WITH GUTS ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT BACK.
THINK YOU'VE GOT GUTS ENOUGH TO PLAY THE GAME
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS?
NARRATOR:
"BUT IT WAS A ONE-DIMENSIONAL PORTRAIT,"
HELPING TO SOLIDIFY MYTHS ABOUT ROBINSON
THAT WOULD PROVE STUBBORNLY HARD TO DISLODGE.
SO I HAUL OFF AND PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE CHEEK.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
"MR. RICKEY, I'VE GOT TWO CHEEKS."
GOOD.
[SPECTATORS CHATTERING]
NARRATOR:
"THAT SEASON, JACKIE'S ASSERTIVENESS"
BEGAN TO RANKLE MANY IN THE BASEBALL WORLD.
ROBINSON WAS CERTAIN THAT UMPIRES
WERE TREATING HIM DIFFERENTLY...
"MAKING BAD CALLS, TAUNTING HIM,"
THROWING HIM OUT OF GAMES WITH LITTLE PROVOCATION
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.
"LATER, THE ""SPORTING NEWS"" WOULD CALL HIM A ""CHRONIC GRIPER,"""
AND HE WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED
OF KICKING IN THE DOOR OF THE UMPIRES' DRESSING ROOM.
EARLY:
HE HAD A KIND OF FURY IN HIM.
"I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM"
TO SEE A BLACK MAN ARGUING AND BEING FEISTY.
IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT
THAN TO SEE THE ROBINSON THEY SAW AT FIRST.
NARRATOR:
"MEANWHILE, BRANCH RICKEY"
–Beauty.
You got the address?
"–Yeah, sure."
"–Oh, geez."
–Corrine...
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
- Just runnin' around.
- Who sent you down here?
Don't talk back.
- What are you doin' here?
- We saw the car.
We was breaking down the tyres.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
"Come on, come on!"
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves!
- Nothin' there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?
That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
Tear it out.
"Nothin' here, Jimmy."
This is all solid.
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
Enfiin on ne va pas passerlajournée ici.
Ça fait deuxheures qu'on estlá.
Soyez patient.
"Look, the car was lost sometime last night."
"First they send us to Pier One, then here."
Then what?
Why did you park the car down by the waterfront?
You're staying in midtown Manhattan and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television.
"I think treating her like a person, the kid's in love."
"You know, maybe she's in love with the possibility of something solid."
"I'm what she aspires to, a role model or something."
"Because if you're crossing the line, then it's you who's messing up."
"Yeah. I hear you, lieutenant."
LARSON:
"Hey, I gotta talk to you."
LlCALSl:
Okay.
"-What's going on, Janice?"
-Nothing.
Then how come the duty roster's paired me with Sackler?
Because I asked for a new partner.
-lf it's because I blew that undercover-- LlCALSl:
No.
LARSON:
Then what?
I don't think you are a safe or reliable partner.
-l can't believe I'm hearing this.
-You want it straight?
-You have a substance abuse problem.
-A what?
Substance abuse?
is that what your friend Kelly's saying?
"Okay, Roy, why don't we just drop this, okay?"
This is not about Kelly.
"And the thing I said, maybe I'm wrong."
All I know is that I'd feel...
... morecomfortablepartnering with somebody else.
-l can't argue with that.
-No hard feelings?
No.
"Buy yourself some new sandals, and a round of mouthwash for the table."
"All right, place your bets."
I placed mine on a liberal arts degree.
That's why I'm here.
Let it ride.
"Max, maybe we should quit while we're ahead since we've never been before."
Aren't you worried that we might... 18 again!
Keep winning and never die!
Let's go with four.
The number of men who have flashed me since I've been on this riverboat.
Lucky four!
No more bets.
Whoa!
Who's driving this thing?
Gary Busey?
"Oh, four."
No winners.
"Yes, winners."
"We had four, but then the boat moved our chips."
"Yeah, and it also spilled my soda."
So like I said:
No winners.
"Sure, we lost all our money, but at least you got to see some dongs."
"Hey, Sophie, it's me Car... ah!"
I fall for her...
"""Hello, this is Sophie"""
outgoing message every time.
We need them to send that money.
"Oh, thank God."
"Hi, Sophie, it's..."
What's going on here?
Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?
"Yes, sir."
He's been here for like 20 minutes.
"Oh, god, do they suck ass?"
And you're already dressed.
And what they're gonna do is they're
"Gonna bring you out through this side,"
And we're gonna put on your shoes.
Great.
"I'm gonna shoot with this guy, who's"
Half an inch taller than Mike in the 10-year-old fucking mask?
That's brilliant.
Who's fucking idea was that?
"Oh, that looks really great."
Motherfuckers.
INTERVIEWER:
What's that?
"They got the fucking 10-year-old mask on a 6'2"" guy."
MAN:
It doesn't look anything like-- we have a stunt man.
Somebody could have asked.
Anybody could have asked.
Somebody could have asked.
I had no idea they were shooting with it.
I'm sure--
I put together pieces of this makeup for a stunt man.
They don't care.
"No, they just don't fucking care."
They could do the rest of the movie with a 10-year-old
"Mask and 6'2"" guy."
Right?
Why not?
They just don't care.
"It's, um, hip."
"Or whatever the word for ""hip"" is now."
Yeah.
"Yeah, no, it... it works."
"I, um..."
I work here.
"Or I used to, before..."
I am starting again next week.
I'm sorry.
"I wanted to come back, but I just..."
"I couldn't, uh, get it together."
That's my fault.
"And then, your mom said that you weren't ready to... see me, so..."
Mom told you not to come?
She has her reasons.
I missed a lot.
But when I saw on the news what happened with your... with Piper...
We don't...
We don't have to get into that.
Being a survivor is painful.
Having to remember all of your friends' faces...
This isn't...
"I'm fine, honestly."
I need to ask you this one thing.
Anything.
I understand that you and Mom couldn't make it work.
I get that.
"Sometimes, people just don't fit together."
"And, now, I know what you went through with Piper."
"The lies, all of it."
I understand why you ran away from this place... but...
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)
I got addicted to one of those things.
Almost broke up my marriage.
What?
"Oh, no, no."
Not that.
"No, no, no, I met someone, and, you know, we had a nice time-- that's all there is to it."
"Wait, you're not going to see him again?"
"Maybe I will, and maybe I won't."
You can do that?
"Apparently, I can."
"Oh, crap."
Here comes Sad Dad.
Who's Sad Dad?
"Yeah, that's the other side of divorce."
"His wife left him three years ago for her personal trainer and he's been moping around the school ever since, trying to get any woman to show him the slightest bit of attention."
"Oh, that is so pathetic."
Which one is he?
Hey!
"Oh, my God, what are you doing here?"
You looking for me?
"Uh... uh, no, my kid goes to this school."
No way.
"My daughter, Alice, goes to school here."
Wow.
You would think that that would have come up last night.
"Oh, my God."
"No, no, no, no!"
Don't answer that.
Why?
Who is it?
Hi.
We're very busy.
Dave's right.
"I mean, you know, why go through with it just to get a divorce 2 weeks later?"
- Exactly.
- I think actually she just kinda got really overwhelmed.
"Uh, she saw Brian and then freaked out and left."
- Have you talked to her?
- No one has.
"So she hasn't spoken to them, and they haven't spoken to each other."
We ought to just invite Marjorie and have a really awkward barbecue.
That'd be awesome.
"Oh, that's me."
Where's my cell phone?
"Oh, uh, ooh, uh, here."
"Um, Suzanne."
Huh.
What is she doing calling on a Sunday?
"- Well, it's probably about the launch."
- Juice box.
"Leviathan's going to be calling a lot, you know."
- Hello?
"- Hey, handsome."
Hi.
"I'm, um, in the middle of a family/friend thing."
How do you know I'm not calling you about work?
I don't.
You're right.
"Um, what's up?"
- I got some ideas I want to pitch you.
- Okay.
How about tomorrow?
How about tomorrow night?
They'll probably sound better over a glass of wine.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
I didn't mean it.
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's my fault, you know."
What?
"Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole mess."
You know?
I forced him into getting married.
"- You know, he wasn't ready."
"- Janine, this isn't your fault."
"No, it is."
"It is, I've changed."
"I was fun, you know?"
I was fun when we first met.
You're still fun.
[SIGHS]
We don't have sex anymore.
Lots of couples go through lulls.
"No, I mean we never have sex."
[JANINE CRYING]
"I mean, realistically, what do I expect him to do, you know?"
I don't think that's really...
"God, this tile is too small."
I have to tell Javier.
- What?
- This tile is too small.
I gotta go.
"I have to take a personal day, if anyone asks."
MARIEL:
"Well, my first husband was unimpressive."
I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives.
"I beg your pardon, sir, for barging in."
- Get out of here!
"- I'm trying, sir."
"All right, I'll see that you do."
Wait here a minute.
MacGregor...
What the devil are you doing?
- Do you want to know who I am?
"- Yes, I do."
"Well, sir, see, I'm from the London Bureau of Boats, Barges, Brigs, all tethered bottoms and maintenance of, sir... that's it."
Maintenance?
This place is condemned.
I'm the last one.
Lucky you are.
"If you've got wet rot on the top, you've got dry rot on the bottom."
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.
Look at that.
- What...?
- Oh!
I'll see what I can do.
I'll put my report in... and I'll try and get them before they close.
"I haven't got a cork with me, so I'll be back later..."
"Terrible thing, you've got there."
"Dreadful thing, that."
"Terrible mess you've got there, terrible mess."
- Madam?
"- Some knock-out drops, please."
- Some...?
- Knock-out drops.
- You want a pick-me-up?
"- If I did, I would say so."
a book I believe both of these generals my be familiar with.
"Come on, rock star."
"Ok, it's on you, Joe."
"Ok, ok."
3 kings.
That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
Whoa!
Full house.
Marines have landed.
"Ok, I don't know if you're ready what I got right here."
"Oh, I think we're ready."
Because in the words of Mr. Withers...
Ain't no sunshine in these cards.
"Oh, man!"
"All right, all right, all right."
"No, wait."
We agreed 25% of every pot goes to the baby Morgan tuition fund.
Much appreciated.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"Where is this child going to school,"
Harvard and Yale?
"Hey, listen, I really appreciate you letting me rob you for the night, but, uh,"
I gotta get up out of here.
Come on come on.
For what?
You get 25% out of each pot just for sitting there.
"- Ok, look here, pops--"
- Said the weasel.
"Ok, ok, I clearly cannot compete at this table, but, uh, look, I gotta go hang out with wifey."
We're taking those Lamaze lessons.
You'd never met him?
"I've never seen him before this morning, hand to God."
"Look, the cops got it all wrong, man."
You know I would never do this.
You gotta believe me.
"You believe me, right?"
Yeah.
But it's not me you need to worry about.
"No, please, just don't tell Jackie."
"And it's not your sister, either."
Gibbs is my best agent.
Convince him.
"Tell him the truth, everything will be okay."
Minute's up.
No record.
This your first arrest?
First and only.
"I'm a good person, Agent Gibbs; ask Leon."
I'm not asking him.
I'm asking you.
"Well, I just meant he knows who I am."
He knows I'd never kill anybody.
Cops say they found you with blood on your hands.
I was trying to stop that kid from bleeding to death.
They said that you were asking skittish.
That you couldn't get your story straight.
They wouldn't let me talk.
I tried to tell them what happened.
They wouldn't listen.
They just assumed I was lying.
Okay.
I'm listening.
I stopped at Krispy Kreme donuts.
That's it?
.
"No, that's not it."
The hot light was on.
Feel these things.
They're practically radioactive.
"Please, don't ask me for details about Scott."
"Oh, I'm not going to."
"He's totally wrong for me, he's unpredictable, and his neck smells better than that bag of donuts."
"Apparently your hot light is on, as well."
"But if you don't want to talk about it, I'm certainly not going to probe."
I know you're a very private person...
- Sit.
- You are so easy.
Would this be the same Scott you kissed the other day?
The one your dad detests?
"Hmm, yep, that's the one."
Sleeping with the enemy.
I'm not sleeping with anyone.
And such a shame.
Like a Maserati up on blocks.
"Oh, it's my dad."
"When I left work today to sneak out with Scott, I told him I was coming down with something."
"Hey, Dad."
Sorry my voice is all...
"Yeah, sure, I'll hold for him..."
"Hey, Dad..."
"Yeah, a little."
"Yeah, I know."
A lot of fluids.
Okay.
"A thousand greetings to you, Terry, Dad,"
"Furface and Watersprite, from your loving Henry."
The main thing is he's alive and well.
Where does it say greetings to Furface and Watersprite?
Here.
He never forgets us.
Give him our love too.
"Of course, and I'll say how you help me."
"Come, let's feed you."
You need a rest after your long flight.
"But I'm not alone, really."
The Duke sent Henry away to fight the Turk.
The Turk?
But nobody came back alive!
"That's what the Duke thinks, that ghastly ugly wretch."
Ghastly?
Ugly'?
The nastiest under the sun.
He's mean to everyone.
"But he'll meet a just end, such a type always does."
But they praise him in town!
Our Duke?
Must be some mistake.
"The Count in Netolice maybe, he's a wonderful person."
"But our Duke is proud and evil, just about ripe for hell."
- Stop it!
- Don't you like our food?
Honza's used to better things - on his travels.
Johann!
Not Honza!
How about a nice roast chicken with sage stuffing?
"Just say so, Johann."
"-Good morning, Ernie."
-What is this?
"Come on, Ernie."
We've got work to do.
"What are you doing, taking bets?"
Transfer all of Mr. Morgan's calls up here...
I hope you don't think I was kidding last night.
-You're working for me.
"-Oh, come on, come on, you were"
-high last night.
"-Oh, not that high."
I didn't get where I am today by being high and making gaiety.
"I find that you're one of the top motor pool sergeants in the whole Army, and if you can unsnarl one-tenth of the jams that we get into, you're worth twice the $10,000 a year that I'm giving you."
"$10,000 a year?"
Fine.
Do that.
BILKO:
What are you talking about?
Ed Houlihan in Cleveland.
"-Oh, Houlihan again."
Yeah.
-(Houlihan speaks indistinctly)
"All right, now, look, Houlihan, get this straight."
I don't want 22 trailer trucks laying dead all over the road.
What?
You're waiting for some chain drive parts
-to get down from Seattle?
-Let me tell him.
Let...
-What?
-Just a minute.
What are you talking about?
- He hates you.
He hates you.
- Getaway from him.
Getaway.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
"Lucy, did you hear me?"
What?
I asked you if you were upset because Bruce left.
Am I ever gonna get out?
Are you getting sick of me?
What I'm getting sick of is Fish-Stick Fridays.
"You will be leaving at some point, yes."
But our sessions don't have to end.
I would like to be a regular part of your life.
What life?
- Lucy.
"- No, no, you don't understand."
I know what my life should look like.
I know that I should be in school and starting my career and going on dates and making out in inappropriate places but I'm never gonna be able to do that.
I have something for you.
Torts.
Funny.
"You know, that's what drove me crazy in the first place."
That book didn't cause your psychosis.
Law school didn't cause your psychosis.
Didn't help.
Why did you wanna be a lawyer?
I'll call you tonight.
"Won't you sit down, Miss Kelly?"
My money do all this?
"Yes, your money and my brains."
Except that it wasn't your money.
You stole it from me.
To steal from a thief is no crime.
"Look, I'm broke because of you."
"Well, how would you like a job?"
Doing what?
Working for me.
I could use a pretty thief in my business.
I'd wind up in jail.
Not my way you wouldn't.
Yours for sure.
I'd be no use to you.
I'm not really a thief.
I saw you pull a little job.
"Small stuff, but it showed promise."
The wallet dropped on the floor.
I was tempted.
I was broke.
I never dreamed of picking up that wallet would end that way for Chuck.
He tried to kill me.
He loved me.
He was just trying to help me.
"You know, you and I are very much alike."
"Oh, we're both crooks."
Only there's one difference.
I don't want to be.
And you can't help yourself.
I like you.
Read this morning's operations printout?
What about it?
I was with Vinnie Zapatti last night.
He's dead because of Tino Zapatti's probation report.
Now there's four deaths.
They're connected.
-That's all I know--
-That's all I wanna know!
-Just trying to circle the wagons.
-Circle the wagons?
Who do you think you are?
Some gumshoe in a dime novel...
... loose-cannoningaroundthecity?
Consorting with known mobsters!
"Kevin, for God's sakes!"
You're the mayor's right-hand!
What are you fucking around for?
You see this desk?
"It belonged to Fiorello La Guardia, """"the little flower. """""
He was about 5 foot tall.
Used to read the funny papers to children over the radio...
... andwasabout the best mayor the city ever had.
Know what La Guardia said?
"""""Why is it every time you can do some good..."
"... thenicepeoplecomein and mess you up?"""""
Be nice.
Don't mess me up.
-Did I wake you up?
-You kidding?
"I've been trying to figure out how to raise $1 0,000."
"The hook is in, and I'm close."
Vinnie is Eddie's passport...
My memory is like a 70-year-old granny's.
I always leave my phone in the office once or twice a day.
I'm one of the better cases.
One of my colleagues has a neck brace for her phone.
What?
You said that we don't have enough time.
Let's use it wisely.
Is something wrong?
"I know you could be angry, but you shouldn't be this mad."
What's wrong?
Did you order steak?
They are cold.
-It's ok.
"-Leave them, I'll order again."
I can see stars already.
-I said leave them.
-You said there's no time.
Let's just eat.
Sit!
There's salad.
"Bread, plenty to eat."
"Oh yeah, I should drink wine first."
When you called me stupid my stomach got upset.
Even stupid people get shocked from that.
Did you know that I was stupid now?
"This isn't the first time you were called ""stupid."""
"That ""stupid"" was different from ""stupid"" before."
Aren't you going to drink?
You have to drive?
So do I.
A glass will be ok within an hour.
It shows.
"You'll find out what's wrong, won't you?"
- You said you could.
"- Sure, my love."
"And you've always got me, in case of need."
Or did you want us both?
"No, I'm not like that."
Not the one and the other.
- lt's more either/or.
- Either/or?
What are you two either/or-ing?
"Gerard asked me about my morning, and I have to work."
"It's either working, or neglecting the salon."
Working?
Today?
I've taken the whole damned week off for you!
"It's just this morning, sweetheart."
Monday mornings I have to see my salesmen. I'll be froe this afternoon.
That's great!
I'll be bored to tears meanwhile.
- Do something with Gerard.
- He's here to work too!
So I don't work this morning.
Yes... show him around.
Or talk to him.
Perhaps he'll write about us.
Then we'll be in a book.
What's the use of being in a book?
You know what?
Take the car.
I don't need it anyway.
Shall we?
I have to get to the meeting.
You sent that to Tyler.
(screams)
I can't go home.
I can never go home again.
It can't be that bad.
Whoa.
I have never even seen this on the Internet.
You watch that kind of stuff on the Internet?
Sometimes.
Don't you?
"No, it's blocked at my house."
"I thought it was because of my dad, but now I'm wondering if it's because of my mom."
Hmm.
You'll be fine.
"My dentist accidentally sexts me, like, once a week."
Ooh.
You know what I'm gonna do?
"I'll look him in the eye and I'll just say,"
"""Hey, autocorrect completely changed the grocery list I gave your dad."""
"Well, not completely."
"I mean, ""cream"" and ""meat"""
could have stayed the same.
"God, Tim, why?"
Why aren't you helping me with this?
!
"I'm sorry, honey."
"I'm just enjoying this too much because, for once, it's not me who screwed up."
"Okay, you know what I need?"
I-I need the advice...
of a professional.
Did I do this to you?
Did I make you like this?
I don't care!
Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Why did you come back?
Leave me alone!
Chun-su.
What do you want?
I looked into the tax collection in the village.
"In all, we've paid over 70% of our harvest in taxes."
I bet there is not another saltern city in the country that paid so much!
I'm going to...
Give it up!
Chun-su...
What's this going to change?
Will it bring my father back?
Don't make me in a difficult spot and give it a rest.
Chun-su...
"I don't want anything to do with this, so give it up."
Soon-shin.
Mother...
Where are you going so early?
What are you up to?
And what's that written in that book?
Mother...
A friend's father is dead.
"And if I don't do something, my friend may not be safe either."
But this isn't something you can resolve.
I know.
"I know what's scaring you, Mother."
But I have to do this.
"If I don't, I'll never forgive myself."
Soon-shin!
Let me see.
Come on.
Turn around.
"You know, Bob, It's the third day of your diet... and that weight is just... falling off."
"- I'm, surprised you recognize me."
- Yeah.
- Something smells good.
What is it?
"- Oh, it's not for you, honey."
It's for the company.
I know you don't like lasagna.
That's why I made it.
"Well, if I don't like it, why does it smell so good?"
"- What, what do I get?"
"- Oh, it's over there on that dish."
It looks so lonely and so small.
Is this all I get to eat?
"Oh, no, honey."
You get a big salad with lemon juice and a big glass of water.
"Great. if I want seconds, I'll just, rattle my cup against the bars of my cell."
"Oh, honey."
It's not that bad.
You can have some of the hors d'oeuvres.
"Oh, good."
"No, no."
Not those.
The ones with the yellow toothpicks in them.
- The yellow toothpicks.
- Yeah.
"Oh, honey."
"I know it's rough, but it's worth it, isn't it?"
"- Emily, come here."
She was first in the room.
"I followed immediately after, sir."
Who's Miss Kelly?
"She works for Mr. Sabourin, sir."
Yeah?
And where should she be found?
"She's in his mother's room, sir."
You mean his mother lives here with him?
"Just since she came from Europe, yes, sir."
Let's look over the rest of the room.
Show me his personal things.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
It couldn't have been robbery.
"Yeah, if it was they overlooked a lot of cash and jewelry in these boxes."
"Diamond cufflinks, diamond rings, women's jewelry."
"Look at this, gold handcuffs."
Must be a dozen of them in here.
"Yeah, they're all over town."
He liked to think his women were his slaves.
Show me his mother's room.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
I'm sorry to break in.
We're police.
I'm her doctor.
You can't disturb her now.
He can ask me anything he wants.
"I'm sorry I have to do this, mam."
But do you know anything about this?
No.
I know nothing about who killed my son.
"Well, I've got $50 that says you can't get one past me out there."
What do you say?
Ls that a yes?
"You know, I've got the lowest goals against in Pennsylvania history, right?"
Wow!
That's really funny because I've scored the most in Pennsylvania history.
"Yeah, but for girls."
Come on.
Combined.
All right.
Let's go.
And this.
Let's go.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Let's go.
"Come on, you got better than that."
"Let's go, you're the MVP girl."
"Oh, man."
I could get you in a game.
You just need to be distracted.
"Trust me, watching you shoot in that shirt is distracting enough."
So?
Ls this feng shui hockey for real?
"We got gear, uniforms and our fees paid."
"And they can run the practises, but we'll still play the games my way."
- So lots of skating and no scoring?
- That is harsh.
"You open with the Hounds, Saturday."
Drop the Zen crap.
Control the blue line and put me on the roster.
Then you'll have a shot.
"They tend to be pen snobs, strictly Montblanc and beyond."
Why does he creep you out?
- He doesn't creep me out.
"- Yes, he does."
You get a bad vibe from the guy.
- It's complicated.
- Tell me.
I like complicated.
Ari does a great deal of independent reading.
You can see she's excited by the idea of fiction.
It's one of the things that makes her a good student.
- So you're taking my wife out.
- Uh...
Sorry?
"Well, you're going out with my wife."
"To, uh, some book event?"
"Right, right."
The book signing next week.
"An event for an author we both like, Leonard Addams."
Leonard Addams.
Do you...?
Do you think he's good?
I like some of his stuff very much.
"Ella's a fan, too."
"Well, I think he's a fake."
Very overrated.
He has his critics.
He certainly wouldn't fit in to what I'm trying to do with Aria's class.
Is he really your idea of a good writer?
"Well, I like a lot of writers for a lot of different reasons."
Hmm.
"Ha, ha."
- I may pass out here.
"- No, you won't."
- Do you know CPR?
"- Uh, n-no."
You're gonna need to take my right arm and put it across my chest.
Okay.
Make sure I don't roll over.
Then what do I do?
You're gonna have to give me mouth-to-mouth.
I'm sorry I said those things about the way you live.
I was scared.
It's like Allie said--people get mean when they get scared.
All right.
"She's a wonderful girl, Lisa."
You did great.
"You want CNN here so badly, why don't you call 'em yourself?"
"Because they'd just think he was crazy, and he wants everyone to know that he isn't crazy at all."
( cell phone rings )
Yeah?
Okay.
The media'll be here in 15 minutes.
"We're almost home, fruit loops."
( gunshot )
( everyone screams )
Get down.
Who took that shot?
( cell phone rings )
What the hell do you think you're doing?
!
What'd you think would happen if you tried something like that?
It was a miscommunication.
I'm sorry.
He's just sabotaging himself.
He's sabotaging this account that would mean so much to us and... I can't even say anything--
"Oh God, Patty."
What would I do?
"I mean, how would I survive?"
"Camille, Camille, it's okay, honey, you're going to be okay."
"No, you don't understand, I need him. I'm not like you."
"Wait, wait, what am I like?"
"I didn't mean that, I just mean I need him, I really need Andy to live."
This is incredible.
Right. I'm sorry that...
H i.
We can go downstairs.
"No, lt's fine. I was just..."
- l should probably go.
- No.
"No, don't go."
"- So, your room is..."
- A mess.
Different from the last time I saw it.
"Okay, well, I'm going."
I'm on hold.
"Rosenfeld, I got to call him back."
Good morning.
How long have you been up?
A while.
You can have the first shower if you want.
"That's okay, you go ahead."
There's nothing edible in here.
"Don't be ridiculous, sweetie."
That things crammed full of stuff.
Let me look.
"(SCREECHING, ROARING)"
(MARSH):
Judy.
"Oh, for Pete's sake."
(MARSH):
What on Earth has gotten into you anyway?
"Dad and Mike, don't jump at Judy so."
I'm not jumping at Judy.
She's just been acting up.
First stealing my hat.
Now twisting Clarence's tail.
And not only that.
She has been poaching bananas from the fruit bowl.
Oh?
"You know, young lady,"
I think a few days in a cage might do you some good.
(SCREECHES)
"Oh, come on, you guys, stop picking on her."
"Oh, I'm not picking on her."
"Ah, she's just picking on the whole world."
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)
"Hello, Hedley, what's up?"
More a question of what's down.
"Have you been listening to the radio reports of Sally, the American astro-chimp?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, we listened to the blast-off last week"
- from Cape Kennedy.
- It certainly was exciting.
"Judy, you remember my telling you about the chimp taking the ride around the moon."
(CHATTERING)
"Last we heard, she had returned and was due to splash down in the South Atlantic"
- about an hour ago.
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"Ifl don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now-- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... ifyou are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Hereyou go, Doug."
My luckyvest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in foryou.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think ofit as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
- Yeah.
"If Vlad wants his crazy Mexican, he should go after him."
It's pissing me off.
The last girl is off with a client.
"Down, down, down!"
He's gonna get a blow-job here.
"Fuck, he must be desperate to get a woman here."
What do you care?
You don't come here on holiday.
You're right.
I forgot that you were an expert.
You're out of line.
"Fuck, you're becoming a pain, Gilou."
- We can't say anything any more.
- Don't worry.
You'll soon be rid of me.
And Laure?
Tell me it doesn't hurt to leave her.
"Me, I would understand, but Laure?"
"Go ahead, say it."
Say it!
They're moving.
Gilou to Laure.
"The guy is going away with the girl, what do we do?"
We follow?
"No, we wait."
They're done.
Let's go.
Why don't they come back?
Are you sure the pimps didn't pick them up?
They must have picked them up somewhere else.
"We'll come back tonight, we've got to stay on their back."
"Everybody, get some sleep."
It's just hard not to feel that everybody is when you' re lying in the street with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
I've never seen it like this.
"It's okay, there will be a later bus."
Yeah.
"That's not your music, that's Abby's."
She always liked that noise.
I'm getting used to it.
There's an accident up ahead.
"Sit tight, we'll keep you posted."
- Thank
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Well...
"- Thank you for this, John."
- I know it's a huge inconvenience.
- It's no problem.
I'm sorry for getting so upset.
I hate being so pathetic.
Just the idea of going home alone and waiting...
- Eric will turn up.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but I worry about both of them."
Abby's good.
"You know, we' re both good."
You don't have to worry about that.
She told me.
She told me you might get married.
- Is that what she said?
"- No, she told me you proposed."
"I know she's work, it runs in the family, but she's so worth it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because of Mum?
Right.
Do you want me to get rid of them?
'Cause I will if it's bugging you?
"How about you just keep the music down a bit, OK?"
"Thanks George, you're the best."
Good work Dad.
(PARTY MUSIC IN OTHER ROOM)
Hey Shay.
"Gotta love your brother, right?"
He doesn't give up.
"You do know what a lost cause is, right?"
Mm-hm.
"Except it's not, is it?"
"You know it, I know it, so why avoid the inevitable?"
Because maybe I want more for myself?
"Not to be one of the Lindsays of this world, hanging off some random guy's every word to fill the void of my existence."
"Yeah, but I'm not some random guy, am I?"
But you might as well be.
Dad?
"It's time, Dad."
Time for what?
We want our house back.
Fair enough.
Alright everyone!
Just...
"Sorry to break up the party everyone but it's time to move it elsewhere, please."
Sorry.
"Thanks for having us, Mr T."
It's been spiritual.
"Yeah, thanks Ollie."
No worries mate.
Sis!
Look!
You're right!
It's really beautiful!
"It's been a while since you have looked like this, Sis!"
Really?
Yeah!
You looked like this for a long time!
Was it really like that?
It looks lke you became her wind.
Eh?
"To that kid, your point of view is like a wind to the fog around her."
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Don't worry about it.
"More importantly, did you bring what you wrote?"
"Yeah, I did."
I am still good friends with Saho-san.
Saho-san's smoke will never vanish.
It only disappears for a little while.
"It's weird, but I really feel like I understand your stories, Hibara-san."
Thank you.
"When we talk, Saho-san's smoke sometimes vanishes."
I am happy even if I can only become Saho-san's wind every so often.
"I really don't like when the seasons change, because they start to come out."
HA HA HA!
I'm not worried about it!
What's with that weird confidence you have?
!
"Could it be that it happened again, Mizuki?"
!
Yeah!
But this time...
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
It's not like you're one of them.
Schanke...
um...
What would you say if...
What would you say if I told you that I was an addict?
"[LAUGHS] Yeah, right, and I'm the Maharishi."
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, I'm serious."
"I'm talking to you, here, okay?"
Seriously.
An addict?
"Wait, wait, we're not talking about the red wine in the refrigerator, are we, because..."
"No, no, no, absolutely not."
"You're perfectly all right, Nick."
You're perfectly fine.
Absolutely not.
Trust me.
[LAUGHS]
So much for step number one.
Yeah?
What's step number two?
[POURING]
"Hi, my name's Nick, and I'm an addict."
"It's the hunger that drives me, and it's not for, um... for booze, or crack, or junk."
"It's for, um..."
I drink blood so that I can live forever.
LACROIX:
What's so terrible about that?
"You have to fight it, Nick."
You don't have to listen to him.
"She's right, Nicholas, don't listen to me."
Listen to your hunger.
Listen to the beast in your veins calling to you.
- l don't know anything.
- Not even the shake?
That's the first time I've heard of it.
- Would you like to dance?
- Are those sandwiches good?
Excellent.
"But if you want to dance, go ahead."
"Come on, what are you afraid of?"
I don't know what to do with my feet.
"No one else knows any better, don't be silly!"
But they know I can't dance.
You're not a little boy.
We're already in the ninth form.
"We are, but I don't know how to."
What does that matter.
Do you think anyone knows?
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.
"No one knows, they just jump around."
"Come on, what harm can it do?"
"If I don't know how to dance, I won't."
Excuse me. I'll tidy myself up a bit.
My wife...
- What is it?
- Come in!
Come in!
This is my wife.
"If you don't mind, I'll change."
"I'll take this T-shirt off, it reminds me..."
"This way, please."
They've come about...
- l don't know what.
- Your son.
Cut it out!
Stop being a clown.
"He just got here, I'd Iike to see you in his shoes, if they treated you Iike that."
"Mattia and I grew up together, he's a good kid."
- But he can't insult me.
- He has an Oedipus complex.
personal problems can't be dumped on others.
You won't really report him!
I can't let it slip by.
It's like he's still a kid.
"Go along, I'II lock up."
"And tell Mr. VoIpe I'm sleeping at my house, even on the floor."
Mr. Director!
Where are you going?
- Home.
- It's the otherway.
We'II take you there.
- What'II you do to me?
- We'II take you home.
- See you tomorrow.
"- No, we gotta take you inside."
help!
What were you thinking?
Who's there?
- What's happened?
- Why are you here?
"Don't be afraid, we wanted to surprise you."
Each of us gave something.
"It's make-shift, but it's okay for a start."
It's wonderful.
It's beautiful.
"It's so nice of all of you, even pictures!"
And...what about my headband?
I... admire it.
And...my stockings?
Oh I adore them.
And my dress?
I worship it.
How do you feel about me?
Say it.
I...
- What is it now?
- Oh not again.
Serena Van Der Woodsen
Just couldn't leave well enough alone.
Since she had to find out the truth about me
I'm going to tell you the truth about everyone.
Every gossip bomb I've got is about to drop
"And if you've got a problem with that,take it up with her."
Ever wonder why Miss Carr left town?
A little bee told me Dan Humphrey had sex with her
During the school play.
Remember the sparks between Humphrey's sis and Nate?
Oh my God.
During a hot photo session.
Thank God it stopped at pg-13
Or someone could have ended up in jail like her brother.
Is that true?
What?
You were in jail?
"And as for Blair Waldorf say ""uncle."""
We hear she kept it in the Bass family on new year's.
but rumor has it Chuck spent some time in Brooklyn--
Metaphorically speaking of course.
- he's left the country?
"- On the contrary, sir."
"He's here in this room, sir."
Your banker's draft Sir Arthur
How did you know?
You smelt of Turkish tobacco - a kind you can't get in Spain.
You didn't touch your pork at the monastery
And remember speaking Yiddish in the coach?
"Sir, you are an edel mensh."
A gentleman
"Did you know about that banner, sir?"
"Well, I knew you'd risk your life for the army's wages, but I couldn't count on superstition."
Time to go.
"Hasta otra, Richard."
No.
Sir Arthur's pleased as punch.
"So you say, sir."
"Say, is it?"
And don't I have your promotion for first lieutenant in my pocket.
Wellesley's going to take the army into Spain.
"It'll be bugles, battles and bags of glory."
"Stick with me, Richard."
I'll see you right.
"You'll see me dead, sir."
That's my boy!
"Oh, well done, Pat."
Well done.

"- Hey, Katie."
- Mm-hmm?
"Why don't you sit your bottom here, next to me?"
"Oh, Vali, I think I'm going to go ahead and probably sit next to anyone else."
Fair enough.
- I'll sit there.
- Okay.
Mom.
Do you want to go ahead and sit next to me?
Oh!
I would love that.
"Hey, I'm sorry things got awkward with us today."
Let's just start over.
"Happy Thanksgiving, Greg."
"Oh, happy Thanksgiving."

You just unhooked my bra.
That's not even a thing I can do if I'm trying!
"Oh, Greg."
"The one time a year we get little marshmallows on sweet potatoes, and you're too high to put them on the table."
I made a lot of bad decisions yesterday.
You're telling me.
You left the oven on all night long.
You could have burned down the house.
I also left the sink on.
It would have put out part of the fire.
Oh.
No!
"No, no, no, no, no!"
What?
"Apparently, I also agreed to make an ""Amazing Race"" audition video with my mom."
"Always say no to drugs, Katie."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.

- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
- You are the...?
- That's right.
I am the babysitter.
"Yes, yes."
Thank goodness that you've come.

"They tried to kill him like you said, but he got away."
Now he's runnin' through the woods.
He's like a scared animal.
He's scared to death.
That motherfucker should be scared.
His uncle got this case closed with one phone call.
"I'm sorry it took so long for me to come around, but you were right."
I couldn't see the truth.
"Like you said, the evidence, my loyalty, they were confusing."
They never give you any napkins in this place.
What am I supposed to use?
You want this?
What is this?
"You came to me, to my town... with all these speeches, talking about doing the right thing."
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on?
What are you doing?
That was like two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
- What about Babitch?
- What about him?
Fuck him.
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.
What about Joey Randone?
Shepherd.
Might as well do it on your watch.
Grey's Anatomy Season 5 Episode 12 Sympathy for the Devil
Why do you have to live in Meredith's attic?
How am I supposed to sneak out of here with that frat party going on downstairs?
Don't you kids ever sleep?
They're cleaning the house for dr.
Shepherd's mother.
Mrs. Shepherd is coming?
- To Seattle?
- So?
"So that woman practically raised me, taught me right from wrong, and if she found out that I was..."
"With you, that we were..."
You're Meredith Grey's little sister.
You are forbidden fruit.
You are 25.
- You're a fetus.
- 24.
I skipped third grade.
I feel dirty.
10 bucks that she tanks in the first 5 minutes.
I have faith in Death.
She'll make a good impression.
She's holding that bottle of tequila like it's a life vest.
"Mer, don't listen to them."
- She's gonna love you.
- No.
Mothers don't love me.
Mothers like bright and bubbly and happy and...
Izzie.
Mothers love Izzie.
They do.
- Go ahead.
- Short and sweet.
"I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live."
- Imagine the ratings.
"- I'd like to see you try, asshole."
- You're gonna see me.
"- I'll kill you, I swear to God!"
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You treacherous little bitch!
You got one week to get your shit together.
- You listening?
I want the money.
- [Door Slams]
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay, let's do a little math."
"You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything."
"I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again!"
Dale's money comes out of your share.
He's your friend.
- Not my friend.
He's his friend.
- I hardly know the man.
Who cares?
It's all fucking moot now.
The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue.
"You get a toothache, you pull the tooth."
What does that mean?
- Let's kill the son of a bitch.
"- Oh, God!"
- [Crystal] Yes!
- No!
It doesn't come up that often.
Maybe it's the neighborhood.
T om.
-Larry.
-Wow.
"Well, it's not the battery."
"In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump."
"You know, it could be your plugs are worn down."
I'll replace them for you in the morning.
"In the meantime, uh... could I give you a ride home?"
"Um, no, I can walk."
"So, what do you think?"
Can you help him?
I'd much rather do something for you.
"Well, what could you do for me?"
"Well, it seems like you've forgotten just about everything."
"Well, I remember the basics..."
but it's...
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's Frank I'm worried about.
"You know, it's just not that important to me anymore."
Poor man.
Look at that woman.
"Oh, my God."
Her top is so low.
And her skirt is so high.
That is bad.
It is.
"It's very, very bad."
"Are you, uh... what I think you are?"
"Well, I'm not the public health nurse."
Would you...
You'll have to kill him.
Get my diamond before killing him.
I want that diamond at any cost.
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.
I'm hearing a name that scary for the 1st time.
"Time is not good, let's go to the village."
We are in the village.
"Let's go to the city, Car is here."
I will kill him slowly.
Make a bomb.
Which blows.
"Laxminarayan will come, but he won't go back."
Listen to me carefully.
I've seen an old car on the internet.
"How is it, Sir?"
I want to buy this car.
Leave for Pondi now.
Check the car and give 1 lac as advance.
I will mail you the details.
"Which mail, Sir?"
"Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes very quick."
Fool.
I'll fax you from the computer turn on the fax machine.
"There are two fax machines here, which one, Sir."
Left or right?
Left.
Your left or my left?
My left.
"Which position are you in, Sir?"
Can't see on the phone.
This is your last chance.
Blair Waldorf just got a text.
It's like watching lady gaga set fire to a piano!
Who's it from?
Serena.
"Apparently, Jenny Humphrey is claiming squatter's rights"
On her old room.
It's disgusting.
"Oh, my God."
Jenny can't do that to Serena van Der Woodsen.
So what's the plan of attack?
It's between Serena and Jenny.
"Anyway, I've had some recent bad luck"
Getting involved in real estate disputes.
So I was thinking Warren-Tricomi mani/pedis?
I told you.
It doesn't matter if she transfers.
Blair Waldorf was over
The minute she became a student at N.Y.U.
Are you third personing me?
"I third person people, not you!"
Exactly.
"You're Blair Waldorf- fashion icon, queen b."
And probably the future President of the United States.
Or Chanel.
Jenny Humphrey just kicked Serena van Der Woodsen
"Out of her room, and you're not gonna do anything?"
I would.
I just don't have any dirt on Jenny right now.
Ahem.
I do.
Jenny and her boyfriend sold my boyfriend Adderall
A couple of months ago.
She ain't bad.
"Yeah, she's the chick, all right, but she don't wanna do it."
"Well, shit, I'll go somewhere else."
"Now, now, wait a minute."
"If we discipline her a little, she'll be glad to do it."
"You'd like to watch that, wouldn't you?"
- Yeah.
- No!
[Whimpering]
[Laughing]
"Eh, can I, uh... yeah, but it's gonna cost you extra."
"Yeah, all right."
Go get your toy.
"No, ah!"
[Whimpering]
No... no!
"No, no."
[Gasping]
"No, no."
"Oh, please!"
[Screaming]
Do you have to get up early?
"I'm supposed to have the day off, but, uh, you never can tell."
What's your day like?
"So far, so good."
"Yes, Al, we're ready on the floor."
Twenty seconds to air.
"Mic up, over there."
"Sit down, here we go, in ten..."
"Five, four, three, two... good morning, I'm rodger grimsby."
"Here now, the news."
"Early today, the grisly remains of a reputed meat mobster, gino pontivini, were found on the floor of a warehouse in the South Bronx, beneath a huge meat grinding machine."
"Yeah, tell me about it."
That's my wife Olivia.
"Awesome, bone structure."
- She's lovely.
- Glad you think so.
We were hoping you'd join us for a drink back at our place.
"And your wife, is she okay with that?"
"My wife is an Erinys, a Fury."
I wouldn't flirt if she didn't give me say so.
"In fact, you're her choice, and I wholeheartedly agree."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"Girl, are you a Succubus or a succu-bust?"
A rebound screw is the greatest way to get over a guy.
-It's just science.
- I told you.
I never cared that much about Dyson anyway.
My place.
Let's go.
It's coming ...
We're gonna need a safe word.
Gold star for Kenzi.
Rebound sex was exactly what I needed.
Why do you look like you're not at all sharing this monster hangover?
What can I say?
"For me, sexual healing is a literal thing."
I hate you.
And there's no strings attached.
- That was the best idea you ever had.
- You're very welcome.
And you're back.
I'll read it to you.
"""Dear Karen, just a note to thank you for your cooperation"""
"""in helping to keep Bob here."""
"""I don't know what the school would do without him,"""
"""or for that matter, what I would do without him."""
"""I will return the favor someday."""
"""Gobs of love, Gretchen."""
"Why, that dirty double-crosser."
What did I tell you?
I'd do anything to help Bob go overseas.
So would I.
"Oh, I mean, I would like to help him out, too, 'cause he's a very nice fellow."
I have an idea.
"Look, how would it be if you and I wrote another letter to Colonel Blair's wife, and in that letter..."
"No, but we would change all the words our way."
No.
How would it...
"Oh, I know."
We'll have Gretchen phone Colonel Blair's wife.
"Say, that's great."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Gretchen would never do that.
And I have a sneaking suspicion that's exactly what she's going to do.
Here.
Huh?
Dormitory.
Okay.
Hello?
WOMAN:
"The time, please."
The time?
The time is exactly 7:57.
"Soon, I imagine."
Good.
I will wait.
"So I wait and wait and wait and wait, and still she doesn't come or call or anything."
What makes you so sure she didn't know you were there and why?
What kind of talk is that?
"- Please, Carl."
- Please what?
Why do you need a woman to do things for you?
To ask about things?
This is none of your business.
"Well, you sure don't need help from the lady who fixed up your contract with Somers in the first place."
You be quiet!
"Oh, stop it, Axel."
Both of you.
Stop it.
"So, what about you, Lisa?"
"You think I'm becoming a mouse, too?"
Huh?
All right!
I show you!
I show everybody!
[ring]
"I'll get it, Della."
Mason speaking.
"No, no, you just caught me."
We've been working late.
"Mr. Mason, you'll be in your office first thing in morning, yes?"
"Well, I'll be here, but I have a calendar full of appointments."
Cancel them.
I be there at 9 sharp.
And then you fix Somers for me.
What?
Am I wrong?
honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on Iine to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'II wait in the car.
"well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
really?
That is so sweet.
"also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
"Gigi, he's not coming."
But you can tell me the story about the molars.
I'd love to hear it.
Hey.
How could he already not like me?
I screwed up.
"I told Bill it was Thursday, not Tuesday."
It's my fault.
Hi.
Are you good?
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.
GIGI:
Awesome.
I'm stuck with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.
"Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak."
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.
"Oh, God, no."
How do you know?
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?
"She's interested, he's clearly not."
You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not into her.
"Actually, I can."
I see this stuff going on every night.
Watch this.
She's going on about her macrobiotic diet.
"He's thinking, ""Dear Christ, get me out of here."""
"And look, how fortuitous."
"Drinks spill, which is perfect for him, because now..."
He can move on to the girl with the shoulder tattoo.
"Man, you have a gift."
He was an exciting guy.
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.
And he knew how to handle it.
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.
Morrie's wigs don't come off!
Even underwater.
"And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds."
"So, forget about money."
You can afford a Morrie wig.
Prices to fit every budget.
So call me now!
And come in for a personalized fitting.
"Morrie, Jimmy's waiting."
You're past due.
I've been good to you.
But there's something quite unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being an unconscionable ball breaker.
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.
I never had to pay the vigorish that he demands.
"What am I, a schmuck on wheels?"
"Please, you know Jimmy."
You borrowed his money.
Pay him.
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?
He wants his money.
Give him his money and let us just get the fuck outta here!
Hey...
Fuck him!
If I didn't know better....
"-We're off the record here, Albert."
-We're off the record?
It's Tony.
What?
Am I wrong?
Honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?

Centuries of tradition here.
Exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack Ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on line to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'll wait in the car.
"Well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
Really?
That is so sweet.
"Also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
"You know, it's how people are supposed to feel when they fall in love."
"Of course, I never have."
I wish I could be so sure of what I wanted to do.
You must have some idea.
No.
"No, I've thought of everything, but nothing seems to fit me."
Maybe I'll be unique and retire at the age of 18.
"Norman, it's about time you got home."
"Hello, Ms. Page."
"- Goodbye, Norman."
"- Wait just a minute, will you?"
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.
"Norman, what an awful thing, hating to go home."
Come on in here.
"Well, thanks for walking with me."
"I enjoyed it, really."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"- May I walk on it, Nellie?"
"- Sure, it's dry by now."
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.
You two have a fight again?
"Same fight, different round."
- Nellie?
- Yeah.
You've been both a daughter and a mother.
Which one is worse?
- Being a mother.
- Why?
You find yourself doing the same things you hated your own mother and father doing.
You'll cripple her!
She was swimming when I came.
Swimming?
Don't cry.
- The yokel.
What is it you want?
"I'm a miller's apprentice, I'm looking for work."
I mean for a roof over my head...
Where did you work last?
Here and there and everywhere!
"I know who he is, Froggy!"
"I heard you need a helper, so I came."
"We do, but are you any good?"
You don't look like a hard worker to me.
But I am!
And I can sing and dance!
"It's him, I smellt him, it's him!"
- You wait!
- You...
Haven't we met before?
You look familiar.
Impossible.
"We have a new helper, what do you think?"
"Why, daddy?"
I can get my work done.
I don't want a stranger around.
"Beautiful E- er, you'd work herself to death you need a helper I can do all sons of things,"
you won't be sorry.
All right.
We'll give him a try.
"There's plenty to do, even with our two helpmates."
"A devil and watersprite, like in every real mill."
"No cause for alarm, Robin."
"I feel fine, just fine."
"You see, Robin baby."
Now be a good little Boy Wonder and do just as I say.
"No, I will not submit to your treachery!"
"Trap Door, sweetie pie, you're needed."
"Wrap up Robin, my boys."
Ah!
"Very good, kiddies."
You're learning the business.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Now, is there anything I can do for you, Black Widow?"
"As a matter of fact, there is."
I have a perfectly devastating idea.
"Masked Muscles, you go back through the tunnel into my main web and have a little drink to the latest development."
"Ha, ha."
"- How does that grab you, doll?"
-Fine.
- Could we take Robin along too?
-But of course.
"No Robin, no Dynamic Duo."
- N'est-ce pas?
"- Ha, ha."
"Now, I imagine Robin is getting a bit heavy?"
"Boys, I'm sure the Bat-doll would like to get rid of him."
Better tie him up.
"Well, Bat-doll, perhaps you would like some champagne?"
I never touch spirits.
Have you some milk?
Milk?
"Oh, yes, yes."
"Oh, maybe Trap Door has some."
EZRA:
Hmm.
Perhaps I could be persuaded to act as your advocate.
You?
[LAUGHS]
You're the one who had me locked up.
I don't find your story compellingly truthful.
"Well, I don't care what you think."
I know I'm innocent.
"All right, suit yourself."
Holler if you change your mind.
[EZRA chuckling ]
The judge says one of us needs to represent my father.
I don't think it should be me.
-Chris?
-What?
"Hell, Nathan, you know Chris don't say more than three words in a day."
"My apologies, Nathan, but I have legal issues of my own to deal with."
"That's all right, Ezra."
I wasn't thinking about asking you.
"Well, what you need is an honest, well-spoken..."
... handsomemanforthisjob.
"Fine, I'll do it."
Ain't nobody gonna listen to a youngster.
"Buck, you see a pretty girl in that courtroom, you're gonna be:"
I was thinking about Vin.
I get too nervous in front of a crowd.
What about Josiah?
He studied Cherokee law.
-That should count for something.
-And he's got a suit.
Josiah.
Mom taught me.
Your mother was a great student.
She'd be...
I want to go back to the circus.
I want to go home.
Let's get Quico out of bed.
I'll take you to the beach.
"No, I want to go home."
Eat your bread.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Do you see anything?
I'mjust looking.
"Maria, when you're back in the circus someday, can you take me along?"
I want to see you walk the tightrope.
"Look, Marcia."
I made this for you.
It's beautiful.
It used to be my favorite toy.
"Whenever it rained hard, I set it in the water to watch it float down the gutter."
I stared as it floated away.
Take me to the circus.
What about your mother?
She can't tell me what to do anymore.
Going back still scares me.
Maybe it's best if I keep as a painter.
You're an artist.
You belong in the circus.
"Young man, I regret to inform you that this love will not last."
"How do you know, mom?"
Have you ever truly loved someone?
"Mom, dad!"
Anything I can do?
"No, thanks, Frank."
[GUNFIRE]
They'll be blasting it open pretty soon.
"Stacey, the riot's a bust."
Get back in your cell while there's still a chance.
"No, won't do me no good now, kid."
"I still got that Limpy rap hanging over me, even though it was-- [EXPLOSION]"
It wasn't my job.
I wouldn't appear against you.
I know it.
"It's no use, Frank."
This is the last roundup for Stacey.
[GUNSHOTS]
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.
It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?
Over there.
I wanna talk to him.
Didn't I tell ya I had a surprise for ya?
Come on.
I ain't got no time to waste.
"Funny, just an hour ago, I had 199 years."
And now I ain't got no time at all.
I'll get the rat.
[GUNSHOTS]
We got an affidavit from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.
What about those guys who framed me?
Did you get them?
Yeah.
"Well, rat."
So it caught up with you.
Ok I don't understand the deal about big dicks
I mean they just hurt.
I mean not that I've ever really experienced one.
Becca and Hallie are my two best girlfriends.
They're always game to listen to my problems and dispense useful commentary.
Toe suckers freak me out.
I heard that he photographed Charlize is that true?
I mean I love her she's like one of my favorite.
Top five for sure.
Maybe I'm just being jealous?
Ok how do you spell his last name?
Becca what are... tell me you're not looking him up on the internet?
I personally think your dog is your biggest issue in your dating life.
What?
"Question, where does Bowie sleep?"
He sleeps in my bed.
Ok but if a guy...
sleeps over where does Bowie go?
"Um, I guess he just stays in my bed."
Wait what about fleas?
More importantly what about sniffing?
Don't dogs sniff?
Bowie stop it.
Bowie...
"Ok, Ok you have a point."
Dating in general...
is difficult enough Dale.
Uh oh...
What?
Oh no...
Becca what?
Ok you know that German supermodel?
"I know it's rough, man."
"I get it, you know?"
"He's your best friend and all, and you miss him like hell."
"But know this, he will never apologize to you."
- And he will never say that you're right.
"- I appreciate the concern, George."
I really do.
It's funny.
I always thought you didn't like me.
"Point is, you gotta stay strong."
We can't enable.
We gotta wait until the right time to let a person like that back in our life.
[yelps] Oh!
Shit!
[mutters] Fuck.
[knocking on door]
- Hi!
"- Hey, man."
"What's up, man?"
"Come on in, I was about to put a pot of coffee--"
"Oh, buddy, are you all right?"
You look a little torn up.
Yeah.
First time I've been in town and just-- kind of a lot of feelings and--
"Like, a big hole's opened up."
"Yeah, I guess."
You want some tape or something for that?
"Oh, yeah."
"No, if by ""something"" you mean a clean pair of pants?"
- I didn't realize we were winking.
"- Yeah, dude, we're winking."
Oh!
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so..."
I thought that...
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from EST.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um... had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Ah.
"No, I didn't mean that."
It was supposed to be a gnome.
It looked more like a frog.
"When the teacher said, ""What's that, Julie?"" I said, ""Please, miss, it's a frog."""
I'm not usually so quick--thinking.
"She picked it up and said, ""It's a frog, is it?"""
"Then with a snooty expression she said, ""It looks like a gnome""!"
Yes.
"You lost me round about the second frog, Julie."
"No, what it is, I want you to model yourself."
I want you to be a model.
"Consider this while I unravel Gravel...er, Granville."
"About time, too."
"How would you feel about being Little Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982?"
"No, thank you."
I've only got out of me pinny.
I'm not putting a dress on!
"Not you, you clown!"
I'm talking to Julie.
"Little Miss Arkwright's Stores, 1982?"
A central figure in our advertising c--campaign.
-
- Really?
-
- Could somebody get me out of here!
Quiet!
You're very noisy since you left your vest off!
-
- Just get me out!
-
- It's like a loudspeaker in the shop!
"Look, thanks a lot."
That's what I get paid the big bucks for.
"Speaking of which, that will be two hundred of them."
"Right, remember?"
Yeah listen.
Alls I got is thirty right now.
"Hey, that's nice. 18 karat?"
"Forget it, sentimental value."
Sentiment has no value.
Sentiment has no value.
How about I give you this now and I'll give you the rest next week when I get paid.
"How about you give me the ring, or I'll dial 9-1-1."
"Take it, but if you call the cops, I'll find you and I'll fucking bury you."
You got it?
"Christ, get off me man."

"I'll marry you, Elise, you'll live in luxury!"
"You can even bring the child, if you want to."
You're a lucky girl.
"I was happy with my Henry, but then my luck flew away."
"Except for - look, they have the same eyes."
I'm sick of your comedy.
Keep your palace.
I don't want it.
And get out!
I'll stay true to Henry even though he's gone!
Impossible!
You must marry me!
Leave Elisa alone!
She's got to marry me!
She must marry me!
"So you won't let her be, you nasty wretch?"
We've had really enough of you.
We saw right through you!
Get out or I'll change you into a limping mare!
- You said you can't do it.
"- I know, but he doesn't."
Let's scare him out of his wits!
"Climb on my back, quick."
Don't drop me!
"Jean, it's me!"
The Duke!
"It's all her fault, and she's waiting for you!"
- Who?
- The old witch!
Our salvation!
But your Grace...
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Please.
"Hey, Jerry."
"George, you decided to get a rug."
"Good for you, Jack."
"Well, I'm just looking, really."
"Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment."
I'll be right with you.
"Listen, George, I got some bad news."
I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
- What?
- What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.
"And you know, you can't fight city hall."
"You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day."
- You didn't!
- I did.
And he told me that...
- I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.
How's your life?
All right?
"Yeah, not bad at all."
"And now, ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel."
"So, Jake, what's your percentage on this book?"
"Actually, I have some very interesting information on that."
"- You know, this is a co-venture..."
- Where did you get those?
- And as such it...
- Those glasses.
- Where did you get those glasses?
I'm not going anywhere.
You're too important ?
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone into position.
Who knows when they're gonna come back again?
Jake?
Go ahead.
So they got their reinforcements.
It's a couple hundred men.
And another six of those deuce and a halfs.
"They're mobilizing now, so I say you got about 15, maybe 20 minutes before they're on you."
"All right, you get back here as soon as you can."
All right?
"Say, what do you know about a set of train tracks running alongside the river?"
Why?
What do you see?
"Hawkins, what's on the tracks?"
I don't know.
I can't see.
Hawkins...
Robert...
"Robert, disconnect it."
Hang on.
"Jake, you got a very large train coming from New Bern and they've got three cargo cars."
What's in them?
"I think it's men, and there's hundreds of them."
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
"Hawkins, what's going on?"
Talk to me.
"Jake, I'm on my way."
I've got to go.
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-l'm stirring it.
"-Listen, you know what to do?"
"-Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois!"
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it!
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
I know what to do.
"Hey, you little hick, just make sure you do it!"
You're such a pain.
-Hey!
Just do it!
-Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.
So what does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
She calls from the house.
If anyone was listening they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd have the flight number.
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to watch on the stove.
All day long the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
For what?
"You moved on, started a family."
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.
"Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?"
But I'm here now.
It's too late for that.
"I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us."
(crickets chirping)
It's very late.
I didn't hear you come in.
"Well, I wanted to let you sleep."
It didn't go well with the men?
These guys saw hell.
"You know, most of them are still paying the price."
"You feel the effects of war, too, Booth."
Yeah.
"Yeah, but I got lucky."
I got a great family and great life.
Got all this.
"You're an addict, just like Aldo."
Yeah.
"Unlike him, you got help."
Yeah.
But you're in my corner.
That's the difference.
Aldo had no one.
(beeping)
Hey.
"I just, uh, dropped off Jessica."
"And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell."
Looks like it's rough going.
I thought those things actually worked.
In what way?
"Well, you know, she and I would get going, and, uh, you know, there was never any middle ground."
It just would always end up being an all-out war.
And it never accomplished anything.
"It would just end up leading... well, you know where it led."
You lost her.
Are you afraid that you might lose Erica?
I don't know.
I--I don't understand.
"I mean, I don't even know what that was in there."
I was not a good father.
"And I'm aware of that,"
But I am a good therapist.
"Yes, but even the best therapists miss things."
What?
"Just tell me, then."
What is the connection here?
"You know, why am I having the same fight with Erica"
That I used to have with my daughter?
Only one way to find out.
Stop it!
Sarah.
Let go of me!
Sarah!
"Forget it, dad, I'm never coming home!"
"Sarah, wait."
Wait!
I just wanna talk to you.
"Yeah, well, you never listen to me."
There's no point.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
"This time, I will listen."
Mostly.
"Are you two lazy bastards gonna get up and help, or what?"
So how do you know Will?
We volunteered together at Amnesty International a couple years ago.
"Yeah, that's right."
"How is the Burmese situation, Tom?"
Better?
I mean good?
"Yeah, and he called me up out of the blue for Christmas lunch."
"So, here I am."
Really?
"So, listen, what's the deal with you and Ellie now?"
Is she your girlfriend?
Are you insane?
Where did you get those trainers?
- Why?
What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.
What?
"By the way, I do think you and Rachel have a shot."
"- I mean, if you don't screw it up."
- Thank you.
I'd created a monster.
Or maybe he created me.
I don't know what Will was so upset about.
All I meant was I don't think couples are the future.
You need more than that.
You need backup.
"The way I saw it, Will and I both had backup now."
It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:
"""No man is an island."""
Subtitles by SOFTITLER
"- No, that was..."
"- I love ""Dawson's Creek."""
Listen to me.
I'm so happy.
And I think I just got worried that this part wouldn't work.
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen this in a while.
"Emma, I can't wait to see this."
"I know, but things are different, you know?"
They're a little wider and longer.
You think this isn't different?
"- Come on, man."
"- Look at this, look at this."
That wasn't there before.
That's something to grab onto.
Get your hands in there.
"Get a hold of that, see?"
"- All right, all right."
- How about this...
This mole here?
"That's new, that's interesting."
You should get that checked out.
"And, I'm sorry, check out these chicken legs, right?"
I'm just going straight chicken leg situations.
It's a two-piece meal.
"So yeah, it's different."
"But have you ever thought that it might be... much, much better?"

"Mags, mark and I did it!"
We did the sex!
"The truck is full, we'll have to do another round."
I'm coming.
- Let's go.
He's a private patient of Dr. Gertel.
"He started taking one more Fusid a month ago, he's had three attacks in the past year and he's allergic to penicillin."
- Alright.
"There's a list of his medications in his pocket, so take a look at it."
Okay.
The name's Ben-Shmuel?
"- Yes, Yitzhak."
"He was here before, gave me those candies..."
Licorice.
His pulse is down.
"- Okay, hurry up."
What's going on?
- Stay here.
"I'll come back later, Daddy."
It's okay.
I promise I'll come back.
Hey.
Are you moving in?
"It's a nice building, the neighbors downstairs are cool, so are the ones on the top floor."
"If you need anything, I live right here, just say the word."
What's your name?
Goni.
- I'm Sharon.
"Okay, bye, Goni."
- Bye.
"Life goes on, as the cliche goes."
There's a murder every 3 days and a robbery every hour
We'll arrive precisely on time
"Precisely, not approximately"
"No, I'm not going to force my opinion on you."
Because no one has the right to control another person.
"Hey, medicine seller."
How did today's wedding go?
"Come here, come here."
"Cat, cat."
Come this way.
"Come here, come here."
No one else has come out since you went in.
Hmm no.
(female announcer) Previously on Angela's Eyes...
Where's the box?
What box?
(Angela) The Anderson family time capsule.
"Oh, you mean that thing that we buried with Mom and Dad when we were kids?"
"I came here to, uh, to wish you a happy birthday."
"Great, you act like this is a birthday present."
This is our family time capsule.
"This is a clue, Ang."
"You know, I could never keep track of how many shirts were at the cleaner's."
Maybe you should check.
See if I left any there.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, my gosh."
Are you kidding me?
Angela got some papers from an old Korean cleaner.
They're in a bright red folder.
And I want them.
"What the hell are you doing, Dylan?"
Nothing.
"Cut the crap, dog."
"and half of you is man, and the other half is woman. (Chuckling)"
"Shame on you, how can you say such things to your elders?"
"Nevermind, come on, let's all have a drink."
Bastard!
I'll tear him to pieces!
"Hey, what are you saying?"
Let's not worry about those things when we have these two beautiful young ladies to enjoy ourselves with.
(laughing)
(banging)
I'm sleeping.
"Hey, what's wrong?"
"He's so cold to us, we've done nothing to him."
Didn't you see his pigtails?
He acts just like a woman!
(Laughing)
He is more like a woman than a man!
"Well, you're a man."
"So, does he love you?"
Shut your mouth!
"Come on, let's go."
"No wait, don't rush."
"No, I can't wait!"
"If you rush, then you're gonna spoil the mood."
What do you want?
I want you to come and undress me.
But not using your hands.
But how?
I can't wait!
Just how am I gonna do that?
"You idiot, you'd use your mouth."
Well?
Do you like that?
- I think it's strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
"A lesbian dream, and he's staring at me like I should include him."
I can't even fantasize in private.
Mom said you've been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
"It's almost April, and it's still cold."
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
"It'll sound strange, but..."
Is Claire happy?
"I mean, do you think she's happy?"
"Yes, I think she is."
Why?
I'm being silly.
"I'm a first-time husband, I guess."
"If she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic, I worry."
"Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we're married."
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don't do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
"You don't even know, do you?"
Let me make sure I understand.
You wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until you're done brushing.
What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?
"-Okay, okay."
Let me try again.
I don't wanna frost the cake while I'm still mixing the batter.
I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.
All right.
Here's what you do.
When you feel like the train is leaving the station... .
"You mean, going in the tunnel?"
"No, no, I mean leaving the station."
But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel.
"Okay, okay."
Let's start from the top.
"And work our way down, right?"
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.
"When you're making love, the way to slow yourself down is..."
... tothinkof something completely non-sexual.
"-Well, what do you think of?"
-You.
That was a really great dinner.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?
I've been ready since I was 1 4.
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.
I wanna hear what she has to say.
"Bloody Mary, shadows have power, I get it."
But what if that's not just a shadow?
That look on her face is somebody who's trapped.
"Believe me, I know that look and so do you."
"If things get hinky, you can pull the plug."
What do you got to lose?
I do need to do this.
"Wait, wait!"
Let me think!
Where are you?
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.
- No sign of any artifact.
- Not even a glimmer.
- What's up with his hand?
- I don't know.
"If you want to get rest, I'll stay with them."
- Not if they split up.
- I'll call you.
"No, no."
Let's...
Let's stay together.
"If they've got something, it's on 'em."
I want to know what it is.
I've been burned by this before.
They look real and they'll say anything.
Say something.
"Artie, when I get out of here, I'm hugging her and"
I'm kicking your ass.
"Yeah, well, that won't be happening."
Why?
"- Artie, it's me."
"So, um, so just out there."
Anybody could tell that old man wasn't...
You can't assume anything about anybody in a case like this.
That's the guy that's going to fuck you.
Damn right.
Shit.
"I been police chief here for, hell, going on, uh, six years."
I never even had to draw my gun.
"Good night, you."
Can you kiss your favorite mommy?
Get in the bed.
Get in there.
Get in the bed.
"See you in the morning, okay?"
"Good night, mommy."
Night.
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?
"Well, just about."
"That's your second bottle, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
I want to apologize about Dale's comment.
Bet John feels terrible.
Dale didn't mean anything by it.
He just grew up talking that way.
"Well, I understand, and I'm..."
I'm sure John does too.
"These people are pretty dangerous, aren't they?"
"Yes, ma'am, they are."
"You know, I've never seen Dale this excited before."
I guess this is about the biggest thing that's ever happened to him.
"This case, I mean."
We only went to dinner and then a movie.
"Harriet is not your daughter, Miss Golly."
"She is mine, and you have no idea, none, what it is like to come home and find"
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea that you'd be home this soon.
I don't care.
I don't care what you did or where you went or why.
All I know is this can never happen again.
Miss Golly... you are fired.
What?
!
No!
Just a moment.
This is my fault.
Please.
"Well, it seems awfully sudden."
Actually... maybe it's not.
"I think you're right, Mrs. Welsch."
It is time for me to go.
What?
What?
What?
"Now, look, I admit, I lost it... because, I just..."
I was frightened.
"But the thing is, the fact is we need you, Golly."
We can't do it alone.
"We all spoke out of turn, I think."
None of this is causing...
Absolutely not.
"Absolutely, no."
"I mean, I think we were talking about... our feelings out there."
"You were afraid and-and-and now what we should be focusing on, right?"
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
"Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys."
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaining about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kind of.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
Neutralise him and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned.
He can't finalise the arrangements without him.
- Who is he?
I need a name.
- When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
- You fucking prick.
- Shoot then.
Fuck.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Hi Maggie.
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
- I want to protect him.
- Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
He lectures alcoholics on television.
--Let's go.
--An totally normal jerk!
Pavel!
--Oh Lord!
--Bye
Poor man!
"Heart problems, Pavel Ivanovich?"
--Do you have a pen?
--Left it at work
"And garage keys, too."
Can we stop over and get those keys?
--My new bumper is there...
Bobylev...
"If we open up your brain, what will we find there?"
--Brains.
--A bumper!
"--One ball-point pen, please --Can you read, sir?"
It says we're on break from 14:00 to 15:00
It's 15:00 now
Can you hear the music?
"When it's over, that's when it's 15:00"
"Lady, there's 3.5 billion of us on this tiny planet"
We can reach out and touch each other with our hand.
But we live as if the entire universe separates us!
I am speaking to you from Venus and you cannot hear me on Mars
"And I shout over to you, lady, darling, sweetheart... please sell me that ball-point pen for 37 cents!"
I really need it.
My life depends on it.
And what?
How can one live this way?
What for?
Then I get to come too - it's in the rules.
Hit me.
"Your honour, there have now been two very similar murders and I think it's quite probable they were both committed by the same person."
We agree.
Hm?
"Oh, good."
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious the Crim did this too."
Let's charge him...
For murder!
Two time.
You have a good point.
How can he have a point?
Crim was in jail at the time of the murder?
You have a good point.
"Yeah, I have a good point."
How can Crim have done it?
"It's called shape shifting, your honour."
Something that's pretty darn easy to do.
"In fact, in the big city we do it all the time."
No they don't.
That's crazy.
"Yeah, look, I'm getting taller,"
I'm getting shorter.
"I'm getting taller, I'm getting shorter."
I'm getting shorter.
He's just standing on his toes.
I'm getting taller.
He's standing on his toes.
Ohhh...
"Counsellors, you have both made very compelling arguments."
He didn't.
So let me deliberate.
Find Mrs. Cole!
I need to talk to Mrs. Cole.
Mrs. Cole!
Has anyone seen Mrs. Cole?
- Come on before they find us.
- Where?
I don't know.
I never come to the studio.
Mrs. Cole!
The boss wants to try a take without Uncle Frank's lines 'cause he says we are losing visual tension.
"Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all."
- Nobody's had any sleep and you're just--
- It's all right.
I'm coming.
No.
Let me deal with it.
"Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself."
"Careful of big boy,"
- it's got a bit of a wobble on it.
Don't-
- Don't lean against it.
- Whoa!
Nobody move!
- Buckley!
"Nobody move, stay exactly where you are until we have some lights in here."
Stay where you are.
Back.
"Back, please."
Everybody get back.
Please take the girls away from the stage.
"Mr. Brown, please take them away."
Almost dawn.
Surely Lola was a good agent for the Ministry.
She made the Germans fall into her trap.
"Well, yes."
"We saved the Ministry, the door, and the damn history."
This is ready.
"Well, destroy it."
We'll take the prisoners to their car.
"No, wait."
We have to capture this moment.
"You, on the floor."
Take this.
Do you think I'm not going to impress my children with my picture of Himmler?
To see the face of a losing German... what a pleasure.
"Get used to it, with Luis Aragonés you'll learn all about it."
"¿Luis Aragonés is another Grandee of Spain, like Espínola?"
"Oh yeah, he's one of the great ones."

-I don't care.

I know that too.

(ENGINE STARTING)
BILLY:
"Hey, I would give you every dime we talked about, if I had the money."
The problem is I just don't have it.
Your partner here is starting to make me nervous.
"Why don't you sit your narrow ass down, ponytail?"
"Look, I know you guys are on the run."
And you need everything you can get.
"It's better than nothing, right?"
Let's lighten up.
"Look, this town is hot, and so are you, brother."
You fucked up.
You're on every goddamn channel.
You got no one else out there you can trust but me.
And I'm gonna let you walk with one.
What I'm telling you is take it or leave it... (GROANING)
Fucker.
Eight fucking dollars.
Liar!
Ugh!
(EMPTY CLICKING)
"Hey, wait a minute, he's got to have more money than that."
The movie director?
Yeah.
Shooting a film over on 1.
"""Gladiators."""
It's gonna make a billion in China.
"Oh, h-hold on."
You don't think that Austin had something to do with Phil's murder?
Was Austin filming last night?
He was supposed to.
"But for some reason, he shut down production early and took off."
About what time did he leave the lot?
I heard around 11:00.
Why?
Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.
Where do we find Stage 1?
You work out?
[Bell ringing]
Hayley:
"Oh, look."
There's Austin.
"So, how do you want to play this?"
"Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris, he's bound to be on guard, so we can't let him know that we are looking at him as a suspect."
Kendall?
!
"Oh, she's good. [Chuckles]"
How did she get onto Austin so quick?
We're done for.
"She's already got him wrapped around her skinny, little finger."
Don't say I never did anything for you.
"There you are, darling."
Mm.
"So, who's our new friend?"
"All of sudden she.said, ""Excuse me'"
"I said, yes please?"
"She said, ""My watch isn't working."
"Could you tell me the time?"""
I know.
This is an outdated idea to start a conversation.
Quite possible her watch must have stopped working.
You are unnecessarily suspecting her.
- No need to advocate for her.
What happened next?
- What else?
I told her the time.
Again there was a silence.
There was no sign ofthe bus.
I decided to walk. I had just put a step ahead and she said...
"""Listen""."
"-l said, yes, tell me."
"She said, ""You are leaving me alone over here"""
"""l am scared to be alone."
"Can you drop me home?"""
Why?
Was the bus-stop in a forest?
-Not exactly.
But she was afraid.
I told her to come along.
Then we started walking.
I felt like the poor thing was a bit tired.
"You know there are benches on the footpath, don't you?"
I told her to sit down for a few moments.
She sat down.
Then I saw that she was staring at me.
I asked Meena whatthe matter was.
Because I am the man.
And that's the man's job.
Good news.
You may unbuckle your safety belt and move freely about the house.
Tyler is leaving.
What?
"Oh, thank God!"
Where's he going?
He and Clem are driving down to Tijuana.
What?
No!
No!
No!
- They are not!
"- Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine."
I gave them a whole bunch of cash and my dusty wallet condom.
And the mother bear's off to protect her cub.
"Tijuana, here we come."
(car engine starts)
- Oh!
- Oh!
Get out of the car.
You are not going to Tijuana.
You listen to me.
"Tijuana is a low-down dirty place where anything goes, which is why I love it."
But you cannot go because you are still a child.
So are you.
I think we can agree my childhood ended with that text.
"Okay, you know what?"
Listen.
I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.
And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.
Because of his son?
Greg had a fling with Hillie.
A fling?
It seemed like he loved her.
"He loves a lot of the girls, but he's not gonna get serious with someone like Hillie."
His father would kill him.
"Stephanie, would you keep this to yourself for the moment?"
Of course.
Thanks.
- The blue one.
- What?
That's the dress you should bury her in.
The blue one with the bow.
"[ Al ] It's right here, Sam."
It's in the closet.
How long have you been there?
"Uh, well, long enough to know that you think Greg's old man murdered Hilla."
Or maybe Greg.
I thought the kid was in love with her.
"According to her diary, she met someone new."
She broke it off with Greg on the Fourth ofJuly.
"Well, maybe they made up again."
I don't know.
"After the fourth, there are no new entries."
Except she did put this in there.
What is it?
A blood test result.
Her beta H.C.G. was positive.
Uh-huh.
"Speak English, will ya?"
"Two people died in that lake, Al."
Hilla was pregnant.
Maybe not.
"When I went back to search rebecca's place,"
I found this between the couch pillows.
Rebecca shot herself.
I think so.
"She lost a lot today Her fiancee,her life savings."
Her respect.
Could have been a failed suicide attempt.
Or a bid f sympathy.
Or an attemptto escape discovery that she had sex with finn the day she died.
"What's your gut tell you,boss?"
Take your shirt off.
Here we go.
I know it's kind of messy.
"Thshirt,mcgee,take it off now."
Take it down to abby.
Or would you rather wait for a search warrant?
Rebecca's dna.
I need to borrow one of your shirts.
You afraid all that white might burn out abby's corneas?
Do not make me walk around like this all day.
Come on.Help me out.
All right.
I can't resist a damsel in distress.
****************************
"Wow,it's just like chippende'S... without the bow ties or muscles."
Givee a second.
I just have to finish this e-mail to kofi annan.
Kofi can wait.
"What is it,jethro?"
The finn case.
Yes?
No more mummy wife from now on.
Your eyebrows are going to be attached to here soon.
Then you'll be a monster.
"I'm warning you, this is really the end."
I feel like death.
"When you're sleeping next to a mummy, you yourself feel like you're dead."
Do you know how scary it is to see a mummy moving around at night?
Do you have nothing else to talk about?
I'm only saying it because it's us three.
Why are you still wearing that?
Is there still some bruising?
People will find out.
Stop it.
And the kids?
"They're here, they wanted to take a look at some things."
My husband's almost here as well.
The guest has arrived.
I'm not late.
I'm five minutes early.
I just got here as well.
Hello.
Hello.
Take that off.
"Right, shall I?"
Why is it so hot?
I'll be taking this off.
Sure.
She's got a sty in her eye.
She didn't want you to see it so she got surgery.
Oh...
This color!
"Oppa, pretty, right?"
- I need your help.
- Oh.
You're not gonna handle this one on your own?
"You just couldn't help yourself, could you?"
"Sadly, no."
"Take Doug back to the loft, lock him down tight."
"- You can handle that, right?"
- Have I ever let you down?
"- Be careful, Fi."
"- Don't worry, Michael."
I never let my guard down.
What the hell do you mean you can't get ahold of her?
She doesn't have some kind of-
Yeah?
All right.
"Well, keep trying."
"Mike, she's in some kind of a meeting with a new client that just called this morning."
"I mean, it might be nothin'."
"It's not gonna be nothin', Sam."
- Hello.
"- Michael, if I had known... you were this much fun to work with..."
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'm glad one of us is having fun.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress, are you?"
"Michael, my son."
I'm afraid.
"Please, Michael."
Please.
- You changed.
- This is more my style.
"Oh, for crying out loud."
I'm not gonna shoot you here.
Like being so co-dependent you flunk your test.
You are like a detective.
I'm close to identifying the bad guy.
You already know half my life story.
Some of your questions even my mom has never asked.
Are you saying I'm nosy?
No.
"Why would I say that, doc?"
"You should get more sleep, doc."
How do you know I didn't?
I am an expert on this.
"Just looking at your eyes, I can tell."
"Lately, I have exams."
I recommend Redbull mixed with coffee.
You can stay awake until dawn.
And that's good?
It's okay.
It's not like we're 20 anymore.
"Back then, staying up 2 nights was nothing."
"But in our 30's, our body starts breaking down."
How long can you stay awake?
5 days.
Like the X-men.
It's my special power.
But I'm okay.
I feel totally fine.
"I can do it, doc."
It's... necessary.
I think you should stop.
"This is my profession, how can I stop?"
"If you can't stop, can you do less?"
I can't.
No chicks.
"Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!"
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
Last time you said it was polio.
"Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid."
"Hey, look, Claire's here."
"Oh, she's so fine."
"Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?"
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
"Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High."
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
"Well, that's something."
What's her name?
- I don't know.
Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!
"Oh, fuck it."
I'm gonna go talk to Claire.
"- No, you're not."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Watch me.
I will not die a virgin.
Ow!
My dick!
"Goddamn it, Maureen."
Don't sit like that.
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
"Now you listen, and you listen good."
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
"It's me, Cosmo."
"All right, so it's me."
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
"- I can't sleep, I tell you."
I can't sleep.
"- Of course you can't, you poor sap."
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
"- Help me, Kramer."
Help me.
"- All right, I'm gonna help you."
"I'll try some on, we'll see how they look."
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phoney mat coming down on top of it.
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- It's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
Molly bowen Please go to your room and pack your things.
Miss fry...
Please.
"I hope you had a splendid evening,"
Because it will be your last at the griffith.
Let her be an example for the rest of you.
This institution is not unlike fort knox or alcatraz.
"Whether by force or trickery, this building is impenetrable."
Can you believe that?
"I don't, actually."
No building is impenetrable.
"Ladies and gentlemen, our pal leet brannis."
Coroner says the amalgam in his teeth is russian.
Yeah?
How did he get the scar?
His voice box was cut out.
Mm.
Probably happened during the war.
Russian rifle division...
the 478th.
"Now, you ready to have your socks knocked off?"
Leet brannis died.
"I know that, son."
I'm staring at his corpse.
Two years ago.
Guy I knew in basic ended up in the u.S. Embassy in moscow.
I had him dig into the 478th.
"Turns out, they were wiped out in '44"
"In the battle of finow, germany."
Dead don't walk.
"At least, not in my experience."
Where we at with your guy?
I remember that.
This was one of the craziest days of my life.
- I don't know if you guys recall.
"- Yeah, I remember that."
Yeah.
"You guys were shooting without me, so I had..."
I was...
"- Oh, this was the day."
- That's a great story.
"- Yeah, but there's not enough time."
- It'll take all day to tell.
- Michael had a crazy adventure.
"- I did, yeah."
Because I thought I was coming in to work at 6.
That's what I was told.
And then I didn't end up coming until 2.
"And anyway, there's too much to say."
Too much.
But Devendra Banhart is in this scene.
- Right.
That was cool.
- Later on.
"And your friend Kevin, right?"
Kevin and Devendra Banhart are in the scene we're about to see.
And...
- Kevin visited a bunch of times.
- This is a sweet scene.
"- This is the handholding scene, right?"
- Yeah.
I remember Aaron and I were talking about...
He was really nervous before shooting this scene because this was his audition scene.
And I had said my import authority...
There may be some tools we can use.
"Okay, I'll try to reach it."
"There'll be a phone line as well, I heard the main house."
"Probably a burglar alarm too, so we need to... we need to get the police here if we can Okay, how're you doing?"
You okay?
"Better than you, babe."
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
You think Chris could have sent the postcard?
I don't know.
Maybe.
"But really, I-I-I don't know."
"Can I count on you, Luke?"
Of course.
Might get a little hairy.
I don't want you getting any ideas.
Absolutely not.
I just wanna get through this.
We all do.
Good man.
Luke.
"None of us sent the card, Justin."
Seriously... this hasn't gone too far.
"You can just set us free, walk away."
No one will talk.
You have my word.
Here's the deal...
Someone owns up to sending the postcard
- I let you all go.
- And if no one owns up?
"- Well then, we play Truth or Dare."
"- You're full of shit, man."
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom.
To get some aspirin... and I happened.
To look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... }where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
Denver 9.
99 they will die.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
"Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine."
"If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole."
"That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit."
Get off my beach!
"Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you."
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
"- The only ""butt"" I wanna see is yours... walking away."
"Come on, son."
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
"Now, where was I?"
- Right here.
"- Oh, yeah."
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
"I don't know, but it sure is ugly."
ERIK:
"No, Pa."
This is so unfair.
[SINGING] After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
BRYAN:
- Brandon Mayhew.
- Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
- I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man!"
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Ok.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
And a felony quantity.
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
"The cops around here are like butchers, always got their thumbs on the scales."
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm going to get you a second phone call.
"You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader, and they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650."
I'll write that down on the back of my business card.
4-6-5-0.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
"Oh, no."
"""Kanima."""
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl with severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of Argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
-Yes!
-Why?
Because...
He's evil.
-You just don't like him.
-The guy bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-adrian:
It hurts when I breathe.
"Okay, Judy, I think you've broken your breastbone."
"Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis."
What else can you tell us about the vehicle?
There was a bike rack on the roof.
They tried to force me off the road.
They wanted to steal my car.
Am I bleeding?
You hit the window.
It's not bad.
Will I need stitches?
"Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am?"
I don't know.
It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there.
Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.
We need to let her rest before she goes up to the CT.
- We're working here.
"- Sorry, Luka."
We've got a trauma.
We need the room.
"All right, here we go, gently."
Lift up the neck.
"On my count, one, two, three."
Here we go.
We're out of infant C-collars.
Luka do you know if we have any infant C-collars?
You can use towel rolls.
Airway is patent.
I can't hear breath sounds with all the crying.
- Do we have a sat?
A few.
Through my dad.
"Look, I spend half my life trying to get people like Cleaver Greene to pay their tax."
How do you think that makes me feel?
This is a chance for me to do some good.
So do it.
Knock 'em dead.
I have to go study.
TV:
"Then let it go, and crouch, and hold."
CLEAVER:
"Morning, folks."
Stretch out the whole body and...
Pica hardly sleeps here.
Just comes to paint and read.
I've no idea what he does with the rest of his time.
"I shouldn't let him stay, really, but he's quiet and he's a gentleman."
"There you go, my lad."
"Come on, boys, out of there."
Finnegan.
She is your teacher!
She's meant to be telling you about Jane Austen.
It is age inappropriate sex!
It's bloody great sex.
"At your age, you should be having exploratory sex with a girl your own age."
And maybe some oral.
"Oh, yuck."
"The damage you are doing to your psyche could be irreparable, darling."
I know.
I'm trained.
"Well, I'm not ending it."
It is immoral!
Is everything okay?
"Pete, it's over."
We won.
Wait.
W-What does...
What does that mean?
Lance offered me the cash.
Oh.
Great.
You bet your ass it's great.
"Our con was so good, we got paid in phase 1."
Not bad for first timers.
"Uh, yeah."
We're naturals.
"I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good."
Hold on.
Hold on.
W...
"What do you mean, Lance won?"
It's called a Jesus con.
We never talked about this?
"A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior."
A con man's not always after money.
Julia will think he's the hero.
She'll never believe my side.
"But the important thing is you got the money, so..."
What if I turn it down?
Why would you turn it down?
If I do... can we still con him?
"Grandma, let's just think about this for a second."
- A bird in the hand is worth...
- No.
"Is this May, 2016?"
Yeah.
You're exactly where you said you'd be.
Do not get on that ship.
"If you do, you're all dead."
Says who?
"Says you, Mr. Rory."
You sent me.
I'm sorry.
Who exactly are you?
My name is Rex Tyler.
I'm a member of the Justice Society of America.
You were huckin' the ball around with your pals the other day...
"Say, uh..."
"What's the deal with your sweetie there, Squirrely Dan?"
"Well, I took her out last night."
- Where to?
- Outs to the chip truck.
- Fries and gravy?
- I had mine with gravy.
She had hers with salts and malts vinegar.
Do you know that salt and malt vinegar's a non-traditional way to dress your French fries in the United States?
What the fuck is wrong with them?
Like malt vinegar is not a staple condiment on tabletops in restaurants in the United States.
"Fuck, figure it out."
That's what I say.
"I say, figure it out."
"Got no vinegars on the tables, no Krafts peanut butters."
- WAYNE:
Figure it out.
- DARYL:
Whoever took that wallet was about the most stupid sneak thief in the world.
Why do you say that?
Because the risks are to great and the reward is too small.
"I always say that if you're going to steal at all, steal in a way that will be admired."
"Let's get out of here, hm?"
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
I know the perfect place.
First time I've ever been in a subway.
What a fascinating experience.
Everybody who comes here wants to ride in the subway.
You'll get over it.
"Say, what about those abc's you were telling me about?"
We'll get to that.
This is where I live.
What kind of a district is this?
See for yourself.
You know Park Avenue is only three blocks away?
But I'll never make it.
"You know, I think I'm gonna like you."
You won't tire my mind.
I might wear it out my way.
Go on in.
It's safe.
Thanks.
Fix yourself a drink.
Fix me one too.
What'll you have?
Bourbon.
How?
Straight.
Okay.
The first days are different from now.
Serving tea to your husband is work now?
is it the same?
"Yes, but it's not work."
"Whether you make tea or serve it, it's work."
"I serve you tea, it does you good."
But no one takes care of me to help me relax.
I know you're exhausted.
Serving tea is work these days.
Don't take any photos.
I have three jobs.
"I have three jobs, not you."
And the third is the hardest and most important.
Don't take any photos!
- l should have kept it.
- l'll put it away.
- l said no photos.
- All right.
I won't do it again.
Don't men have a third job?
Only women?
We don't?
"If men don't do their third job, they'll be dishonoured."
Their third job weighs as heavily as a mountain.
It's a very hard job to do.
It's not as simple as you think.
is that wrong?
- Mashti Hatam!
- What?
"Come on, come on."
The engineer's forgotten his camera again.
He's as distracted as me.
You're a good man?
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.
"That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking."
"Okay, I'm..."
I'm a good man.
"And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you."
"Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner."
"Trust me, I was reining it in."
He's seizing.
Darren?
I need suction and an airway now.
Your incision is healing well.
"Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry."
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Yes.
Um... you should probably get some light exercise.
Just go walk around the block or something.
"You know, just get out."
Wow.
"Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's."
"You were in the closet, Violet."
"Look, I'm..."
I'm doing the best I can.
"No, I know you are."
I do.
"Oh, look at that smile."
That's gas.
Sorry to tell you.
"No, it is not gas."
"I wanted a Searider, but my uncle wouldn't pop for it."
Your uncle like boats?
Who?
Paulie?
Paulie wouldn't know a cleaver from a fucking cleat.
"It was my dream, you know."
Free of the goombahs.
Run a charter in the islands.
Eddie was going to help me.
You and Eddie?
That's a strange marriage.
He was only going to find clients.
I'll tell you something.
"If I'd met him earlier, I'd never be in this mess."
If only Tino hadn't whacked Eddie.
Know why he was there that morning?
Santos wasn't there to take Tino down.
He was there to get information on the judge.
How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $ 10,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks."
I got my own Witness Protection Program.
Morning.
The sharks are already circling.
Another Zapatti washed up.
They fished him out of the 79th Street Basin.
- Bye.
Seven and I work at a production company
That cranks crappy reality shows.
Our job is to find and cast
"The quote, unquote talent."
Such as it is.
So just be natural and forget that the camera's even here.
Well I'm very comfortable in front of a camera.
So why don't you tell me how you and Burt met?
I'm sure that's a great story.
We met on the internet.
Now take these two.
"There here for a spot on the upcoming show ""Geezer Town."""
Some people will say or do just about anything to be on TV.
A blue pill a day makes your lady want to stay.
Oh yeah!
Hey Dale
Ohhh...
Seven
There's a call for you on line two.
Oh.
Really?
Um...
I will be back in just a second.
This is Dale Squire.
It's Becca
Can you come pick me up please?
"Yeah, what's wrong?"
"I'm on Doheny and Sunset, make a left."
"Ok, I'll be there in two seconds."
You don't want to leave this in there.
"That was Becca, she was crying."
And the pig's tongue is for you only.
I wanted to fool you!
"I want to take your advantage, so what?"
I won't give it a damn to tell you the truth.
"It's hot, and life is boring,"
"I just want to have fun, isn't it alright?"
That's alright!
"Well, it's OK then."
Why do you stare at me?
"Because of our friendship,"
I'll let you kiss something anyways.
You'd better ask her.
Excuse me.
"Chan Mon-gut, you are a married man, why do you still date me for dinner?"
You'll make me misunderstand something.
Haven't you thought of my feeling?
A smart guy isn't a big shot.
Miss Shiu.
Very simple!
She secretly admires him.
He fooled him.
He wants to kiss her.
You are mad at him.
"I wanna beat you, you know?"
Siu-tso!
Lend it to me.
Miss Shui...
Please wait!
"Miss Shui, it's dark outside, let me show you the way home."
"No, you'd better lend me the lantern."
I'll return it next time.
Next time?
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
"Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that."
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for the drive."
I had a great time.
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
You're welcome.
"Hey, listen, listen!"
"If anybody asks you, we was out smashing' mailboxes, OK?"
Wha... what?
"Oh, man, the paint's still wet!"
"No, no, no, no!"
Get out of the store!
Hey!
Don't eat the radial!
"Here, take-a the snow tires."
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?
"- Whoa, boy!"
- Hey!
"Hey, guys!"
There's one goin' this way.
I got it.
"Come here, little tractor, come here."
"Yeah, that's a good tractor."
"No, no, no, no, come here."
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to go wandering off all alone.
What are you doin' with those old racing' tires?
"Come on, Doc, drive."
And now she's in the wind.
Kiddo.
Listen.
Go back to those twins.
They're your family now.
This was a bad idea.
So...
You.
Here.
This is what?
You giving up on working with your son?
Duval doesn't care what I think about this case or anything else.
You can't really believe that.
Your son wants very badly to please you.
Why do you think he became an FBI agent?
You don't follow in the footsteps of someone whose opinion doesn't matter.
You matter to him.
I never thought of that before.
He got into law enforcement because of me.
He wanted to please me. [Chuckles]
"His whole life, he just wanted to please me."
If he's her and I'm him...
Why am I here?
Because you want me to shut up.
Okay.
I'm good with that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You want me to shut up.
You really want me to shut up.
And yet you still keep on talking.
Not now.
"I mean, probably now, but even when I was dead, did you ever hear me then?"
- Me!
You're about to see a trick by Foguinho the Magnificent.
Wait right there.
This is a very special box.
It came from a very serious land.
- Do you see anything inside?
- No.
"It is a magic box, you see?"
When I go like this-
A rose for the pretty girl!
"Can we get some applause, kindly?"
You'll share this room with Quico for now.
"This is all yours, my darling."
Do you like the room?
It's really high.
"Put your things away, darling."
What is the matter?
There's a whole closet just for you!
We're used to it Mrs. Maria Cecília.
"At the circus, we don't get a lot of room."
"It doesn't matter, my love."
We'll get you settled in later.
There's no rush.
Enjoy the party.
"There are so many kids here, and so many sweet treats."
Go on over to the living room.
"Go play with Foguinho and the kids, sweetie."
Barbuda will be right there.
She's so quiet.
She's been lately always thinking...
- Thinking about what?
- Like I'd know!
-l hate that it had to turn out this way.
-(siren wailing)
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
-England?
-Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
-How long?
-Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1-7.
6-9-0-1-0.
katherine:
That's enough!
You've already said that over 30 times today.
Dinner is served!
What family education!
Grabbing the bigger piece.
How were you taught?
Always to take the smaller piece!
You got what your mother told you to get!
Couldn't find the Formula.
But I found this.
"On April 14, 7:00 p.m., the Emperor's godson, Hiroshima Tora,"
The Emperor's godson!
Will pick up the 'Beast' posing as Special Envoy from Chungking.
You want to know what he looks like?
Looks just like you!
What a coincidence!
You know what to do then?
You want me to pose as him?
Right!
What if the real thing turns up?
- He wouldn't.
- How come?
"Tomorrow, we'll get on the train 1 station ahead... ls it the right person?"
Why don't you ask himself?
Are you Hiroshima Tora?
People with hearing aids are usually deaf.
"From my past experience, he doesn't look the part."
Let's go to the other cabin.
It's him!
"Kidoo, get a bigger hammer!"
We haven't worked so well together for ages.
Who's he?
- I have you.
- What?
!
What do you have?
You have what I have...
nothing!
"You, my boy, were in Mom and Dad's bed."
"Oh, ho-ho-ho."
"What was that, the sound of power suddenly shifting?"
Nothing happened.
"Yeah, and it didn't happen in Mom and Dad's bed."
I have you.
I have you by your ovaries.
"Hey, Cor, buddy, I'm not gonna kill you."
That was one of those wacky brother-to-brother murder threats.
Yeah.
"Listen, I'd like you to do something for me."
- Anything you need.
- Tell me how you do it.
What I was doing with Rebecca?
"No, no, what you were doing with Rebecca, I don't have the lung capacity for that."
"I just wanna know, how do you get a girl to say hi?"
"- Oh, you're wasting my time."
- I have you.
"Now, ordinarily I wouldn't reveal my foolproof method, but I know I can count on my favorite little brother to keep a secret."
I'm listening.
"- OK, you got eyes?"
- Yeah.
- Use 'em.
- How?
Look at her.
Look into her.
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
Ew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, it's-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
Everything's the same as when Golly was here.
It looks the same... it smells the same... but there's this tiny hole inside me that wasn't there before.
It's like... like a splinter in your finger... only this one's right above my stomach.
"Harriet, are you okay?"
Uh-huh.
Something's... different.
No cats?
How can Harrison Withers not have a billion cats around?
They finally nailed him.
I will always remember that face.
That's the face you make when you really lose something.
"Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck."
Speak English!
"Oh, okay, you want us to speak English, huh?"
!
"Well, you are a jerk, huh?"
"I tell you, ""Don't take the truck."
"You smash the truck."""
"Well, you tell me now,"
"Mr. Wise Guy, was one date worth it?"
...we have people here shopping!
Yeah.
"Hey, all right, Grandpa."
"It's cool, right?"
"It wasn't a big deal, huh?"
"I knew you'd understand, right?"
Sometimes I think families everywhere are exactly the same.
Everybody get back to work.
"Mom, Dad, please?"
Grandpa!
Just calm down.
Too exciting.
# Now I'll run from you #
# This tainted love you've given #
# I give you all a girl could give you #
# Take my tears and that's not nearly #
# Oh... tainted love #
# Tainted love #
"# Don't touch me,please #"
# I cannot stand the way you tease #
"# I love you,though you hurt me so #"
# Now it's time you pack your things and go #
# Tainted love. #
"The guy sings a five-minute song about what I bitch I am, and then kisses me and walks away."
I should not be turned on right now.
I can't believe he walked away.
"I mean,who does that?"
"And what,has he been locked away at T Hot Rocker Academy of Kissing for the past five years?"
"Hey,Bella."
What?
Where's my car?
Hello!
"Obvious sign,girl."
What the hell?
- You were driving.
- Exactly.
I was busy.
"Dude,I'm gonna blame you."
It's my option.
Are you serious?
"I'm not paying this time,just so you know..."
"Hi,Marty."
"Um,so,my sister is an ass."
"And,uh,we're gonna need a ride."
And a piece of macaroni omeIet.
In case you get hungry...
Am I leaving on a trip?
- You have a tape worm.
- When I was a kid!
"Besides, if it eats the omelet, the ham and the bread, it's no little tape worm, it's a tape python!"
"Morning, Mrs. VoIpe."
- You're still here?
- AfuII employee.
She has to go!
"I understand, but why do I need this?"
"If you lose it, we'II replace it."
"Don't waste time, there's a line forming."
Want to be here till nightfall?
"I'm talking to a client, I can't do him Iickety split."
Take the toothpick out of yourmouth.
I need it so I don't stammer.
"I'II handle this man, you continue with the others."
- Mr.?
- Scapece.
What can we do foryou?
I'd Iike to apply for a Postamat.
Afriend?
Afriend of his came here and got a Postamat.
This friend gets his retirement pay accredited to his account so he can easily withdraw cash.
Without sweating blood.
Do you understand?
could you repeat that?
I got it!
Third window.
Come in.
- What is it?
Yes.
Don't you think you should be at home?
With your husband?
"Darling, I wanna go home with you."
But I can't until I know the results of those tests.
"Alexis, I don't understand it."
"I mean, what are you doing?"
"Are you still choosing between me and Galen, with me in second position?"
"No, Dex."
I love you.
"Oh, God, we went through hell to rescue Galen."
Can't you understand?
Can't you try and support me like a husband should?
I find it hard supporting my wife's apparent love for another man.
Wrong tense.
I loved him once.
But I'm frightened for him now.
"Mrs. Dexter, King Galen is asking for you."
Thank you.
"And I'm frightened for us, Alexis."
I'll see you later.
"Hello, Galen."
- Alexis.
- Mm.
I was so afraid.
But not for my life.
I thought I might not ever see you again.
No.
"Here I am, larger than life."
And you're safe now.
"Your life is safe here, Galen."
"This cursed revolution, if it hadn't happened, I would never have let you leave Moldavia."
"Nora, Johnny, you need anything..."
"Gary, Gary, get a plate."
You just dropped mustard on my half-dead ex-husband.
How you holding up?
"Surreal, man."
"All the patients we brought here, it's never personal."
This is...
I don't know.
"Hey, Mac said you can take the day off tomorrow."
Take as much time as you need.
"Oh, no."
I'm working.
"I sit here all day, I'll go crazy."
I came as soon as I could.
- What'd the doctor say?
- Could go either way.
"All right, so we got options."
"Okay, everybody, I'm selling squares 10 bucks a pop."
We're also doing pool bets...
Over/under's at three days.
- Mom...
- Over/under for what?
If he lives?
Either way pays.
I thought Johnny's parents were divorced.
They are.
There's no way an Irish woman would miss a good death.
Mom and Dad have a complicated relationship.
It's not complicated.
I hate him.
"But if my coma bets pay off, I'll love him."
"Frank, whatever you're gonna do, do it on Wednesday."
"-You know, I should probably go."
"-Oh, come on, Golan."
How often do you get a night and a morning off?
-I'd stay for another.
-Okay.
--and the emotional response to love  is usually the result of a show of affection or favour.
"-Tom, can I use your phone?"
"-Yeah, it's right over there."
-I think we'd do really well together.
-Absolutely.
For a while.
"God, will you get past the cynicism?"
"I just broke up with somebody, baby."
I thought you forgot all about him.
Hello?
Al?
-Who are you with?
-Just some of the residents.
"I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving, and I don't want to be rude."
You want to come down?
No.
I'll see you when you get home.
All right.
You're ageist.
-That's what it is.
"-Oh, please."
Then what are you afraid of?
Breaking your heart.
"Running your ass into the ground, buddy."
Bollocks.
Why do you want to ruin this with domesticity?
"Because I've never met a braver woman and I'm deeply, deeply attached to you."
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know."""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
- What's your point?
- You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"- That's my job, isn't it?"
- That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just...
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
Most of all friends.
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
"A man's life is not the bricks, it's the mortar."
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff...
!
"Health and Safety, rummaging through me stock!"
"All right, they found a little few things."
Couple of mice.
"So what's, what's the...?"
Few rat droppings in the lemon bonbons.
Couple of fruit salads was way past their sell-by date.
Three years.
"That's not a crime, though, is it?"
"Well, enough to get you shut down."
Is it enough for you to kidnap him?
That's what I want to know.
I'll tell you what I know - he don't know nothing about sweets.
And I've got sweets running through my veins!
I know that.
Look at me!
I know that.
"I'm on my own, I've got nothing!"
Open up.
"There you go, it's all right."
It's all right.
"Plenty of other, there's plenty of other sweet shops out there."
Could I have a bit of the strawberry laces?
There you go.
"I had everything, now I've got nothing!"
"There you go, eh?"
Time was of the essence.
We headed to the station.
For clues?
No.
For something a little more important than that.
"Come on, O'Leary, follow me."
I don't see anything that I would consider to be art.
But you took the picture.
Just because ducky told me to.
- I'm sorry.
- That'okay.
I'm sure you find other things beautiful.
Like gibbs breaking up a chick fight.
I can't believe I missed that.
"Well,I've got good news."
Guess at is now playing on mcgee tv.
I hug and kiss technology.
You liar!
mee-yow.
Which one's siri?
The one that gibbs is pulling off e other girl.
It's always good to have a face to put with genetic material.
You get a match on h off finn's clothing?
Yeah.
But not just her.
There was a party in finn's pants.
I found genetic material from two distinct females.
- Siri and...
- A mystery woman.
That would explain why rebecca refused thcheek swab.
Told us she hadn't seen him in six months.
Play iagain.
"Plus,rebecca's got a lot of anger in her."
"Oh,I wouldn't assume siri is innocent."
Why not?
Look at the fight.
Siri initiates it.
She may not be as sweet as she looks.
Right?
"You heard it too, right?"
You think I'm deaf?
But why did you say you didn't hear?
What point is there in me fanning the flames?
You could see the team manager's eyelashes trembling.
"It's possible she could've mistaken herself for a moment, but why did she have to get angry?"
That's the first time I've seen the team manager act like that.
I was so shocked.
"Yeah, it was a bit unexpected."
Oh yeah.
I got an email asking me to call.
Let me have the phone.
"All right, I'll send it to you by phone."
It's not coming out well.
You're so sensitive.
"That's right, I'm sensitive."
Who is it?
The person who unexpectedly got angry.
Oh no...
You heard?
You think I'm deaf?
We weren't talking behind your back.
"Yes, you were."
"Yeah, Oppa?"
Are you okay?
Of course.
Did you eat lunch?
I just ate some noodles and am getting back to work.
"You're really okay, right?"
Has he called you?
He hasn't called since the day before yesterday.

GUARD:
Campus security.
Dr Penzler?
We had a report of a gunshot.
Hands up.
Get your hands up.
"Yeah, you keep 'em up there."
Okay.
Here's the situation.
"I'm holding these people hostage, all right?"
I've already shot one of them.
I'm angry and unpredictable.
Look at me!
"What we're doing here, we're waiting for the FBI."
There's two more security officers coming from other parts of the campus.
"Yeah, so?"
What do you want me to do about them?
"-That's up to a jury, sir."
But she's behind bars?
"She's not getting out, right?"
-What kind of bail?
-That's up to the judge.
"A woman like that is a danger, like the one who cut off her husband's dick."
These are the people they lock up and throw away the key.
That should do it.
"Thanks for your time, Mr. Fuentes."
MR. FUENTES:
Sure.
-Mrs.
"Fuentes, gracias."
You'll let us know if she gets out on bail?
Notify us somehow or another?
"Yeah, sure, we could do that if you want."
"Yeah, sure."
"-Anyway, thanks for your cooperation."
-Sure.

Yeast infection?
How much is that gonna cost?
"I spent a month in the hospital, it didn't cost that much."
"How old is this dog, anyway?"
You think he's gonna live for a while?
"All right, okay."
is there any chance that this could be a special dog...
"... maybea purebred,anything?"
"No, it wouldn't, huh?"
"All right, well, you got my Visa, go ahead and treat the dog."
-How we doing on those supplementals?
-Okay.
The dog... just Greta.
She was in the bathroom.
"Well, what was she doing?"
That's the funny thing.
She was pulling the curling iron out of the water by the cord.
"Boy, that's some smart dog."
Maybe she heard the girl scream when the curler hit the water.
I guess that's what happened.
"God, I don't know."
[Siren wailing]
There's something more.
What?
How did the dog get in?
"She was locked out, I'm sure."
"Well, maybe... maybe the girl let her in."
No.
She was in the tub.
I remember Monique slumped down under the water.
Eyes were still open.
Oh?
"Well, she's propped up against the end of the tub now."
"Well, I pulled her up from under the water."
"I was hoping she was still breathing, but she wasn't."
But who is she?
What was she doing here?
"Monique Berger, a friend."
She lives across the street.
They're working on the plumbing system.
[Siren wailing]
Anything else I should do?
"No, just stay in there and see they"
Don't make a mess of things.
We never thought of a Frenchman.

Here we go.
"Say, do you want to share a taxi with us to the hotel?"
"That's kind of you, Doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first."
- 0h. 0K.
"- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?"
I'll be there later and perhaps we might have a drink together.
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.
"- ln that case, I will take you to dinner."
"- No, no."
That's not fair.
I know Marrakech.
I can show you an Arab restaurant where the food is different and the manner of eating exotic.
That's what we came here for.
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- l'd love it.
"How would you prefer to travel to the hotel, by taxi?"
"- Gee, I don't know."
- A wagon!
I wanna ride in a wagon!
I guess it's a wagon.
See you later.
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
"Hank, you sit up with the driver."
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
It looks like a type of disorder that's rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures.
"We call it ""somnambular-form possession. """
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
Like John Garfield in Body And Soul.
Exactly.
John Garfield.
"Do people tell you that, Father?"
Do people say you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
You know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
I think we've gone through...
-...too much together.
-Yeah.
"We'II always be part of each other, Iike, growing up."
I'm just glad that we did it right from the start how we wanted to do it.
Yeah.
There's been so many bands that have come and gone.
And no one really talks about them anymore.
"I'd Iike to be like, remembered for the records that we did."
Do you know what?
"It'd just be amazing to be remembered like, even as a mum telling her daughter:"
"""The boy band at my time, One Direction, they just had fun."""
Do you know what I mean?
"""They were just normal guys but terrible, terrible dancers."""
Yeah.
Are they down here?
I'm excited to see what's gonna happen.
"Two, one."
"Everybody, three, two, one."
So I'm gonna just get in the car up here.
"Come on, girls."
Can't believe actually today's here.
have a present for you.
There you go.
-congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.
The key.
Right.
Are we ready?
"Say, you in the blue serge suit!"
You look like a man with sporting blood flowing in your veins!
Would you like to see the forbidden quarter of Algiers?
"Gather around closer, please!"
I've a little item to show you!
This is called the ever-writing ballpoint pen!
Sells for $ 15 in the leading stores!
"Back up a little, please, you bother me!"
You can write as easy with your left hand as your right!
It doesn't make a difference!
You geeked it!
And I had a buck on you!
You're yellow!
You should've taken that with you!
- Maybe you could've hit him with it!
- Leave him alone!
"He don't mean nothing, Tony!"
I don't mind!
A fight's only a fight!
- I still got that million-to-one shot!
"- Okay, boys!"
Main event on!
"- Get ready, main event!"
- Luth!
Intermission's about over!
"Hey, Mickey!"
Give Stoker a hand with his bandages!
Main event in the ring!
I wish I had the champ in there tonight!
"I know I'm right, Gus!"
"Tell you, I can feel it!"
"- Okay, boy!"
"Yeah, yeah."
Hannah's response:
"""Nobody's perfect,"
"But this guy's a super, super jerk""."
Oh man.
My mom watches Leno.
Well if it makes you feel any better.
"Both Miley and Hannah love their ""super, super jerk""."
Well I'm glad you think this is funny.
But you're not the one who's a talk show punch line?
You're a cute punch line.
"Oh Jesse, come on!"
Oh come on Jesse.
I know it's my fault but...
"Okay this is where you say ""No it's not your fault honey."
"We're in this together""."
Let me try it again.
Jesse I know it's my fault but...
Your turn.
"Doesn't have to be ""honey""."
"Could be ""lamb chop cupcake..."""
Miley.
Oh come on.
You can do better than that.
You don't get it.
"Everybody in America knows me as the super, super jerk."
Who broke Hannah Montana's heart?
Everybody?
"Now come on, you're being a little dramatic."
I mean the people that know you and love you don't feel that way.
[Cell phone buzzing]
Really?
"Hendricks is in hospital, Andre and the others are dead, so let's not fuck up anymore."
- And who are you?
- I'm Mr Crawford's CEO.
The code word for this is Scylla and Charybdis.
"Now move it, soldier, we have a package to collect."
"Go, guys."
"Crawford, wake up."
Look.
Government troops.
Army checkpoint.
"Well, that's good, isn't it?"
"I'll name drop Matak, we'll get an escort back to Khartoum."
- What?
- I don't know.
- What are they doing out here?
- Patrolling?
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us.
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember?"
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favour?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
- What's he saying?
- Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
We press on.
We hit that checkpoint.
"If the soldiers are friendly, we'll have more firepower against the Janjaweed."
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on my command."
"Guys, I know."
We work in a firehouse.
I know everything you guys know.
"All right, and believe me, I say this as a dad."
"You know, no dad could be prouder to find out that his daughter is terrible in bed."
- Right.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
"- You know what, to colleen."
"May she continue to make tommy's life miserable for many, many, many more years to come."
"Here, here."
"Mike, do me a favor.Call shawn in the morning, will you, find out what's going on."
Ok.
"Holy shit, guys."
Another 8 grandioso.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Awesome.
Nice.
"You know, we gotta give some of this to charity, don't you think?"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"That's a good idea, right?"
"Hey, charity."
Yeah.
"Yeah, let's not do that."
That sucks.
What's wrong with you?
"You know, guys, my mother made all this possible."
"You know, maybe we should give it to like a cancer charity or something."
"Yeah.Yeah, that is a really good idea, actually."
"Well, wait a second, shitbird."
I thought you said we we weren't doing it.
Brother Ia...
"Vetoes to the excrement, you joke but there is something does not fit."
Clear that there is something does not fit.
"Lella is with you because your parents have money, have the bar."
"It is not truth, Lella is a good girl."
"In addition it does not matter, I want to me to Lella."
Heavy what with that Lella.
"In short, what you need she is a woman."
You love a woman for tonight?
"Yes, Yes."
We provided to him a woman for tonight?
"Yes, proporciónamela I want it, please."
How much money you have?
Money?
You have money?
Me no.
"Delay, hopes..."
I have a currency.
You do not worry.
"Sex is question of times and methods and if there are no them,"
Ios we invented.
-Young lady?
-20.000.
Put a hand on the heart.
"Ah, no."
"By less than 20,000 there is nothing no to do."
"Allow me, I am Dr. Cicchirini of the University Clinica..."
"Ah, yes?"
And what matters to me?
"One is a human case, a case that... only you can solve."
Créame.
It has come specifically to take the hair me?
X-ray shows another reason for his condition.
There's a bullet-like metal thing in his brain.
The metal thing is moving.
It's pressing on his nerves.
"If we don't remove it, he'll go into a coma in 3 weeks."
He may even die.
Can't it be removed?
"We want to, but we are not confident."
Sorry.
Thanks.
You're awake.
How are you?
OK.
"What's wrong, Lisa?"
Why didn't you tell me?
What's that thing in your head?
Doctor says if it's not removed... you've only 3 weeks to live.
You tell me now.
It's nothing.
I got shot 3 years ago when on duty.
"I didn't remove it, afraid it'd affect me."
It's been in there since.
I've fainted many times before.
Don't worry.
Only it was longer this time.
I scare of such an unconscious feeling.
I'm afraid to sleep.
Afraid I'll never wake up again.
Lucky you guys were with me this time.
What's wrong?
3 years ago...
Is this reason you stopped courting me?
Better never late is more like it.
I believe you two know each other.
- Sure do.
"Hey, Spence."
"- Hey, Chloe."
"( panting ) This is my partner, Joe."
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
"We'll be just a second, sir."
"Wayne, look, just one drink, that's all I'm asking."
"You showed me everything I needed to see, Spencer."
You're a good guy.
"But if you can't make a lunch, how are you gonna move a team or build a stadium on schedule?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me, we have a plane to catch."
"You fly private, though, right?"
( laughing )
Yeah.
"I mean, the plane leaves when you do."
"Is that what you know from experience, Joe?"
It's something I've learned from my grotesquely irresponsible client roster.
Spencer:
"Wayne, just one drink."
You're gonna wanna hear what I gotta say.
- What do you think?
- ( car alarm chirps )
I'm actually curious.
( chuckles ) She's curious.
Tell me what it is you think
"I'm gonna wanna hear, Spencer."
I just met with the Cowboys.
- Underlings?
She made me realize
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I know that now.
I'm three months pregnant and you're already out trying to fuck other women!
What's gonna happen 10 years from now?
How could I ever trust anything you say again?
Jenna.
"Fuck you, man."
It's over.
- Jenna.
- Get out right now.
I'll tell you when you can come back and get your shit.
Maybe Kimmy can help you pack.
"- Jenna, we're having a baby."
- No.
"No, I am the one having this baby."
"I'm the pregnant one, not you."
And she's better off with no father than a lying asshole like you!
You're overreacting.
It was a couple kisses.
"After three years, Jenna, things happen."
"- Not to me, they don't!"
Get out!
- And go where?
Get out of here!
Go back to fucking Kim!
"What, are you gonna fucking stab me, Jenna?"
- Get out!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Get the fuck out!
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Pff.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
"You know what, I just figured out what your costume is."
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh!
Oh!
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story!
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!"
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"I don't know, something about me being too into myself."
"Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack."
You?
But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
"Maybe she was a good teacher when she was younger,"
"But now that she's older, she just doesn't care anymore."
Yeah.
"I'm a lot younger than her,"
And I don't really care anymore.
"She's jaded and burned-out, and the last thing"
"She should be doing is teaching kids that young,"
But does the school system care
That she is creating a hostile learning environment?
"No, because the school system is broken, mike!"
It's broken.
You're right.
Somebody should do something.
They should.
Where you going?
Bed.
But we're in the middle of a conversation.
Really?
I was at the end.
Night.
"Well, maybe mike could turn it off,"
"But I was too worked up to sleep,"
So I called my sister...
"I mean, when a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
I called my mom...
"When a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
"And at 3:00 in the morning, I'd had enough talk."
Hey.
What are you doing up so early?
I never came to bed.
- It comes with a free cigarette.
"- Oh, no."
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.
"Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it."
"No, no, no."
Don't do that... smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
Hey...
Ahh.
We seem to be in the clear.
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf...
it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
"I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe."
"Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my God!"
It's gonna be fine.
"Oh, my God!"
"I got rifles, vests, flash grenades..."
"Chips, dips, ice cream sammies..."
"I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
Really?
Then what is this?
"Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
We need to talk to the Civil Guard.
Have them step up surveillance at the Point.
We have to find whoever owns that heroin.
I'll take the river.
I'll take Quini.
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT
Yes.
"Okay, thanks a lot."
Marina's at her house.
Her mother says she's fine.
The Civil Guard is mixed up in all of this.
Someone's tipping them off.
The whole town smokes American tobacco and there's not a single butt on any of the boats.
They have to get by on something between harvests.
Go in.
Sit there.
- I'm fine standing.
"- Sit, damn it."
What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?
"Yes, I do."
Nobody ever explained it to you?
- Who's the man in the hat?
- What man?
"The guy who went in after you, before I got my head bashed in."
Nobody came in.
"I told you, we were alone."
"You want my blood, is that it?"
"Call the doctor, I'll wait."
Too bad you didn't bring your pajamas.
You're sleeping here.
"Truth or Dare, Mr. Gimp?"
"Sorry, what was that?"
- I can't hear you.
- Leave him alone.
"Shut your trap, ugly!"
Gemma.
Gemma.
"Oh, no."
This is all your fault.
Think about it.
When exactly did Felix string himself up?
The night after the party?
No.
The night before his big brother came home.
"Truth, Felix..."
Who were you afraid of?
Who made you so fucking scared that you'd rather die?
Than have him find out what happened.
"Show me with your eyes, Felix."
Show him.
"What's this about, brother?"
It was meant to be a fucking joke.
A little prank... to teach my lazy arse boyfriend a lesson
"I was drunk, Felix was willing."
A little too willing.
That's what this is about.
Isn't it?
He hanged himself!
My dad's company went down the pan a few months ago.
"Not that you'd give a toss, Justin!"
But I thought that just maybe the Hautbois family could help out.
"I sent Felix an email... very polite... wondering if, uh, he could talk to his family about refloating my dad's company."
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
"And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear."
"""Wake up, number 37""."
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
That chip allows you to see the future.
"Yeah, I can see the attraction."
"You have to tell me what's going on, Artie."
"Well, he may have figured it out already."
Seriously?
"I mean, it's Pete we're talking about."
I can't get ahold of him.
His cell keeps going to voice mail.
- Alice has obviously the Farnsworth.
- Dude...
He's in a big hotel.
There was this man at the bar one night bragging about how he miraculously survived the inferno.
He said that this chip saved his life.
- And you stole it?
- It's what we do.
"Pete Lattimer, white courtesy telephone."
"Jillian, take the money and run, don't walk."
Find a beach.
Never look back.
I am gonna go get your husband.
"Wait, hold on."
You're not arresting us?
You're letting us go?
"What happens in Vegas, okay?"
Just get outta here.
It looks like you were telling the truth.
Don't hurt Jillian.
Do you know what?
Hurting is half the fun.
You wanna know what's more fun?
The other half.
Who are you?
"Is he a stranger?"""
"""Is he for real, or just a legend?"""
"""He stares at me, from far, far away"""
"""Tell him not to rob me of my sleep"""
"""The one who comes in my dreams..."""
"""the one who teases me..."""
"""just ask him to face me, once"""
"""Some kind of spell is overcoming me"""
"""Oh what do I do?"
"My heart yearns so"""
"""My heart tells me it's mad for you."
"Then why do you keep hiding from me?"""
"""He makes me blossom, it's all his fault"""
"""Tell him, I'm asking for the Moon"""
"""The one who comes in my dreams..."""
"""the one who teases me..."""
"""just ask him to face me, once"""
Raj!
This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation!
Hurry!
Is it a holiday...?
What Raj...?
Late for your graduation?
What to do?
Last night...
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided... to announce his name in public
Don't overstep.
"Rebecca,there he is."
Walk me to him.
"- Doc,stay here.Call Tanner."
- You got it.
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser,just hang on.We're gonna get you off that thing."
"No,you're not."
Let me help you.You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh,I know.Just can't see from up there."
"So what I told you on the phone,that help you catch him?"
Windward elementary.
- So I was right.
- Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb,""Twin Tree"" clue,you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'Il be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news,just give it to me straight."
He modified it.I'm gonna have to improvise.
"But I'm not referring to you, Moonsook."
You're different from your films.
"Sorry, but you're actually just another Korean man."
What are you sorry about?
"No, I take that back."
My point is you are a Korean man.
"Hey, I'm going back to our room."
I'll be back shortly.
Not coming with me?
That was a hit-by-pitched ball.
Stricter rules will apply to this.
"If you let the ball hit you when you could've dodged it, it's either a ball or a strike."
Like a regular strike or ball.
"Even if you get hit, it may not be a hit-by-pitched ball."
- Doesn't apply to intentional hits.
"- Yes, that's right."
He's in the bathroom.
Want to get some fresh air?
"Yeah, sure."
Wait.
This way.
I don't think we can go any farther.
Shoes are all wet.
- You know what?
- Yes?
"As I get older, I like the west coast."
It's where the sun sets.
And also where the stars rise.
That's right.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
"Ah, I got a question."
"Hey,don't walk away from me."
All right.Stay here and talk to him.
- About what?
- About what happened.
- l don't know what happened.
"- You have,like,50 theories.Just pick one."
*************
"""Emerson Hauser."" This was his case."
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains,the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving,when,in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"- You don't know what happened,do you?"
- No.
- Does anybody?
- Probably.
Okay.Pine street.
Windward elementary.
"""Sunset."" Where the hell is ""Sunset""?"
Sandstone paint.
Sand.
"$651,000.That's what, 55 years of back pay the government never gave you?"
They owe me.They stole my star.They took my pension.
Who are you?
"I wrote a book about Alcatraz,and pretty much everything in it is wrong."
You write about me?
- No.
- Why not?
I was there.I was important.The Warden said so himself.
"Gave me the royal treatment,him and his lady head-shrinker."
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That didn't including shooting your fellow agents.
Those guys should have never been there.
That's not the point.
That's exactly the point.
God damn it David.
You shot three agents.
I winged them.
I tried to keep them alive.
Which is more than they did for me.
They didn't know who you were.
I told them.
I surrendered.
What do you want me to do?
So are you taking me off the case or what?
"No, I wish I could."
"Believe me I wish I could, but no."
Is that it?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
"No, littman told me to find out if you had gone nuts."
"So, I'm going to tell him you haven't, right?"
You tell him whatever you want.
Oh no.
"I'm going to tell him that you haven't, right?"
Will that be all?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Hello, Mr. Davis."
I am yuko.
How are you doing?
Mr. sawamato said you found this place empty.
"Maybe we could find out who it is, at least."
"You know, check and see if somebody died bloody around here or something."
Way ahead of you.
I had to break into the principal's office to get this.
"Oh, and FYI, three of the cheerleaders are legal."
Guess which ones.
No.
"So, there was only one death on campus."
It was a suicide back in '98.
Some kid named Barry Cook.
What?
I knew him.
How did he die?
He slit his wrists in the first-floor girls' bathroom.
That's where...
Right where the chick got swirleyed to death.
Exactly.
"So, what?"
This ghost is possessing nerds?
"And using them to go after bullies, yeah."
"Well, does that sound like Barry's M.O.?"
Barry had a hard time.
"- Thanks, Sam."
- Great school.
I don't care.
"Three years, and I'm out of here."
I'm going to Michigan State.
They got the best vet program in the country.
You like animals?
They're a lot nicer than people.
"So tonight I'm thinking you, me, a bucket of popcorn, extra butter."
"Mm, kinky."
"She did excellent in school, the Sisters said."
"Got good grades, was in every club."
"She was quitting drugs, you know."
She promised our priest.
What else you got there?
is that a diary?
Do either of you have children?
"Yeah, I got a boy."
"Are you close to him, detective?"
-Not at present.
-Something happens that's not right...
... youknow.
You know about your kids.
"-Yeah, I guess you do."
-l knew.
Even before I read this...
"... Iknewshewas involvedwith someone who hurt her, some married bastard."
"She tried 20 times to split up with him, but..."
... shewasweakbecauseofthedrugs.
"This time, she promised Father Kelleher."
"She was ready this time, and this bastard took her chance away."
Can we see this?
MCBRlDE:
"Here, read this."
It says it right here.
"""Mike says if I leave him, he'll kill me."
"He says if I'm going to call his wife again, he's going to kill me. """
She read to me from this.
She gave this to me.
"Look, listen."
"""l am definitely going to quit drugs."
"I am definitely going to change my life with Father Kelleher's help. """
The internal bleeding dance!
- I could sure use some help too.
"- You got it, partner!"
- Move!
I want the fat one!
"- They're all fat, Biatch!"
"Say mister, you got any other leads on where I can get some more bullets?"
"The other place got into a crime scene, long story."
"Just do some thinkin' on it, okay?"
Are you expectin' anybody else?
Are you sure?
It might be back up for Donnie's crew.
"Maybe they're supposed to call in, you know, like we do."
Why didn't they just come right in like everybody else has?
"I don't know, who the hell he is, I'm out of bullets again."
I'll get it.
What?
Wait but...
what if Donnie's other guys?
- I know what they'll do.
- I thought you wanted us to kill you.
You jealous?
- Kinda.
- Now take the fire escape.
I'll stall.
Otherwise they're gonna kill us all today after see what happened in here.
Go!
- You should come too!
"- No, no, I shouldn't."
This way I buy you some time.
Go!
Please.
And I'm proud of you.
All right.
And that's that.
Court dismissed.
"Well, I told you."
Keep your mouth shut or you'll be sorry.
"Jim, come here."
"Come here and let a guy talk to you, will you?"
What brought you back?
What's the difference?
"We're back, ain't we?"
"Charlie, I think you'd better go up and get fixed up."
"Go ahead, kid."
"Sit down, Jim."
Sit down.
I'm not going to ask you why you beat it.
I can guess that easy.
"Well, we'll let that go."
"I wanna ask, I want you to tell me the truth."
What's the matter?
Don't you like the way we treat you?
Don't you like us?
What is it?
Let's have it.
Give us a break.
There must be something you like to do.
Patsy wants to help you do it.
You're the mayor of this place.
You don't act like it.
"Well, I didn't ask for the job."
"Listen, kid."
I'm gonna tell you something and it's just between us.
I want you to take the gown out of your bag and put it on.
-This isn't appropriate for public.
-You don't understand naked.
Naked is inner.
I am here with you.
There is no shame.
There is no separation.
And I'm not ill.
"Yes, you are ill, Gloria."
And I have no need for a green synthetic nightie used to conceal the essence of my supple skin and my aching soul in the barren desert that is this land.
I'm moving in with my son in Costa Mesa.
He thinks I'm lonely.
"Truth is, he's lonely."
Sweet kid.
Just can't seem to connect.
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
"It's lovely, really."
It's really lovely.
You seem like a very nice person.
I hope you take the place.
-Come on.
-Come on!
You're nothing!
Come on!
Pussy!
Fucking pussy!
I don't know about trust.
Maybe she just needed a nap or something.
Believe me.
She's been belligerent with everybody else.
I dealt with her last year.
"I just listened to her, really."
We are going nowhere.
"Until we've got fingers again, obviously."
Great!
You've done a really good job.
It's very... secure.
Thanks.
"And don't worry, it unlocks just as easily as it locks."
"Oh, no."
Ah...
Kidding.
I'm kidding.
I was just...
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- He doesn't say much.
- That's Steve.
He takes a while to warm up to new people.
"So, who are you exactly?"
I'm you.
I thought you looked familiar.
"12 years ago, I was the kid no-one believed."
I'm...
I saw something too.
"An animal, a creature, really."
"I was walking where I'd walked 100 times before and for some reason that day, there it was."
I've never seen anything like it before or since.
You never saw it again?
But I knew what I'd seen.
"For a while, I tried to convince other people I'd seen it, too."
I don't need to tell you how that went.
My parents practically measured me for my own strait jacket.
I know how it feels when the people you rely on most don't believe you.
- Attaboy.
- When we got married... it was supposed to be for better or worse.
"Only I gave the better, and you gave the worse."
What are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it.
Laverne!
I'm washing my hands of both of you!
You're rotten to the core!
You deserve each other!
"Sign it ""John Hancock."" It's my Declaration of Independence."
Okay!
That's wonderful.
At last you're a free man.
- You got your whole life ahead of you.
- I'm a free man!
- Right.
- I'm also an idiot.
- What do you mean?
"- There's just one hitch, and it lasts six years."
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I went to the colonel and had him swear me in.
"You mean, after all he said..."
Colonel Potter swore you in anyway?
"Yeah, yeah."
He even welcomed me aboard.
"Oh, I'm so stupid!"
What have I done?
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be all right.
You just relax and let hotter heads prevail.
I don't believe this.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"- Come on, Slug, let's get our dough back."
"I'm sorry, but you can't take the dog inside."
- Fido wouldn't make a bit of trouble.
"- Sorry, but it's against the rules."
I'll have you understand I'm not a madam.
"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
I'm sorry.
- Take your hands off me.
- What's the trouble here?
- The lady has a dog.
- You needn't have been so rude about it.
"Poor Fido, did he hurt-um?"
- May I take your dog?
- No.
I'll give him back to you after the performance.
You're sure you'll take good care of him?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
That's the second complaint I've had in five minutes.
- I must be slowing up.
- I think we can get along without you.
"- Aw, you hurt me."
- Turn in your uniform.
"Listen, Fido, this guy's got a wooden leg."
Try it sometime.
I dub you lieutenant.
[CHATTERING]
Uh-huh.
Did it again.
That's four pairs in a row.
"If this keeps up, I'm gonna buy you a fur coat."
I'm in the middle of it.
We'll take care of it.
We'll manage.
We'll get it done.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Fine.
Bye.
I do like my drink.
It goes hand in hand with playing.
It's a given.
A morning break drink.
"Before that, three spritzers just so I can talk."
"Then, with the morning break drink, 10 spritzers."
"And afterwards a few shots, because everything's gone so well."
But I'm predisposed because my whole family drinks.
Is dinner ready?
This is our basement den.
We don't use it as often as before.
- We used to celebrate birthdays here.
- We don't celebrate here anymore.
"My son was a musician, he'd play for us."
"On birthdays, Christmas, New Year's."
We always had such a good time.
We had Mardi Gras parties.
"We had Mardi Gras parties, but... that's all over."
"Yup, pretty much."
"The carpets here, actually..."
I'm no fan...
"I'm no fan of carpets, but my wife..."
"It doesn't fit upstairs, but it cost a lot, so I put it down here."
- Nowadays...
"I'm used to it, but you?"
Are you saying you don't want to see me?
I'm saying that I'm scared of losing you.
The people I love all end up turning their back on me.
I won't be able to bear it if you do.
I don't fucking care if the judge can't find me a new home.
I'll manage.
Where will you sleep?
Under a bridge or on a bench.
"Anyway, it's cool you called me."
You'll sleep on a bench.
Or in a squat.
But it's dodgy.
There are always problems.
Sleep at my place.
We'll find a solution tomorrow.
Your place?
Just for tonight.
And don't tell anyone.
I'm not supposed to put you up.
Can I finish my pizza or should we go now?
"Go ahead, finish it."
I'll go and pay.
Your bathroom's so clean.
Don't you ever wash?
Help me with the sheet.
What are those marks?
Nothing.
You live alone?
- Yes.
"- You don't have a girlfriend, a wife?"
- I'm divorced.
"I'm sure you are, Jake."
"You ask me to take point, and then you kind of undercut my authority in there."
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
We could've closed it clean for 1.75.
I know.
So now we just sit it out?
"Liz has cancer, Jake."
What?
Found out last night.
Is it serious?
Mm-hmm.
"Burton, I'm so sorry."
"You know, you should have told me about this before the meeting."
"I--I am trying to get vortex as our client, and I--I really don't want to do a deal with them that can turn out badly."
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
The U.S. attorney wants names from kalaya.
What does kalaya get?
Protection from the thai penal system.
Come on.
She'll be dead in the streets.
Yeah.
That's why I didn't take the deal.
I lined up a couple of prospective foster parents.
Do you think we have any kind of a shot in here today?
"Probably not, Ms. Agnes."
Hmm.
Liz:
How did it go today?
"Well, they want you to get life insurance."
Heh!
I can't do it.
And your... pathetic tantrums threaten us all.
Hmm?
This is not me accepting.
This room here on the left will be your room.
"On the right, take note, is the bathroom, if you need to wee-wee or something else."
"Now, this here is your room."
Isn't that fantastic?
I think there is a game of Buckaroo downstairs.
One of the other guests must have left it behind.
- Bucka-fucking-roo?
- Yes.
It's a fantastic game for two to eight players.
"Oh, for... forget it."
I was just trying to think of things to keep you occupied.
I can keep myself occupied.
"Oh, God, you're a teenage boy."
Of course you can.
- Hello!
- Shit a brick!
Don't you knock?
"Oh, no, I don't have to."
Being dead has some perks.
Not with me.
I don't want ghosts popping up all over the place.
It freaks me out.
You're a 46-year-old vampire who dresses like a child.
Don't call her freaky.
Up.
"Anyway, just, er... came to see how you boys are getting on."
Uh.
Badly.
Ah.
Keep going.
"[Man On TV] You're in a very small, select group of guys."
What is it that makes you successful... and all the others knocking on the doors not so successful?
[Man #2] I'm not so sure.
"As i travel, i see television guys who would make good game show hosts."
- But i don't tell 'em.
- [Laughter]
"To me, a game show host is the icing on the cake."
But the format is the cake.
No one -
[Man Talking]
I'll love you till the day i die.
Yes!
And again.
"[Man] At 2.15 that afternoon, Johnny Clay -"
"[TV Continues, Faint]"
- He's expecting me.
- Come in.
I don't know why I did it.
It all unraveled and then one thing happened after another.
Jesus.
"I'm still in shock, boss."
"I'm in so much trouble, Larry."
No man becomes wise without stepping on the soil of fools.
Right.
Right!
But I never claimed to be a -
That's good.
Where did you get that?
Is that from the Bible?
It's from this play I wrote in eighth grade about Evel Knievel.
- Oh.
You must be Ms.Cole?
Missus.
Ah!
Splendid.
Please take a seat.
Husband in forces?
He volunteers as an air-raid warden.
But he wasn't fit for conscription.
He fought in the war in Spain.
Splendid!
That's splendid.
"Now, about the job."
We need to cultivate a more convincing female angle in our output.
"Mr.Buckley here, has been appointed to the department as a Special Advisor."
"Not ""Special"" enough to get paid, obviously."
"He seems to think, you are what we need."
"I said, ""Might be""."
She can't be worse than the chaps you got.
Did you write...this?
Hm..hmm.
This rapta-rama chips?
I...
I was the secretary at the copy-writing department.
But...all the copywriters got called up.
"""So-be-fee."
"It ain't beef, but it ain't bad!"" Yes, sometimes, you have to make do of what you got."
Ah!
Splendid.
Ministry wages start at £3 and £10.
And obviously we can't pay you as much as the chaps.... so shall we say £2 a week?
Thank you.
You a cinema goer?
"No, that's avoiding a fight and getting to the tv faster."
I didn't think you were ever gonna do anything.
"As long as I've known you,"
You've been all talk and no action.
You found a rat's foot in a can of chili and never got around
To writing a letter.
I was just so mad at ms.
Rinsky!
Why are you talking about ms.
Rinsky?
"It's nothing, honey."
Everything's fine.
"Well, I love ms."
Rinsky.
She's great.
She gives us candy when we get the answers right.
Yeah.
I know you like ms.
"Rinsky, but she's not perfect."
"Don't forget, you got a ""d"" on that test."
"Yeah, I'm thinking"
That might be 'cause I only answered three questions.
How many questions were there?
45.
Brick!
She said we could have free reading time
"When we finished the test, so I finished in five minutes."
"You're lucky you got a ""d."""
I know.
Ms. Rinsky's the best.
"So Axl and Sue decided, whatever it took,"
They were gonna help aunt Edie find that time capsule...
It's their atlas.
Do sit down.
"We are looking for a new home, and can only retain Thomas and Betsy."
We're sorry to have to leave you all.
But we are certain you will find the new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.
My only real concern is how long it will take them to move out.
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.
He has his own barouche.
- You have two brothers?
- Yes.
Edward is the elder.
He's travelling up from Plymouth and will break his journey here.
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...
This is your home now.
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?
One can presume she wants to count it.
What are you doing?
Gifts for the servants.
Where is Margaret?
She's taken to hiding.
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.
I have.
I've said yes and no.
"Good morning, Fanny."
"Good morning, Miss Marianne."
How did you find the silver?
"You're hiding something, please co-operate."
Co-operate?
What do I've?
"Nothing, let him come and take it."
Would I be like this if I had Rs.20 crores?
Leave me sir.
"Sir, he has two bank accounts, both are empty."
What's this trouble sir?
"If I don't get tea, my boss will dismiss me sir."
I'm going sir.
A link is missing.
He won't lie...no way.
Why did he send his photo then?
"He's a thief, why should he tell truth?"
"He can lie to us, right?"
May be the peon is lying.
Thank God!
"My money...crores of my money, where is it sir?"
You said you'd no money.
"Not mine, it's Minister's."
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?
How can I sir?
"I'm a proxy, trusted proxy of Minister."
He punched me and took everything.
Who is he?
How does he look?
Rajinikanth...superstar Rajinikanth punched me and took everything.
"I swear on my mother, it was Rajinikanth!"
My money...my money...
where's my money?
"Mother promise, superstar Rajinikanth took it away."
Bloody crap!
How?
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
-You could do it yourself.
"-No, I couldn't."
"I'd need Church approval, and that's rarely given."
Could you see her?
"Yes, I could."
I could see her as a psychiatrist--
Not a psychiatrist!
She needs a priest!
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you !
Are you gonna send me back to them?
"Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
You don't understand--
Can't you help her?
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I am the devil.
Now kindly undo these straps.
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
I just run into things.
You don't really feel them till you get offstage.
Hey... can you put that on pause?
Yes?
No?
Yeah!
Of course.
"First, it sounds loud but then after a half hour it's not so loud, you know?"
"And after, like, three quarter of an hour, it's not loud enough, you know?"
"I think the lyrics to some of that stuff that ""Are you with..."""
It was so smart... so fucking smart...
It's nice just rocking.
But it's rock and smart.
That's to me like at the...
"Great time...man, that's just so good to see someone doing that."
"If that's not what it is all about, I don't know what it is."
Hello.
I know in speaking English but I like the group.
"Thank you the pictures, thank you everyday."
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Head's up!
Dave!
Dave!
Dave!
Yeah!
"1, 2, 3..."
Nail it!
The chair!
What do you guys shooting at?
"Exit sign, why?"
"Come on, Buzz..."
"Dude, please, just one..."
You'll get hurt.
"Tell that to the governor, will you?"
"Hey, give me that."
"Never mind, Ponch."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Will be with you in a minute, okay?"
You can't write her a citation.
I can write her three citations for what she did.
You can't write her.
She's angry.
She's angry at us.
She's angry at the itsy-bit...
The signs.
She's angry with the state.
"She won't sign the ticket, she just..."
She won't accept it.
"Hey, the kid, huh?"
I can tell.
Okay?
- I'll hook her up and take her down.
- Take her down.
What you gonna do?
Tow her in?
That's gonna do a lot to beef up your arrest record.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Until we have time to do something about those signs maybe you can be a little more careful, okay?"
"Now, if you could just slide over."
"Nice Officer Poncherello will help you turn around, okay?"
You be careful now.
We don't want to get hurt.
She gave me a cookie.
But it's for you.
Give me 10 000 won.
How can there be a woman like you?
I'm not paying you.
You're not?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Wow!
Look at all these checks.
You don't need to tip.
Then...
I'm taking exactly 10 000 Won.
"I wish there was a subway station nearby, so I can change my clothes."
My hand phone!
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You...
Are you jealous?
Always asking me about my sponsor.
"If you're talking about money, I also have a lot of money."
I can surpass that old man completely.
The police have been secretly taking good care of him.
And he gives them a lot of bribes.
Bribes?
"The construction will receive bribes, we need some connection from inside, all the staff members take bribes."
Did you see it?
Did you see them taking money?
Hello.
There is a lady here asking for you to come to the parking lot.
She said her hand phone is in your car.
"Ah, she's crazy."
I don't know that woman.
I was the 10 000 Won person from earlier.
"Why you put up ""Sold""?"
Because it is sold to another party.
"A shoe company, Axel."
"They wanted a bigger area, but--"
No.
You cannot.
Now you listen to me.
I warned you I couldn't wait.
"I'd be a fool to, particularly after that check bounced."
Like I told the church committee--
"Wait, wait."
Bounced?
What check bounced?
"That personal check for 50,000 from Somers."
"I wanted to tell you about it the day I talked to you, but she didn't want me to."
She?
Your friend from Beverly Hills.
"Axel, I know Miss Morrow's done quite a good promotion job."
At least she sure did sweep everybody around here off their feet.
"If you got something inside, say it."
Don't make up the words.
I tried to get hold of her all day.
Best I could do was a lot of messages she was tied up someplace.
"Tied up, my foot."
My wife saw her car parked at a bar down the highway not more than two hours ago.
- Where?
- Outside a motel.
The Windmill Inn.
## [loud jazz]
Lars!
Lars!
Come here quick!
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you want to go get a drink?
"- No, I'd better not."
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
"- No, I'm not hungry."
- Want me to take you home?
- Okay.
"- Good to see you, Henry."
"- But Greg, you said..."
"Bye, Henry."
"- Candy, don't leave."
- That was great.
I thought you were gonna stay.
"Well, we're done."
Is my shoe here?
"Well, Candy, I still have feelings for you."
But I dumped you for another man.
How could you still have feelings for me?
"- Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul."
- I thought that was over.
"Well, he was cheating on me."
I guess I wanted to feel better about myself before I see him tomorrow night.
That's why you're here?
"Well, yeah."
"Look, you were always such a nice guy, but let's face it, we have nothing in common except sex and the fact that you idolize me."
I really do care for you.
Really.
I just can't wind up with you.
Can I call you sometime?
What for?
"- Rose, are you going, or what?"
I even tracked down Mrs. Klinger.
"FYI, if you want some vodka, get it now."
"And, uh... here is... a first edition of Charlotte's Web, which I believe was your favorite book from that year."
Can I see you for a moment?
Excuse us.
I can't take it anymore.
"I know you love me, I do, but I am drowning in it."
"Sweetie, I think we-"
Shh!
Who does this?
It's like...
"On our birthdays, I got you a sweater."
You had a plane skywriting for me-
"Seriously, this just-"
Shh!
And it's not just the big days.
It's every day.
Cute little notes under my pillow.
And in the refrigerator.
And in my diaphragm case.
"Oh, I-"
It is too much.
And I don't think there is a woman in the world who would disagree with me!
"God, I would."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, but..."
I
- I'm sorry.
It's-but
"- Everything you just said sounded really, really nice."
"I mean, seriously, if I had someone doing amazing, travagant things for me every day, I"
- I think I'd just shut up.
With your best friends as an escort.
- Why is he here?
- Ogawa?
That guy makes me itch.
"Well, the Japanese want their tsuba back."
"With the sword gone, it's all that's left of a national treasure."
Don't worry.
They're leaving tonight for Japan.
"By tomorrow, the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet."
"By the way, just to ask it, who did give you that file on Artie?"
That's my secret to keep.
"Cooper, see that they get on their plane."
No detours.
"Yeah, and--and don't rule out shooting them if necessary."
What's going on?
What?
It's Ogawa. it was him at the embassy.
He walked out with the sword.
- Are you sure?
"- Myka, I saw him."
You have to trust me.
Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file.
Artie was right.
"Yeah, and now he's got the sword and the tsuba."
Heading for the diplomatic terminal.
There's no security.
"How about you both just take a time-out, huh?"
Just for the drive to Dulles.
Let's go.
Bored?
Yeah.
"Oh, finally."
All right.
Do your ears.
One at a time.
"Okay, bend your heads over, shake them out with your fingers."
Put your hands above your head.
Hands out in front of you.
Over.
Move those fingers.
Reach down and lift up your nut sack.
"Drop your nut sacks, and skin back your dick."
Turn around.
"One foot at a time, pick it up and wiggle the toes."
Other foot.
"Bend over, grab your ass, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs."
(MEN COUGHING)
Stand right there.
julie:
You're like two people.
Inmate Montoya Santana?
One is like a kid.
Doesn't know how to dance.
Step this way.
Doesn't know how to make love.
That's the one I cared about.
Step inside.
But the other one...
The other one I hate.
"Τhe one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs."
Who kills people!
SANΤANA:
"Until now, I would've thought it a sign of weakness to even listen to what you said to me that night."
But I see that you were right.
I can't believe it.
-She--
-You don't think a psychiatrist...?
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"-Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
-Yeah.
So in the meantime try not to worry.
How?
"The edema affected her brain, you understand?"
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, talking to the radio."
-You should've called me when it happened.
-Listen.
Regular hospital not gonna put up with that.
"We give her a shot and bring her here until the doctors fix up her leg, then we take her right out."
"Two or three months and she's out, good as new."
-Miss?
-Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.
-Are you a relative?
"-Yes, I am her brother."
He is her son.
Just a minute.
"You know, it's funny."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist on Park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of there."
"You go in, Dimmy."
I'll wait for you outside.
It is already there!
"Were you there, Mrs Thielbacke?"
They called neither for me nor a doctor.
Well!
Hold it then!
My hands are so dirty.
"Come on, move!"
"Hold yourself straight, girl!"
What do I say if someone sees me?
That you've fetched your wages...
No hospital... is that at all doable?
"Well, there you see."
Isn't he a fine boy?
Didn't you also come into this world in your mother's bed?
But the due date was a long way off!
"Oh well, that's why I too didn't believe it when the pain sat in."
Then I would've called the doctor.
So you did it all alone...
A mother's soul
- All alone...
Bruno was there;
he helped me.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
I left the money and the papers in the car.
Bruno...
"Could I not return to Mrs Kunze, Bruno?"
Why do you ask questions?
"Nope, you'll stay with me for a couple of days!"
I'll find somewhere to sleep.
I've never been worried about that!
Oh my goodness... the bed!
"Instead of feeling sad thinking about silly past, I'm peaceful  happy now."
You bloody!
Sister!
What's this?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you bringing to our home?
What's your game?
My plan is...
Are you playing games?
May I tell you?
You fool!
Who are you?
Are you trying to play with me in India and my brother-in-law here?
Has he forgotten the past?
Is that why he didn't recognise me?
Hey Kick!
Now I got you in my hands.
"Give me some of your revenge, allow me to stay with him,"
I'll make him see stars in day time.
"One small request, don't tell anyone here about our story in India."
You too don't tell anyone about our plan.
Have you lost your memory?
Now I'll give you kick of the life.
Sleeping like a log.
I'll give him the shock of his life.
What's it Prakash?
Unable to sleep.
"Come, sleep."
- What happened?
- What's that?
This...
I hate any cloth on my body when I sleep except this blanket.
"Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
"No,"
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist.
The one wearing the male birth control.
I was gonna go with
"""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
"All right, he's a hero."
Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,"
I have a date.
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
Great.
Bring her in.
You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
Mm.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
I'd be happy to show you around.
Right.
Please follow me.
"- Go, go, go!"
"Quick, come on."
- Move.
"- Grab these ones, too."
- What are they doing in here?
Riley said I can't keep it up in my room any more.
- You can't keep it in the freaking kitchen.
- This is our common area.
"And as you can see, we keep a very tight cleaning schedule here at the house."
"We also like to focus on and stress education, music..."
Hot soup coming through!
"The kitchen, where we provide a well-balanced diet."
They're his pets.
Rescue rats.
Tweaker grew up in the basement of a candy store before coming here.
- They were his only friends.
- Take me to Mr Webb.
"Hey, clean the crumbs off the floor."
They're very clean for rats.
"Hi, I'm Randy Webb, home director."
I see you've met Furry and Scurry.
"Wonderful, lovely creatures, I assure you."
"This is not good, Mr Webb."
Not good at all.
"Come on, over here."
- Did you get what I needed?
"- You betcha, Ms Frazier."
Excellent.
"Two season tickets, third row, centre as promised."
He...
"He saved Roger, didn't he?"
Hey.
"Hey, the race is on."
"Oh, hey, man."
Spare me.
I don't want to look at no race.
I don't want to know nothing about no race.
Shh.
Today's running of the famed Iron Man Classic drew a record number of competitors.
"The big surprise of the event came in the last leg, the 100-mile bicycle portion, when a rider sponsored by Island Hoppers... suddenly reversed field as he exited the famed Austin Memorial Gardens."
"We've got some footage of that Island Hoppers biker, who certainly lived up to his sponsor's name."
"Whoever you are, Island Hopper, we admire your style."
Yeeha!
Look at...
And that's the news from all of us to all of you.
Good night.
ANGEL GUTS:
RED PORNO
There are perverts everywhere nowadays.
Hello?
Come on Nami.
You're my best friend.
"Do my shift tomorrow, please?"
I've got a date.
What job is it?
Can just anyone do it instead of you?
Yeah.
As long it's a woman.
It's very easy.
You just have to stand there doing nothing.
Humanity would live... once again.
The end
Mmm...
Mmm...
"You gotta wrap it up, Teddy."
"We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush."
I'm ready!
Let's go!
- Why do you have two bottles of wine?
- What?
It's a wine train.
Ooh.
You guys going on the wine train?
"Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin."
You don't have to bring it.
Oh...
"Otherwise, it would be just called a train."
Right.
"Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing?"
"It says right here in the brochure, ""Kids are allowed."""
"It says, ""Kids are allowed, ""but not welcome."""
Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore.
- Where's Gene?
- He's picking out his outfit.
I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene!
"Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners?"
- 'Cause we're going on a train!
"- Well, go put a shirt on."
"Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear."
Put on underwear.
Okay.
"I'm not in trouble, Carl, you are."
Please tell them they're wrong.
Did you kill Lawrence Ridgeway?
I'm sorry.
No.
You shot him?
It's my job to look out for you.
To look out for this family.
People depend on me.
"When they told me about the rifle,"
I thought... but I didn't want to believe it was you.
Ridgeway told me about the account.
"If that money disappeared, and they came asking, he would have pointed to me."
He was a loose end.
I had to protect us.
And why not blackmail the Secretary of the Navy while you're at it.
That was nothing ;
it was an empty threat.
It was a diversion.
Man is still dead.
"But that AUTEC money is just sitting there, and we're about to lose everything."
I did this for both of us.
"We needed it, Phillip."
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
"Oh, no."
"Vance nails you with the shredding detail, huh?"
"Yes, from redacted to unredacted to recycling to..."
"Tell me, I have a question."
Hmm?
Do you believe?
Believe in what?
Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!
"Look, guys, we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money."
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
"If we can't even win that, what's the point?"
"Hey, hey."
Look at this!
"No, no, no, no."
Yeah.
We suck.
"Your father would be so proud of you, Ben."
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really.
Maybe when he shaved?
"Yeah, I think I watched him shave."
"So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?"
I don't know.
I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
"Ben, you're working too hard."
"Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself."
"You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben."
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay.
All right.
- Good night.
"- All right, good night."
- Don't come home before 3:00.
You're Marta Kozlenko.
He was my father?
I lured my father to his death?
It wasn't your fault.
"He wanted it to look like a kidnapping, not a defection."
Somehow the KGB got onto us.
"We'll go to Zurich, first thing in the morning."
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
For what?
For all of this.
"Maybe if I hadn't called you or taken you out of your life, maybe..."
It would've happened anyway.
Whoever's after us needs my numbers too and you weren't just part of the job.
"I've always cared about you, I always will."
Marta.
Alright we have to get outta here.
What's wrong?
Police are downstairs.
We made the paper.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
You speak English?
We need you to drive us to Zurich.
We're not gonna hurt you.
But my deliveries.
I have customers.
Today we're you're only customers.
Don't even think about it.
"Thank you, Jann."
I hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
"Appreciate it if you can, uh, wait a couple hours before calling' the police."
- The truth.
- Why?
Because he could come back!
They've got a right to know.
- OK.
I'm coming with you.
- No.
- Let me take the blame.
- No!
"I got us into this, not you."
Although...
I'm in so much trouble
I think they might actually eat us.
I'll see you next time I'm allowed out.
Which is probably in the next 50 years or so.
You could leave them in the den till they promise not to punish you.
"Yeah, I might just do that."
You sure you don't want to split the blame?
- Positive.
- OK.
I'll see you in 50 years.
"I can smell you out there, young lady."
You are beyond grounded!
"Open this door, Maddy."
Open the door!
"You and Rhydian gave Tom and Shannon, a picture of you in wolf-form!"
What were you thinking?
"In some parts of America, wolves are protected."
I'm going to get our wolves protected too.
"If you want the Government to start passing laws to protect them, you need..."
- proof they actually do exist.
- I've got it!
"Kelton, do you read me?"
Do you read me?
"Kelton, answer me."
"Kelton, talk to me now."
Come on!
This is Alpha.
I'm okay.
Search and Rescue's traveling.
Monroe!
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
I've got my location.
Look for a manhole cover...
It's number... nine...
It's number 929.
That Nathan card wasn't a coincidence.
That perp knew I was going to be on this case.
You think he has an ax to grind?
I don't know.
I cross-referenced the word Nathan with the number 929.
II Chronicles 9:29 talks about the prophet Nathan.
"Nathan passage, Nathan card..."
"Why it's relevant, I have no idea."
Perp could be a religious fanatic.
What's his profil say?
His taste is consistent.
"Both Sara and Amanda are attractive, civic-minded politicians' wives."
"High profile, soft target."
How hard did they look at Amanda's husband Curtis McNeal?
"With a fine-tooth comb, even though he was mayor at the time."
There were rumors of an affair.
He took a lot of heat from the local press.
Nothing stuck.
A meeting?
We're isolated because of Han and Puyo's embargo.
And Puyo's preparing to attack us.
I want to ask Commander Jumong what he plans to do about this.
Call the Commander.
You can't talk to him now.
Why not?
"Is he really dead, like the people say?"
What are you talking about?
The Commander isn't dead.
Even Sosuhno has disappeared.
Yuntabal.
Tell us what's going on.
Where's the Commander?
I can't tell you.
I can't trust you until I meet him.
He's the one who failed to protect us against Puyo and the Han.
We'll take matters into our own hands.
Let's go.
I'll talk to Songyang before attacking Jolbon.
He'll want to avoid a war once he finds out Jumong is dead.
We'll be ready to attack as soon as you return.
?
?
Dante!
Dante!
I've gotta rest.
"I told you, you shouldn't have done that last hit, man."
You've been doing too much lately.
"You're not doing enough, friend."
I love the venom and the sweet venom loves me.
Ha haahah!
"What's High School Musical 1 and-- dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!"
"Yeah, where the hell have you guys been?"
Peru.
"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there..."
Bridon Gueermo.
"Bridon Gueermo-- oh, he's such a dream!"
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo.
"But he'd never go for me, I'm nobody."
"That's not true, Red."
Everyone has something that makes them unique.
# Everyone is special #
# In their own way #
# Move to the beat and let your spirit out #
# As long as we've got each other #
# We'll never have any trouble #
# That's what bein' friends is about #
# Oh yeah #
# Everyone is special #
# In their own way #
# And we'll always be together as one... #
What the hell are they doing?
I have no idea.
#... together we'll stay #
# And every kidin school #
# Is special in their own way #
"Dude, girls are such fags."
"# Oh yeah, oh yeah #"
# Boys #
# Are special in their own way #
# Girls #
# Are special like a birthday #
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha.
Ask anyone!
"Okay, then."
Why don't we start by asking...
your conscience!
Aah!
"Uh, now who's cheatin'?"
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man, that was an accident."
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that!
- Is it?
"Okay, okay."
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
"And apparently, it knows my name!"
"Right, so, I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders."
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, my lady."
(TINKLING)
I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
"So, which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?"
"Go on, fight it out."
"And don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
(CAR HORNS IN THE DISTANCE)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
(CAR HORN HONKS)
(DOOR SQUEAKS)
(CLANKS)
(ENGINE STARTS)
- Impressive.
- (GASPS)
"But really, you could've just asked me for the keys."
Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery is in progress.
Emma Swan.
Good name.
"So, do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
Excuse me?
"- Hey, eyes on the road!"
This is a dream come true.
That's very kind of you to say.
"Our society has a long and rich history, and our membership expands every continent, save Antarctica."
Not too many murders there.
No.
No. [Chuckles]
"Although, I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship hidden in an iceberg... 2007."
"Now, I hate to do this, but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone."
"I'm sure you understand, Ms. Shipton."
No.
"I can stay here, if that's what you mean."
Excellent.
This way.
Ooh.
"As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members."
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I know you.
You were at the crime scene.
You're a cop.
"No, but I wear the hell out of a uniform."
This is Kendall Frost.
She's a private detective based out of San Francisco.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused.
What exactly are we doing here?
Phillip Harris was a member of our society.
His death is a tragedy.
But it is also an opportunity for you or Ms. Frost.
Phillip's death has left an opening in our ranks.
Elimelech.
Who was that?
Boaz... a kinsman of mine...
just wanted to say goodbye.
and their two sons left their home in Bethlehem.
they arrived in the land of Moab where they found relief from the famine.
Elimelech died.
Naomi's two sons grew older and eventually married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth.
they knew very little of the God of Israel:
The God of Naomi and her sons.
and Naomi loved them very much.
tragedy struck again.
Naomi's two sons also took ill and died.
Now three widows faced the future alone... together. and I want you to go back to your families.
What?
Mother?
do it for me.
but we can't let you live alone.
Bethlehem is no place for two Moabite women.
My people will not accept you.
You'll be strangers there.
As you were a stranger here.
Don't you understand?
It's my fault that you've been hurt.
The Lord has punished me.
That's not true.
Your God is good.
You are good.
you'll do as I have asked.
Go.
Return to your own people.
I will go;
"Hyang Gi, get a bit closer."
"Smile, smile!"
Okay!
"All right, one, two..."
Wait!
Really...
"Hey, move your breasts up a bit, like this."
Mom!
"Wedding photos are like your honeymoon, you only get it once."
"Mom, you're not a professional, leave it up to the pros!"
You're being completely rude!
"Rudeness is momentary, pictures are forever."
"It's fine, right Mr. Choi?"
"Yes, are you ready now?"
"The kids are going to get tired, stop it."
"Ahjumma, please take my mom to a cafe or something."
We won't even get one good photo because of mom.
What?
We're going to be spending the entire night like this.
And my feet hurt.
You think you'll get anything with no suffering?
Endure it!
You think I'm doing this because I have an excess of strength?
Let's go.
"Let's go and drink some tea, and get some fresh air."
There's no need for us to be here.
Are you the only one whose feet hurt?
You think I like doing this?
Ma'am!
"I'm sorry, Oppa."
Let's start.
All right.
"- Yeah, but you're not looking at me."
That's 'cause I don't wanna see your silly grin while you pitch.
"Now, continue."
"Look, Teague has breakaway speed to spare and durability."
"( chuckles ) Now, that is one lethal combination."
Lethal?
That is an interesting choice of words when describing Kisan Teague.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think he's a good person?
A good person?
I believe he can be.
"Besides, who are we to judge?"
We all sin.
"I'll answer for you, Charles."
"He can be a good person, but he chooses not to be."
How's Kisan any different than dealing with Sutton or Jared?
"We don't need any more distractions, Charles."
- We need a title.
"- And Teague can help us get there, sir."
- I really believe that.
"- The answer is no, Charles."
"But it was a very impassioned pitch, so je vous remercie."
"Means ""thank you"" in French."
- ( intercom beeps )
- Woman:
Jason Antolotti on one.
- ( beeps )
"- Good morning, Jason."
I'm here with Charles Greane.
"Larry, Chuck, let's talk Teague."
"- Way ahead of you, J. Been trying to..."
"- Go on, Jason."
"A good soldier should forget his past, and realize that he might not have a future, because he fights every day as though it were his last."
"Really, Alonso, when it comes to inspiring people you are one of a kind."
Come on.
I dont understand.
The place where we they're meeting us is...
It's two blocks from here.
"Also, coincidentally, they're meeting us in my neighborhood."
"Please, can you give me something?"
It's to eat.
Yes.
Here you are.
Thank you.
I've never seen such poverty.
The War had just ended.
People were hungry and there wasn't much food.
just what they got with their ration card.
My grandfather told me.
How everything has changed.
Hey.
I could swear that's you.
When I left home yesterday it was half-painted.
It was going to go in the sitting room.
Should we go in and ask?
No.
We have a mission to complete.
(WHISPERS) He's late for the Angelus.
Here.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
-Is Lola working with the Nazis?
Impossible.
She is saving lives and risking her own.
- We've got the guy who killed him.
- A cop killed my father!
- Kesser doesn't have the brains.
- He was convicted in court...
- Answer me!
- I'm telling you!
Your father is dead and this case is closed!
"If you can't accept that, that's your problem."
I can take that gun and that badge away from you right now.
- Is that what you want?
"- Do what you got to do, Nick."
"Hardy, we're out of our patrol zone."
Will you tell me where we're going?
We're going to visit a friend.
I'll break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right...
I'll just stay here and watch the boat.
- Can I get you something?
"- Yeah, a guy named Chicanis."
I don't think I've seen him all night.
"Okay, tell me what you know!"
Who told you to lie?
- Give me the names.
- Don't shoot me.
"- Hardy, put up your gun."
- Now!
"No, put up your gun."
"Hardy, damn it!"
This shit has got to stop.
If you have a drinking problem...
You were out of control.
Ok.
I'll have Sgt. Whitfield search the Zumwalt house for a similar hourglass.
It's Hotch.
Ellie Zumwalt is out of surgery and awake.
Thank you.
"We appreciate you talking to us, Mrs. Zumwalt."
We know this is a difficult time.
"My husband is dead, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
We're very sorry.
What about Josie?
Is my daughter all right?
We're hopeful.
That's why it's important that you tell us everything you can about what happened.
"I was asleep, and then there was a scream."
It was Josie.
"I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open."
Josie kept screaming.
"And every time I went to where I thought she was, the scream came from somewhere else."
"We realize you couldn't see well, but could you make out any features about this man?"
No.
He--he wore something on his face.
"They were like, um,"
"I don't know, glasses."
Like eyeglasses?
"No, no."
Bigger than that.
"More like, um, like goggles."
That's all I could make out.
Did he speak?
Only at the end.
Eleven.

That's why I want to get the 240 - better power-to-weight ratio.

What?

"How deep is it, mate?"
"Come on, Greg."
"Yeah, I'm getting there."
"Come on, Greg."
"- Not yakuza, are you?"
- I'm sorry.
I hand out flyers.
So you're a loser.
"I was a real estate broker, but I didn't accept voluntary retirement, so they tried to force me to quit by making me hand out 2,000 flyers a day."
I don't care.
"When I did that, they made me do 3,000."
They know it's impossible.
"They want to make me quit, and I want to quit."
But my kid's still in high school.
I need to send him to college.
Then stay away from drugs.
Some people kill themselves.
If you won't use drugs...
I'll stay.
I hope you cheer up.
Thanks.
Can I see you again?
Were you okay?
You're kind.
I fell bad for him.
Dangerous work.
"Yours, too."
Not like I want to do this.
I wanna work front desk at a top hotel.
"I actually want to open my own boutique store, too."
Thanks.
Take care.
"Hey, no, no, no!"
Can't I just have one?
I always wanted to eat all the nuggets myself.
All the nuggets?
Stop it!
"Just stop it, for God's sake."
What's wrong with you?
"- What, what?"
- I get it.
Everybody's found their special someone
- except for this old coot.
"- No, Mags..."
"You guys can't get your hands off each other, and that's nasty."
And you guys can't get your hands on each other.
"Well, just get it over with and do it."
At least you're not all by yourself in your home alone.
"Well, that's it, Mags."
You got the movie.
- I got... got what?
- You just guessed the movie.
"""Home Alone,"" that was the movie."
- What?
"- Yeah, you won."
"Why didn't you guys just go ""ahh""?"
It's the poster.
♪ ♪
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, those apps still have some life in them."
- They're cream cheese.
- It doesn't keep.
"Mags, what is going on?"
Do you still have feelings for Bruce?
"No, of course not."
"Well, then are you in love with Cookie?"
'Cause I would understand that.
"I don't know, I'm just..."
"I'm standing there looking at you guys, and it just feels like everyone..."
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me, Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handle Jeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
And it'll just be really great to be back in my old room again.
"Don't worry, Jenny."
We'll- we'll find a place for you.
"Well, that's great,"
"Because I'm moving in, too."
Downstairs.
I was waiting to tell you
Until the board approved my sublet tomorrow.
But I'm very excited.
All my family together under one roof again.
"Better watch out, Humphreys."
"They say love makes a family, but on the Upper East Side,"
Everyone knows it's real estate.
"Hey, dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late."
Can you save me a waffle?
Always.
I'll put one in the oven for you.
"Uh, how's Lily?"
She's great.
And you?
How you holding up?
"I mean, it must be weird."
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.
It was at first.
"But the fact is,"
He's just her doctor now.
I'm her husband.
"Uh, by the way, Vanessa can't make it."
Said she had to be somewhere.
"Oh, right."
"The, um, internship at CNN."
They called me as one of the references she listed.
"- Yes, she does."
"- Bite me, asshole."
You have a bad attitude when you're drinking.
"You have a bad attitude when you're drinking, you huge-footed slut."
You know what?
"I'm just gonna go get more wasted, and then I'm gonna bang some rim, dude."
Really?
Could it be this guy?
"No, it can't, but it could be Dennis."
Pass.
Whatever.
You know what?
I'm gonna take this.
"I'm gonna take this, and I'll see you assholes later."
- That is my notebook.
- Free coffee for a year.
Wait a second.
Where did she get my note?
- You know what?
I have backups.
- What is with her?
Something about drinking.
She just won't stop talking about it.
"- What, the plates of shit?"
- Somebody pooped the bed.
Whatever.
Let's get out of here.
We could use a fresh set of eyes on this if you don't mind.
"No, thank you."
"I think that Artemis and I have much better things to do, thank you."
"Actually, I'm just gonna stick around."
Excuse me?
Okay ?
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it!
You...have no clue...
Just leave me alone.
I don't ever want to hear from you again.
Wake me up when the latch turns.
But what if ...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze ."
But...
Just keep a lookout while I go dream about a dress.
Him
"Oh my God, is that the guy?"
What's going on ?
I don't know !
Why didn't he take our guns ?
I don't know !
Should we wake him or just pop him ?
"I don't know, Daze ."
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
Do you know why we're here ?
"Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there must be some sort of misunderstanding.
"We're not here to clean your bathtub, or organise your closets or make you happy."
Really?
Yea.
We are here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I've a word with my partner ?
Wait a second.
"Search him, Daze."
- you know i love you.
- that's not what i asked you.
"- well, you're my mama."
and that's all that matters.
"- but you know i love you, right?"
- i know that you've got your own way of showing it.
are you okay?
- [sighs] i got some things to figure out.
- [sighs] harley.
"i love you very, very much, all right?"
but i need you to go back to bed now.
"- mama, if you need anything, i'm here."
"and i will do anything for you, mama."
you know that. right?
"- i do know that, and that's what worries me."
come here.
"now you get on back to bed, 'cause tomorrow is christmas."
"- but, mama."
- go on.

- good night.
- good night.
[sighs]
[door creaks]
"[car door closes, engine turns over]"
[dialing]
"- ho, ho, ho."
"you've reached bob, marjorie, and tim."
"we're at the outlet mall, shopping for your christmas presents, so we can't take your call right now, but we sure do want to talk to you."
leave a message at the sound of the beep.
[beep]
"- hi, uncle bob."
officer david.
This is jody carvell.
I am standing outside of the larson lane house.
Are you aware that the police tape is still up?
"Yes,it's an ongoing investigation."
It's the real-eate agent.
"Okay,for how much longer?"
It costs me money every day I can't show this house.
- This is outrageous.
"- Yes,but I..."
"- no,I..."
"- I would like to speak to your pervisor,if I could."
She wants to have a word with my survisor.
"miss kemp,it's is."
We need to speak with you agN.
Rebecca?
"Rebecca,what happened?"
Did you call 911?
Hold on.
"Yes,I've got a woman here who's shot and needs immediate medical attention."
why would someone unbury a body?
I can answer that.
"To send a message.Like,""hi,I'm dead."""
"""Never get engaged to two women at the same time""?"
It would be easier to jusrent a billboard.
Second question.
where's the money?
"ah,maybe in siri's engagement ring."
I got to bring this down to abby.
I can save you an elevator trip.
"oh,that's nice."
It's creating condensation.
Yeah Sir?
"I am going to tease her, you beat me."
With hand or with leg?
With leg.
With left or with right leg?
Whatever just beat me!
Whatever just beat me!
"With both leg, or i will kill you i am going to tease her."
Coming?
My room or yours?
What?
"Hey listen, come!"
"Sorry, i am not that type of person."
Even i m not that type of women.
Don't you have brother or father?
"Why you are showing attitude, see its off season, i will give you 50°/° off."
The girl is teasing Papa.
Come...
someone help!
Come... someone help!
Okay whatever you say i will do.
"Okay whatever you will give me, i will take it."
You don't have manners you are teasing the person who is like your mother?
No... no...
he is not teasing me... beat me hard.
What are you doing he is my customer.
"Why you are not beating me, ., come-on do it."
"Leave him, he is my customer."
Why you are beating him?
He was teasing a women.
Women?
He was teasing a women!
Who's here to avoid it?
Step this way!
Aren't you...?
I have the safest way for you to avoid it!
"If I knew it could be avoided, I'd do it too."
It's already my 8th child!
"Better late than never, why not start now!"
Please come with me!
What a bunch of fools!
You couldn't even get those 2 jerks.
How can you be the Commissioner of Police?
How can you be the Sick Man of Asia?
"Your Excellency, cool down!"
I know the place of exchange:
Cafe Casablanca.
- You recognize me?
- No!
Really?
I don't know your kind of person!
Lucky me!
"I'm not in a good mood, just get lost!"
You think you can get away by not looking at me.
"You can tell from my voice I'm the Commissioner, scram!"
Upstart.
Nearly wouldn't give up his place!
Has Yoyo been today?
Damn...
Canton was defeated!
"""Long live China and our great national heroes."""
"""Long live China and our dauntless armies."""
"""Brothers never give in!"""
"""Yet yourselves ready, brothers, to fight on the front line!"""
"The soldiers met Snow White, is that right?"
"Yes, they met Snow White..."
"No, you are fooling me!"
Smart you!
"So, where did you stop?"
Why should I answer your question?
"Right, I don't know why you want to answer me!"
What a shame!
"Chan Mon-gut, you've gone too far!"
Wipe your sweat first!
I think you haven't had good sleep lately.
Does Ho Chun visit you every night?
Your Honour!
"Let's go back to our topic, what did you do that night?"
"I told you, I read at home."
"No, I don't mean the night Chun was killed."
I mean the night before he was killed.
"Before killing him, I went..."
Yes!
You're finished!
"Your Honour, I request to reach the final address."
Damn you!
Tell us what you did on the night before Chun's death.
Police.
No!
I mean Chan Mon-gut.
What's the matter?
The defence counsel's personal point of view is really amazing!
But according to the legal procedure...
Come on!
Why are you so stubborn?
You're charged with contempt of court.
in her job description?
Their job is to follow instructions.
So is yours.
You knew that I couldn't let this go.
"as it turns out, I was right."
I apologize for doubting you.
Oh.
"Well, thank--thank-- we're--we're all human."
As far as I know.
You know that this was only Macpherson's first move.
And he's planning something... bigger.
Any guesses what his plan might be?
No.
I don't know.
I don't want to wait to find out.
You know what the Talmud says?
"""If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."""
"It also says ""don't rush into any unnecessary danger."
"A miracle may not save you."""
Previously on Warehouse 13...
So you know it's MacPherson.
- I'm right.
"- Yes, I'm afraid you are."
And he now has a sword which renders him invisible.
Now it's up to you to stop him.
You always hurt the one you love.
"Okay, just stop."
"Okay, stop and think this through."
Guess what.
I'm still taking the artifact.
"I can't let you do that, Pete."
First of June.
"Xiaotian, will be graduated."
Don't catch a cold!
"Drink it, chicken soup."
Drink all of it!
I'm sorry!
This is all my fault!
It's all because of me!
Why do you cry again?
"Except cry, what else can I do?"
It's for you.
- For me?
"- Your 18th birthday gift, one week ahead."
"I'm afraid to see you cry, and I can't leave you."
"So I wrote this letter,"
I have to give up myself.
Please forgive me if I often lied to you.
Forgive my cruelty to have your baby aborted!
It's because I don't want you live in agony and remorse of youself.
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
"I knew that all these years, you have been treating me just like your brother."
I can never replace the position of Xiaotian... in your mind.
"However, I'm still willing to do anything for you!"
Willing to be there whenever you need me!
Willing to be someone most you trusted!
"So, Yawang."
"Don't say sorry for me, because..."
I love you!
"Judge,"
I have to accuse Qu Weiran of rape.
Yoon Jae...
You came...?
Surprise!
Why did you come here?
!
What were you thinking coming here?
!
I came here to see you and some lady just suddenly appeared!
'Guess what was inside the dumplings?
'
"'Wriggly, wriggle..."
Ah!
You guessed it!
'
She said that and just dragged me inside.
I'm about to go crazy!
You're lucky that I was able to figure out the situation so quickly.
"What would you have done if I said, 'Lady, who are you?"
'
"Since I was good enough to greet them all, you take care of the rest on your own."
Bye.
Where do you think you're going?
!
"If you started out as Yoon Jae, you have to finish it out as Yoon Jae before you leave."
Okay?
What?
Seeing how he came all the way here...
I guess the wedding isn't off.
He said he was like that because he's been unwell since being in a car accident.
We misunderstood over nothing when he was sick from the accident.
"Talk it over with Yoon Jae over a spicy dumpling stew and a drink, then let it go."
Choong Sik...
I need a lawyer!
I want my lawyer!
- Oh.
"- Don't shout, Richie."
It oscillates the atmos and rattles my phlegm.
- I've found you a lawyer.
- Oh.
Met him outside.
Known him for years.
Spurty.
"- Pervy Sir Peter Spurty, QC."
- Mm.
"Bit of luck him being here, really."
He'll get anyone off if you buy him a dirty mag.
Remember when the Tory cabinet were found in that brothel discussing declining moral values?
Clear as a bell.
Pervy Sir Peter Spurty got them off.
Right.
He's the man for us.
Bring us our lawyer!
We demand Pervy Sir Pete.
"- In there, Spurty."
"- Blimey, that was quick."
"Well done the police, say I."
Why do left-wingers keep sniping at them?
"If you don't wanna get beaten up, you shouldn't be poor."
"Richie, shut up."
"Watcha, Spurty."
"Me and my mate are in a bit of a fix and are gonna do five to ten in the slammer unless you can stitch the jury, rig the judge and buy off the pigs with a kickback."
Eddie.
"Please, please, please."
"This is England, Eddie."
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?
Just tell him!
It is 1969!
For frig's sake!
What it is...
That's not really a sentence.
Thank you for the photo.
No trouble.
"The other day, when I said I was going out with somebody,"
"I wasn't really, so, I don't know if you want to still go out with me."
"Well, I can't just decide on the spot."
I will have to think about it.
"No, of course."
Absolutely.
I've thought about it.
"Yes, I would and where shall we go?"
Oh.
You really want to?
You've no idea.
You have no idea.
Wow!
Crikey!
"I ordered sausage, egg and chips to cheer myself up."
I could send it back!
Could I hold your hand?
Yes.
Hang on!
Let's do this thing properly.
"So, none of my beeswax, but I am a man, so, obviously, a bit thick as regards these matters."
Were you going out with somebody or not?
"Well, I was seeing somebody."
"We didn't really go out, and I haven't actually told him yet."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating!
Five years ago misfortune struck me and I lost a child.
- But now you're already seven months pregnant.
- Just so!
This time I want to know for sure.
Doctors are just men and have no idea what goes on inside us.
Come on...
Bruno?
Why are you snooping around here?
"It smells so strange here, all the way out to the courtyard."
It's Lisol.
It smells healthy!
"No, it reeks..."
"like in hospital, as when mother had our baby."
Why are you mopping up here?
So that you have something to ask.
Here!
This is women's work.
Hah!
"Whenever you want something from me, I'm a lady to Mr Bruno!"
But when I want something from you...
What do you want from me?
Nothing at all!
It looks so different here.
I've fixed it up so I can sleep here.
Sleep?
Yes...
I'm not telling anyone...
"A real little room, something like that is what I've always wished for."
With a mirror...
"But to sleep here alone, Bruno..."
I would have been afraid to.
I should've been straight with him.
I should've stood by him.
"And we should've remembered the code that he taught us, 'cause without that code, we'd be... long gone right now."
Amen.
Which is why we're gonna do this job.
For Uncle Eddie.
We're gonna kill the son of a bitch who did this.
And then we're gonna rob him blind.
"Yeah, well, first things first."
- What?
- We're gonna do this... we get it all on the table.
Full disclosure.
You can't be a part of this crew unless you know everything.
"Go ahead, you two."
Show her what you really are.
- What?
!
[gasps] - [roaring] [people screaming]
- [moans] - [screaming continues]
[panting]
[Scott] Boss...
What are you doing?
Getting a taste for what's coming.
"Okay, I got the bonds, but she's coming with us."
[chuckles]
Perfect timing.
You're about to see the rise of a new Lord.
"Go ahead, kid, knock yourself out."
You deserve it.
"- I'm sorry, I..."
- It's not your fault.
I don't know how he found me.
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
"I'd like to ask one, too."
"What is it, mr."
Collins?
How long will it take them boats to go from new york to bristol?
"Overnight, mr."
Collins.
Just overnight.
"Oh, excellent, excellent."
"Yes, well, just a moment, mr."
"Maybury, i'll have mr."
Fisk answer that question.
"Oh, mr."
Fisk- mr.
Maybury would like to know if all 6 of the new boats will be taken from this model.
"Oh, of course not."
Each one is to be larger and more luxurious than its predecessor.
"Well, tell mr."
Maybury i'll come in and explain the details myself.
Thank you.
"Oh, would you mind coming back a little later?"
"Oh, i don't mind waiting."
Patience is its own reward.
Make yourself at home.
"It seems to me, mr."
"Palmer, that nothing, nothing can be too fine for our clientele."
I?
s working.
"Gentlemen, i think we'd better close this transom."
The enemy is right here in our camp.
He's nibbling.
"Let me take a peek, jim."
He don't look like no big fish to be- he looks more like a sidewinder crab!
Why are you so uncomfortable?
It's like you're somewhere else.
What is it?
"If there's a problem, I'll take care of it here immediately, so just tell me."
Is someone making problems for you or can you not pay the bills?
Dad!
"No, there's nothing wrong."
Why are you getting on his case?
This isn't the first or second time you've seen him.
"This isn't the first or second time, but it was bothering me."
It's so easy to bother you.
That's nice.
"I can't see your eyes, I can't see your third or fourth eye behind that."
- All right then.
- Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
"- Don't be late, it's at seven."
"I won't be late, I won't be late."
Good bye.
Seat him at another table tomorrow.
Ahjussi!
We should go too.
"Right, go, go."
You displeased me today.
Yes.
"Mom, stop it."
"- Bye, Ahjumma."
- All right.
I'll leave oppa in your care.
Don't worry.
"I'll call you, Oppa."
How were you going to act?
He says it's your lucky day.
He says it's your lucky day.
"Mr Adams, Don Mackay speaking."
"Mr Adams, Don Mackay speaking."
G'day.
Guess who just won the Golden Casket?
G'day.
Guess who just won the Golden Casket?
Wow!
I'm always happy to speak to a lottery winner.
Wow!
I'm always happy to speak to a lottery winner.
Uh...congratulations.
Thanks.
Uh...congratulations.
Thanks.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
That's very generous of you.
That's very generous of you.
What sort of things does your daughter-in-law like?
What sort of things does your daughter-in-law like?
The most expensive.
What else?
The most expensive.
What else?
"I tell you what,"
"I tell you what, why don't you drive to Jerilderie?"
why don't you drive to Jerilderie?
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
"Well, that sounds like an offer I can't refuse."
Thank you.
"So, what, you're just never gonna have sex again?"
Probably not.
It's funny.
"You know, I never had a problem screwing in a bed where another guy's been."
You've never had a problem screwing in a woman where another guy's been.
You told him you were dangerous?
You're so non-dangerous.
I know!
"But I swear, with him, I feel like I could be."
Mm-hmm.
There's something about him that's so dynamic.
This confidence...
I have not felt this excited about work in I don't know how long.
Dear God... exhale.
Oh.
Oh!
And let me tell you... is that boy easy on the eyes.
Don't.
I know... don't do voices.
Thank you.
"Seriously, he is hot."
"Obviously, I would never go there."
Please.
You keep an apartment there.
Nope.
Not gonna happen.
"I'm happy just to be around him, to work with him, to learn from him."
He is amazing.
"I hear myself talking to these people, and..."
They're listening to me.
"I mean, really listening and nodding."
"No matter what, she doesn't make it out alive."
You know a lot about this business.
What's the problem?
What do you care?
Like you haven't done it a hundred times before.
We've almost drilled through your door anyways.
Might as well save your own life.
What's she worth to you?
She's nobody.
Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
I couldn't take the shot.
I couldn't do it.
How could I do it?
He said he couldn't take the shot.
"- No, he couldn't."
"- What does that mean, Emerson?"
What do you think it means?
It means that there are no other safety measures.
That David was the safety measure.
Yeah.
Means that you're the safety measure.
And all this time I thought you were protecting me.
I knew you looked at me funny.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
- I'm stuck here with you.
- Yeah.
Back to business.
"Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?"
"He's good-looking, but not into himself, smart, but not a showoff."
"Athletic, but sensitive."
A politician's son.
"Hey, he's like Newport's Prince William."
"- Yeah, the kind of guy parents love."
"- Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is that I'm dating a congressman's son?"
"- He is, like, dying to go have lunch with Zach."
"- So, you going to do it?"
No way.
Remember what a Grade A disaster that was with Cohen?
"- Yeah, but Zach's not Seth."
"- Believe me, I know."
"- So, then what's the problem?"
You afraid he might actually like Zach?
Then you two will live happily ever after with no problems and nothing standing in your way?
- No.
I... no.
"- Oh, so, then you're not over Seth."
"Oh, I am."
I've divested myself of all of Seth's material possessions.
I'm vibrating at an extremely Cohenless frequency.
"- Okay, so, then you don't really like Zach."
- No.
I mean yes.
I don't...
"Ew, shut up."
"Hey, Summer."
Marissa.
Hey.
Come sit down.
When you..
"- When you look at the coating, will you beat that guy up on the price?"
Kevin!
That is not a real toilet.
"Dad, what's going on?"
Is everything okay?
Please tell me he's not peeing in the store.
It's nice to take a moment and just relax.
Dad?
I gotta go.
I don't know him and there's no way I'm going near him.
"Grandpa, there's no toilet paper."
Help me get my shirt off.
"You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp."
They want you to be in debt.
That's how it works.
"They give you these credit cards you can't pay for,"
"HD, motorcycles."
It's all a pimp game.
I BELIEVE IN ANGELS

No blessing.
I'm not giving my blessing.
Where would she go without a blessing?
"Shut up, woman."
"A fine job you did, raising her."
What I've been telling you?
It's like he was a figment of my imagination.
PHILIP:
I'm fairly certain I'm not welcome here.
Ding-ding-ding.
It's late.
I've been sitting here waiting to make a scene for hours.
What do you want?
I'm very lonely.
That's unfortunate.
I don't like teaching creative writing as much as I assumed I would.
"Well, you're a cruel, miserable person, so it makes sense you'd end up in a miserable situation."
What happened to my desk?
That's my bonus desk.
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.
I think I might resign and come home.
(MUMBLING) You don't live here.
You live upstate.
"No, I don't want that to be my home."
It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.
Boo-hoo!
The last few weeks have been so hard for you.
Whose cat is this?
It's my cat.
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.
"Oh, look, see?"
There it is.
"Come here, big boy."
This is Gadzookey.
"Gadzookey, meet Philip."
Don't get attached.
"Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up."
"I'll take her, Jake."
Yeah?
"Thanks, Peyton."
Glad to.
"Alright, gather around."
Where's Nathan?
"Tim, you're his girlfriend, where is he?"
"I don't know, coach."
He was at school today.
Alright.
I've got some offensive sets worked out here.
Line up at the low stacks.
So I had an idea.
Okay.
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?
Steinbeck.
"Yeah, that guy."
And then you did something that I wanted.
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?"
But in a fun way.
I'm thinking we should try that again.
"Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first."
"Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you."
And I want you to know... almost everything about me.
"- What's going on, Brooke?"
- Nothing.
I just...
"I want to know you better, Luke."
"So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along, and then we trade."
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?
I only asked.
This is an outrage.
I'm warning you.
I have powerful friends in London.
You'll hear more of this.
[Door shuts]
[Door opens]
You're going through a lady's room.
No gentleman would behave this way.
"No, you're right."
"But then again, murder isn't a very gentlemanly business, miss harwood."
I can't imagine what you hope to find.
"It seems on the night of the murder, you left the room before the shots were fired."
Who told you that?
I have nothing to hide.
"I hate the dark, I always have."
It's like claustrophobia.
"As soon as the lights went out, I had to get back here."
In the dark?
I told you.
I wasn't thinking.
I just had to get out.
Just a minute.
"Foyle, is this the way your men amuse themselves?"
I've had enough of this.
I'm not gonna be pushed around by some bloody stuffed shirt.
I want to leave.
"Still not possible, I'm afraid."
Fleming:
"I said, I want to go!"
"Officer, arrest this man."
Thank you.
"Baby,I'm sorry."
"Oh,my God!"
Happy birthday.
"This is like some kind of,like,nightmare or something."
Happy birthday.
"No,happy birthday."
No.
You know what?
"Forget it,man."
Hit the road.
"No,no,no,we suld,like,celebrate or something."
No.
I'm in the middle of a gig here.
Okay?
That's right.
Gigging right now.
Bella!
Bella!
Really?
You are gonna hitch your hope wagon to Johnny Tearducts?
There are higher forces at work here.
I'm just trying to avoid dying alone.
He wasn't a bad guy.
So he's a little passionate.
Whatever.
Didn't he try to suck your blood?
Drink my blood.
Like in a nice way.
I was just going to check out his show and see what happens.
I'm going to tell you exactly what's going to happen.
"You're going to go; he's going to sing a couple songs about rainbows,get a little misty and then you're going to be right back here telling me how you're afraid that your lady parts have closed up."
Oh!
So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
From your Valentine's bitch.
PS:
"And on my face."""
"That's my favourite, I like the way she remembered the face."
It's funny how all these cards seem to be in the same handwriting.
Your admirers are either very young or have severe learning difficulties.
Which is possible.
The handwriting's bad cos they were strumming one out as they wrote 'em.
Not you writing with your left hand?
You're just jealous cos I got loads and you got none.
- I got a card.
- If it's your nan it doesn't count.
- I didn't get any then.
- I did get a card.
A proper one.
- Total bollocks.
I was thinking of an annual donation of one million dollars for four years.
But I need more time to think through   which projects I want to get involved with.
So don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay...
I was given a different impression.
"Then let's look at the papers again, because..."
"No, no."
Let's forget the boring paperwork until Monday.
We'll have lunch and I'll let you know what I've decided.
- I've got a busy weekend coming up.
- So I've heard.
I spoke to the guy that drove me here.
He's marrying your daughter?
"- Yes, Christian."
You're not married?
- No.
- Got any family here?
"- No, I don't."
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.
It's a huge wedding.
I don't know half of the guests myself.
- It would be nice.
- I need to...
You don't have any other plans.
We're through.
See you tomorrow?
We're looking forward to it.
- Then I can get to know you.
- Thanks for your time.
"- Hey, dad!"
- How are you?
Were you jumping on the trampoline?
Danny's been moping around all day.
"Oh, please."
"Come on, they're grown men."
Not like they're moping around the streets like some Backstreet Boys video from the '90s.
"Let's do this, you oily donkey."
You're not wearing your diamond stud.
No.
I just wear this for fun.
"I'm off duty, babe."
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Work the alley by yourself.
This is the alley where anything goes.
OK.
"Charlotte said, uh, Trent has the diamond at his apartment."
She wants to know if she should go sleep with him.
Excuse me.
What?
No.
- Tell her no.
- Finally I got to make out with Adam.
"That lunatic's back only if you go before... by the way, my legs..."
Nobody else hear that?
I'm all packed up.
"Going to head to the bar,"
Close early so we can all celebrate the engagement together.
You are still welcome if you want to come.
Nah.
I'm good.
All right.
"Well, if you, uh, if you change your mind, just, you know, come."
- What's wrong with you?
I have an infarct.
-An infarct?
-A ass infarct.
-A ass infarct?
-You are really vulgar.
It is an infarct ass.
-Its a joke.
You do not get upset.
"-No, clear that no."
If it passes a ass not it I can watch?
"We go, you make the peace."
-I do not want.
-It is truth what they say?
-What?
That you have chosen Medicine to study the birds.
Then it had to make Veterinary medicine?
no?
"Not them birds, ""love birds"","
Those that flies around the asses.
It is a old fashioned joke.
"We go, boys."
Prof. Cicchirini he is on the verge of arriving.
"You hear, you who you know everything to it, I can bathe if I have diarrhoea?"
"Yes, if you have much."
"We go, it is behind schedule."
I always have much.
"Italy, Italia."
"Land of saints, poets, navigators."
"You goes, never had said it to me."
"Good, I first do not try to be."
"You hear, Moroni, you cannot be here, if you sees Prof. him Ciotti, trouble is armed."
"It does not matter to me, I assume the risk."
"- Much better, Donna."
Thanks.
Listen I didn't thank you how I should have yesterday.
Going through all that with me at the hospital.
It's okay.
What'd your wife say when you told her what happened?
"Not too much, you know."
Did you talk with her about taking walks?
"Yeah, we may do that."
You didn't tell her.
I didn't want to worry her.
"Besides, it turned out to be nothing."
What happened yesterday wasn't nothing.
The doctor said I should take the treadmill test but he doesn't think there's a problem.
"What the doctor said was, you're under extreme stress, you need to relax and he suggests taking long walks after work."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, I'm okay."
I'm fine.
Thanks.
- Detective.
- Thanks.
My boss is leaving town.
He wants to hear your prep on the Ortiz testimony.
- He'll come here if necessary.
"- Yeah, all right."
Tomorrow at 2:00?
Tomorrow at 2.
Is Stan Heywood there?
"Stan, John Kelly."
I'm Robin's friend.
I got something for you.
Whenever you want me to drop it by.
"This one time, he didn't want to drink out of my latte."
Oh!
"We're doing a good thing, saving Lana from this scumbag."
"Yeah, but, which one of us is going to save her?"
Now I'm wondering if you're a racist.
"No, come on."
You know what?
"No, we can't do this."
Remember what happened the last time we competed over a girl?
"Okay, first, we need to go to a place that has money."
"Yeah, then we need to go to a place that has pants."
Yeah.
You know what?
You are absolutely right.
"From now on, we will only hit on girls whose boyfriends are not in the hospital."
Yeah.
Classy.
- Is Dr. Lonsdale coming?
"- No, he said you should handle it."
"Okay, well, that's, like, three babies."
That seems like plenty.
"They're quintuplets, doctor."
There's two more.
Are you (Bleep) Kidding me?
This has seen better days.
"Hey, sexy."
We got to talk.
Things are getting out of hand at work.
I delivered quintuplets.
I hope.
"I mean, I didn't really actually count them at the end."
Congratulations!
- into a POW camp.
- Why would he do that?
After what he's been through?
Maybe it's not so bad.
"- Yeah, how's that?"
- Now we have someone on the inside.
"If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot."
"But when we get them out, where do we hide them?"
I saw an abbey not far from here.
I'll go and make contact and see if they'll take them in.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- There was nothing you could have done.
About Alfred running?
About René.
Nothing any of us could have done.
So let yourself off the hook.
They got him.
Doesn't mean they're going to get Alfred.
Let's make sure they don't.
This was Eric's bunk.
- Are you American?
- Any news from England?
He's Canadian.
And he goes by Eric Darcy now.
What happened to Eric?
His heart gave out.
On work detail.
- How far are we into Europe?
- I'm sorry.
It's not going well.
There is no Western front.
I've got three kids.
Shut up.
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.
"Dawkins, you're surrounded."
Drop your weapon or we will fire.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon now.
Fire.
What the hell is this?
His mouth is glued shut.
This isn't Dawkins.
"Flight 106, arriving from Los Angeles, please proceed to baggage carousel number two."
Commander McGarrett?
"This is about my sister, isn't it?"
She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom which is a federal offense.
So we arrested her soon as she landed.
Great.
Jail?
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette.
"Okay, officer."
I think we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
- Let me check with my supervisor.
- Thank you.
"I'm sorry, I messed up."
"I missed you at dad's funeral, Mary."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
–I'm not lying!
"–Yes, you are!"
"Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act."
"–Without him, you're worthless."
Nothing.
–It's not like that!
And you won't leave him because you're afraid no one else will ever love you... that you'll learn Bob was right about you all along.
–No!
"–Oh, damn it, Marcy!"
–Don't lie to me!
–Why are you doing this?
Because there's a girl out there who may still be alive... and I won't let you kill her!
"Now, goddamn it!"
Tell me right now!
Where is she?
I don't know!
Really!
I don't!
I played the daddy.
I broke her.
"If she knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed... or at least given me a nondenial."
–You think?
–I don't know.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Maybe he's just an asshole.
"Problem is, he's the only asshole we've got."
"–Well, what do you got for me?"
–What you got for me?
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.
Fleetwood is fencing' again.
He's so goddamn predictable.
I...
I've lost my line.
Cut!
Twenty three takes!
I mean he stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War house wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
None of them thought to give him a bloody screen test?
Will Johnnie replace him?
This one has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
He is the tempered.
"If that empath young stays, the film fails, the national case with it."
He's a brave boy.
"With you, or I think so brave."
Is Mr.Baker alright?
He lost one of his grandsons
Oh!
Hit by a tram on shore leave.
Oh!
Must make it so much worse.
"If wasn't ""for"" anything."
Promise to Baker.
"This wasn't ""for"" anything."
Just think people like films.
Because story is a structure.
And...a shape.
Purpose and meaning.
One thing's turned bad.
"It's still part of a plan, you know, it's...it's...there's a point to it."
I like life.
"You don't believe in a match, do you?"
I believed this was gonna be a good picture.
- Do we need to chain it up?
"- Nah, this will do."
- Cool?
- Cool.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
"Please, okay?"
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it.
"You, have no clue."
Just...
leave me alone.
I don't ever wanna hear from you again.
"Wake me up, when the latch turns."
But what if...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze."
But...
Just keep a look out while I go in dream about the dress.
Oh my God!
Is that the guy?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Why didn't he take our guns or...?
- I don't know.
- Should we wake him up or just pop him?
We treat her in all possible ways.
But she'd better be taken to a hospital.
-Where is she?
- Overthere.
-Was it what you wanted to tell me?
-Yes.
Let's go.
"Oh, Lord."
Why are you keeping her here?
At this time everyone is hiding theiryoung maidens.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
"OK, I'll send Mikhail over."
Do you recognize this buffoon?
"Yes, it is the guywho used to dance around with an officer's cap on."
Do not shoot.
Let's playwith him.
Wait!
The onlything l do not need now is a bullet in my back.
What a bastard.
Can you imagine that I was shot at bythis sniper again.
He has made a hole in my vodka canister.
Not much of a marksman.
-But the remains ofthis vodka seem to be inside you.
- l hate losing such good things to the wind.
Do not breathe myway.
Wow!
"Well, some people are charmed against bullets and some -for luck."
Right?
"-Do not worry, Olya."
-What are you talking about?
It is a question oftime.
"We'll kill him, be it me or not."
"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
- She's going down.
- She's going down.
Don't touch her.
- Yeah?
"- Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly, but the crowd is drooling for you."
"Yep, floor is wet out here."
"- Okay, great."
Thank you.
- Tom James!
Tom James!
I'm gonna go rally the rally.
"With all due respect, you need to get your shit together now, lady."
Ma'am up.
You're still the leader of the free world.
Hmm?
Where's Tom?
"Oh, he's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally."
- What?
- The fuck he has.
Why would you let him do that?
"- Well, you don't work here."
"- Well, neither do you."
"All right, fuck all of you."
I'm going to the rally.
"Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented."
"No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent."
A tie is unprecedented.
So is becoming the first lady president.
So is that jackoff becoming president through the back door.
Okay?
The rule book's been torn up now and America is wiping its nasty ass with it.
"But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left."
Eric didn't know.
None of us do.
"You can play it safe, or take the chance and fight now."
These are some of the best men I've fought with.
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.
Our orders were to hold the line to the last man.
And we did.
It was a suicide mission.
I'm not putting these men through that again.
I'm sorry.
I can't let them take that risk.
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?
Damn.
You know what?
I missed lunch.
"So, do you mind if I...?"
If you're done?
Mmm.
Luftwaffe silver clasp.
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.
Yeah.
Gravy.
Why would I give information to an office boy?
Tell you what.
"I won't pretend to know anything about you, if you don't assume that you know me."
Don't usually flash that on a first date.
You ever been shot before?
No.
It's not much fun.
Come on with me.
"-ls that him there, kid?"
-No.
-How about him?
-Nope.
-That's the guy--
-Get him.
Excuse me.
-Scumbag.
"-Come here, you piece of shit."
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.
"From now on, any letter from that school to that kids house comes directly here."
You understand?
"If another letter from that school goes to that kid's house in the fuckin' oven you're gonna go, head first."
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No more letters from school.
"In fact, no more letters from anybody."
"Finally, after a couple of weeks, my mother had to go to the post office and complain."
How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?
"All right, make the call."
He used to get all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back from an outside phone.
[clicker clicks]
Kept me distracted.
Kept me from scratching my scars open.
♫♫ [woman singing opera]
Ahem.
That was my father's.
"Second War, paratrooper."
Dropped men behind the lines at night.
Can't talk.
Snipers.
So... [clicking]
Crickets.
Wow.
[chuckle]
I just want you to know that working on this case has been a gift.
Yes.
"I know that I stumbled at first, but I've grown."
I saw the video.
You surpassed all my expectations.
Thank you.
That' all I've ever wanted.
"To stand in front of a jury, wow them with my eloquence, and... it's all thanks to you."
No.
"And I want you to know that, no matter what happens in this case, it's not going to affect our feelings, is it?"
No.
W-Why do you keep shoving these fucking pictures at me?
"I mean, they do get a closer look."
You got to be really strong to do that.
I don't even know what that means.
When do I get my car back?
That's it?
That's all you got to say to me?
God damn it!
Is that your new waitress?
- You like her?
"You can have her, and give me Nora!"
I am not letting Nora go.
You can forget it!
Alright.
How's my money doing?
Still stuck to the wall.
"I'll stick you the wall too, my boy."
"I have a little time, and I have to show you this."
"Incidentally, I don't have any time."
You won't regret it.
"Listen, you just show up out of nowhere."
Couldn't you at least say please?
What's all this?
Why do you make everything so complicated?
Of course not then.
"I'm busy, goodbye."
Then at least stop singing.
"I have to get my show finished, you got that?"
Do you think you can just tell me what to do?
"Oh yeah, I think so."
"You're mistaken, my dear."
Put your lousy 10 Euros away.
I only take donations over a hundred.
I've thought about it.
In this case it's not a donation.
I would like something in return.
"What I want in return, is to touch you."
Go ahead.
What's going on here?
I mean television...
- What's all this?
"First of all, I think this place is great."
Really?
- Really.
"- Yeah, I think so too."
I mean it's exotic.
Right?
For example what's been done with money.
Pretty funny.
"- It's a hole in the wall, but it's alive."
- Perhaps it's best if Mr. Harmann and I sit down and consider what to do next.
"Coincidentally, my name is Harmann too."
"Yes, but coincidentally, she doesn't mean you."
"Alright then, good luck with that."
I'll be in my office.
"If anyone wants a coffee or something, just let me know."
Thanks.
Shit.
"I'm an idiot, I could be doing something completely different."
Like what?
Like earning money for instance.
Instead I'm sitting here in this shitty hotel with it's shitty rooms.
It's not shitty here.
You're beautiful.
Shut up!
I hope you like your new room and that you would recommend us to others.
We will do our best to ensure...
That's alright Tom.
- ... so that your stay is as pleasant as possible.
Yes I...
What should I say now?
He was a witness at the Chandler inquest.
"Maybe he wouldn't help, but you gotta start somewhere."
And he'd be fine.
"Mr. Louis Ord would be fine, just dandy."
"I felt like a fight, Father."
I felt like a fight.
"How many, sir?"
"You alone, f riend?"
I have a small table.
"The bar is good enough, thanks."
It looked like feeding time at the zoo.
All you needed was money to start with and bicarbonate of soda to finish.
- What'll it be?
- Rye and water.
- Plain water?
- Yeah.
"Here you are, sir."
"- Come here, sweetheart."
"- Yes, sir?"
Didn't you used to be a waiter here?
"Louis Ord, 45, single?"
"I seem to know your f ace, but the name--"
Remember a guy named Johnny?
"In this business you meet lots of Johnnies, sir."
You were a witness against this one.
He acted like a mine had gone off under his feet.
I hadn't seen a guy look that scared since jump training.
- Who are you?
- The name is Murdock.
- Capt. Murdock?
- How'd you know?
"- Johnny's told me about you, captain."
"Ah, the pirate thing."
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
"Let's see, you volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated."
You need to get back to a child.
"That's not perception, that's eavesdropping."
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
"Like I said, open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the Lost Boys."
And they all share the same look in their eyes.
The look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
Have you ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
- NEAL:
I think this little guy is hungry.
- (EMMA LAUGHS)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
I'm gonna get directions.
I will.
NEAL:
"Hey, man."
- OWNER:
How are you?
- I've been better.
They'll drive Sharon spare.
That's a weed there.
Look.
"She belched there, inside with the telly."
Kimberley asked her if she was gonna have the baby.
I don't know.
"It's hard to believe you can get so much shite... out of only one dog, isn't it?"
- Dessie?
- Huh?
Do you not think we should tell the girls... what Sharon did was wrong?
What?
I don't mean turn them against her or anything...
"Or the baby, remember."
"- Yes, I know that."
But...
- What?
I think we should tell them.
"Without, you know..."
I think we should tell them... that it's better to be married if you're pregnant.
"Jeez, they're a bit young, aren't they?"
"I mean, Lisa, maybe."
You'll need a shears for that.
What were you thinking of telling them?
Do you think we should?
"Whatever you think yourself, Kay."
I'm only their da.
They'll laugh at me.
Times have changed.
"Jesus, where did she leave her cop-on?"
Did she never hear of contraception?
Do you remember that crombie coat you used to have?
What?
Why don't you help us out?
Will you come?
I think I'd like that.
Fine.
"Good night, and thanks."
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?
"He asked when you'll marry Betty, before or during college."
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.
"Anderson's a good foreman, but Betty is something else."
"- Yeah, I agree."
- Then stop seeing her.
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.
- Uninvite her.
"- Now, Dad, I can't do that."
You're gonna.
Do you realize what it'd mean if you married the local tramp?
"When you marry, you'll marry someone on your own level."
Call and tell her it's off.
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.
"- Please, Dad."
"- Go on, call her!"
"1042W, please."
"I can understand you wanting to see this girl, but not in public."
You know what I mean.
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.
- Maybe he's bi.
- No one's bi.
Ever met a 70-year-old bisexual?
At some point you make a choice.
"Thus the expression, ""Bi now, gay later."""
- Maybe he hasn't decided.
- He better decide.
I can't keep missing work.
My hamstrings are killing me.
I don't know how I'm gonna make it up and down stairs at the Coliseum.
"It's Staples Center, dumb-ass."
Who knew too much sex could make you cranky?
- I wish I was cranky from too much sex.
- What are you and Joe up to tonight?
We are going to a club.
Yeah.
"This, um, band that Joe used to love."
- How very 20-something of you.
- We're in serious need of fun.
Last time I heard my husband laugh was with another mom.
Another mom?
Uh-oh.
Is someone feeling a little possessive?
"Oh, please."
She's hardly the issue.
"So, this club, do they let parents in or is it seniors' night?"
No.
"- Oh, definitely no."
- Come on now.
Hey.
- That is my favorite date dress.
- No wonder you're still single.
You want a piece a this?
!
I'll slap everyone in this Goddamn school if I have to!
You are never going to play shooty hoops!
Do you understand?
!
You are gonna sing and dance and be the best at it!
You're hurting my arm!
"Ah, shit."
"Oh, that's good, that's good."
"Yeah, shoot that guy in the face, Kyle."
"Yeah, nice."
You guys...this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away.
I think we better just get on-board with it.
What?
!
Are you crazy?
"No way, dude."
We promised each other we would never do that.
- Remember?
- Yeah!
"I know, but I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school."
We're losing all our credibility.
"I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now."
"Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake!"
What so bad about hanging out with me?
"Shut up, Scott Malkinson."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.
"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes."
Don't make fun of my diabetes.
I'm Scott Malkinson.
Wanna come with me and check out a real live architecture class?
(EX CLAIMS) Not even a little bit.
"You know, I'll just hang here with Marshall and Lily."
- It'll be fun.
- Fantastic.
- Okay.
"- Well, have a seat."
Relax.
"Yeah, this is casual."
"This is all very, very, very casual."
Listen to me.
You want me to find the perfect girl so we can all grow old together?
That is her.
"Do not let any guy near her, okay?"
"That means no waiter takes her order, no busboy clears her table."
"If she bursts into flames, I want a fire woman putting her out."
I don't think 911 takes requests.
"Damn it, Marshall!"
"Whatever you have to do, keep Maggie Wilks single until I get back."
I left my tab open.
Don't abuse it.
- Target secure?
- Target secure.
"- Oh, my gosh."
How weird.
- (MAGGIE LAUGHS)
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.
"Well, let's all walk back to the booth together."
(WOMEN CHUCKLING)
"(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, my."
"Look at this, the table where we are sitting."
Back off!
Why?
If the invalid eats one particular soup the maker's wish will come true.
Do you have a wish too?
"I have one, yes:"
to pass my exams.
I have another one too.
What is it?
I want Mrs Malek to get better.
- To get better?
- Yes.
Can you find us some milk for breakfast?
I don't have any cattle.
I'm alone.
Tell Farzad to fetch you some.
I don't understand...
"Ask the boy, he'll fetch you some."
"We're in the country, we'd like to consume local produce."
I don't have any.
I don't have any milk or cattle.
I have a lot of work.
Where are the people?
"Yesterday, walking around the village, I only saw children and old people."
The young men work the land.
They're farmers.
No one's idle here.
The old people and children stay in the village.
Where are the young people?
I just told you:
they're working the land.
The corn and barley are ready for harvesting.
The young people work for three months.
"In winter, they don't work."
Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working?
"I answered, ""lt's given up the ghost."" Do you remember?"
"That day, we were driving uphill."
The car gave up the ghost.
Yes.
It had worked too hard and gave up the ghost.
Yes.
What did I say?
"A car, just like men, can give up the ghost."
And I'll say it again now...
"Men, like machines, can give up the ghost."
Right?
You haven't worked this morning.
You're not tired.
"Yes, but... you know that's not always the case."
"Sometimes, when you're idle, you give up the ghost."
You understand?
You go crazy doing nothing.
You blow your top!
"All right, forget it, it's over."
Let's be friends again.
"Shake my hand. lf you can hear me, hold the line."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
I'll see you later.
"Come on, Behzad."
"Forget the cemetery, come and eat some strawberries..."
Hold the line.
I'm listening...
Hello.
He told you that?
Did you give him my message?
What's going on here anyway?
An old man was buried here yesterday.
"Last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up."
We've been looking everywhere for his head.
Sometimes I don't understand the world anymore.
How did you last this long?
My family.
"No matter what,"
"I went back home, and everything was okay."
Can I ask you something?
They say you found that hit-and-run driver.
"Yes, I found him."
"An insignificant state employee, living in a row house."
I went into his bedroom at night.
He was alone.
I woke him up.
I wanted him to knowwhy.
It was pathetic.
He cried like a baby.
I just couldn't do it.
Sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep.
He got married last year.
Has a daughter of his own.
"If somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death?"
I did.
I paid for it.
Now let's go afteryour Mr. Schoubya.
Mr. Schoubya.
Chief Inspector Minks.
"My colleague, Officer Schrader."
Thank you for seeing us at such shortnotice.
We have a few questions.
"I will just have to take my frustration out... on your good friend, Sam, who is working here."
"Okay, I'll do it."
What do you think of our new owner?
Pretty tough broad.
"But, uh, I guess she has to be."
She's a cooler.
Serious?
Told ya.
Maybe I'm not a cooler.
Well played.
Only one guy's left Acme recently- a Richie Tomczak.
"Uh, but it was for medical reasons."
"His doctor said that he had some bad disease, only had a couple months to live."
"What did I ask you for, a medical report or address?"
"Uh, yes, sir."
An address.
Mr. Tomczak?
Richie?
Hey.
Holy-
I guess your doctor was right.
What did you tell the cops?
What do you think I told them?
I told them the truth.
"I mean, pretty close."
"Actually, I told them, uh, I went there to talk to Richie... about some possible counterfeiting problem we had."
"Anyway, I told them the door was unlocked."
Sit down.
So they'll focus on the murder.
Right.
You think Tomczak was involved with the chip counterfeiting?
There's a pretty good chance.
This court is adjourned.
[chattering ]
"Nathan, get your father out of sight."
"All right, listen up."
I don't care what the judge says.
You can't murder a citizen of Eagle Bend and get away with it.
"So, by God, if they won't hang him, we'll do it for them."
You heard the judge.
Go home.
You stole my bullets.
"Now, careful, mister, we'll send them back."
stains:
Uh-huh.
It sure is easy to look tough...
... whenyouhaveloadedweapons and we don't.
"I guess you men wouldn't be interested in a fair fight, would you?"
"Well, I think we can manage a fair fight."
"-What do you say, boys?"
"-Oh, I love a fair fight."
[MEN grunting ]
[GUNSHOT]
Leave my boy alone.
"Sheriff, I could kill you right now."
"But truth be told, I don't want to."
"You want to kill me, but I ain't gonna kill you."
Because it ain't right.
You know that.
And I know that.
Justice has been done here today.
"Now, go home."
"Come on, get out of here."
Get on your horses.
"Grandma, I don't like it here"
If you and Arnav would like to live with your Daddy for a while... now that he has school holidays...?
Are you trying to send me away?
Like you sent Jai and Jagadish away?
I've no qualms about living with you.
I value your sense of integrity
"Om, I can put up with everything but I can't bear to see you sad"
"Papa, I'm ready"
"Papa, where are we going?"
To see Uncle Ramprasad
Uncle Ramprasad...
"- Ramprasad, it's me"
Stay back.
- Why don't you understand?
He knows me
The Minister for Culture has invited me to sing at his son's wedding
"Well, what brings you here?"
You know Shekhar and I...
Have split.
What next?
- I'm producing an album
And I want you to sing.
Who me...?
How Can I sing?
"You know, I'm on a 5-year contract with Shekhar."
I can't break that
But I gave you your break.
- I got a recording.
Can't talk much
"Nitu, it's only a matter of a while"
Are you bonkers?
Something like this?
How?
The edema affected her brain.
You understanding?
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, even talking to the radio."
You should have called me the minute it happened.
"Regular hospital not gonna put up with adema, so we give her a shot bring her here till the doctors, they fix up her leg."
Then we take her right out.
"2 or 3 months, she's out, good as new."
Miss...
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Are you a relative?
I'm her brother.
He's her son.
Just a minute.
[Woman sobbing]
"You know, it's funny..."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist now on park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of..."
"You go in, dimmie."
I wait for you outside.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
I'm so sorry...
"No, no, no."
Come along.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
"Father, I wanna talk."
Let me out.
We'll end the year with our usual nice profit.
We could triple our profits.
And we could go bankrupt.
So you won't even consider it?
"I'm afraid the answer is ""No. """
"But listen, John, if you'd just..."
Hello!
"Oh, did I interrupt anything?"
"No, no, my dear."
We've finished.
"How're you, Harold?"
"Hello, Mrs. Brown."
You didn't tell me you were coming into town today.
"Oh, I thought it'd be fun to pop in and surprise you."
You can take me to lunch.
I'm afraid I have an appointment.
If you'd have mentioned it this morning...
"Well, then it wouldn't have been a surprise."
I'm afraid I can't stand many more surprises today.
Maybe Harold will volunteer to take you to lunch.
"I'm sure Harold has his own plans, dear."
"Nothing important, Mrs. Brown."
I'd be happy to volunteer.
But you do have an appointment.
I'll change it.
It's no problem for a junior partner.
"Goodbye, dear."
"Hors d'oeuvre, madame?"
"Yes, please."
Oeufs a la russe?
Yes.
It must have been a girl.
"Look, leave that aside for the moment."
I shall deal with that first thing tomorrow.
I'll strike out into the icy wastes of the chilled dairy section.
I'll be like Captain Oates.
"Only, hopefully, I shall come back, but what I wanted to say, Enid, is,"
"I know this wasn't a date, but could it be?"
"Not this yoghurt blunderer's debacle, but could we go on a proper date?"
I'm going out with someone.
Oh.
So...
Right.
Sorry.
Doing my two short planks act.
I should have checked.
Sorry.
As you were.
Malcolm?
Yeah.
Did you manage to have a word with her?
No.
There's a lot going on.
We've got the dressage coming up.
"I mean, I will."
We might just have to tick along for a bit.
And don't keep bringing it up.
I've got enough on my plate.
I don't keep bringing it up.
"You said, once the girls had left school."
I can't just cut and run.
"Well, maybe I should cut and run."
Run where?
You're no spring chicken.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
"Doesn't that get an ""excuse me"" in return?"
"It's all right, Jake."
Some people just have better manners than others.
"That's okay, miss-- your husband's right."
My bad.
"Forget it, Jake."
It's Chinatown.
Your name's Jake-- you never heard that?
"All my life, Mr. Mulwray."
You okay?
Fine.
You didn't have to.
"No, I... kind of did."
Do we know that guy from somewhere?
There's something about him.
I've never seen him before.
Like... from our supermarket?
Maybe we go to the same dry cleaner?
"Well, while you keep guessing, why don't I go see if we can switch these seats, huh?"
All right.
All right.
Could we know him from work?
"All I know is, flight delays make nice people cranky and cranky people crankier."
"Well, he obviously falls under the latter category."
"...that's not how I do things, understand?"
Yeah.
Definitely the latter.
How do I know that guy?
"So, anyway, there I was, still trying to be cool on my second day at NSA."
It was my second day;
your third.
Right.
I see.
I tell you what.
Let's you and I discuss what I have to tell you first.
And then we can both interrogate Ward Fowler.
"You see, as Lieutenant Lucerne,"
I have a rather unpleasant idea taking shape in my mind.
Brandy?
"Thank you, sir."
"What might that be, sir?"
"Well, that might be..."
"And I'm speaking strictly as Lucerne, of course."
Of course.
"It just might be, unlikely as it may seem, it just might conceivably be"
Ward Fowler is the man we're after.
You mean the murderer?
Exactly.
No.
Yes.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
But let's think about it.
Let's examine the possibilities.
"Well, if you say so, sir, but I don't see where there could be possibly a motive."
Why would Ward Fowler wanna kill Claire Daley?
It's Claire Daley who made him famous.
That's what I was wondering and then
I got to thinking about the IOUs.
"Oh, did you, sir?"
Yes.
Oddly enough I did.
"I'm speaking as Lucerne, of course."
"Yes, of course."
Half a million dollars in IOUs.
See you.
Is there anything that you want to do before you go away?
No.
I don't think so.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven."
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
"Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation a but deliver us from evil."
Amen.
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Our Father, Who art in heaven..."
"Beto, give me a glass of water."
I'm very tired.
"Right away, madam."
I have a surprise for you.
The house is not sold.
"No, it's not that."
But don't worry.
Here's some money.
So you and another person can live comfortably.
I want to thank you for all these years you took care of the house.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
Lupe?
Can you come to the house?
Right now.
But come in through the back door because the driver is here and he might see you.
Yes.
Okay.
Hurry!
Here.
What loud?
Obnoxious?
Forceful. I'm Patty Chase.
- H i.
- Angela's mom?
Angela.
Rayanne talks about her all the time.
She's in love with her.
She wants to be Angela.
Really?
Gosh they seem so different.
You know kids.
They find one person and they just can't get enough of them.
Like being in love only they are not allowed to have sex.
Right.
"No, don't you remember there would be like this one person..."
"who had like perfect hair, or perfect breasts, or they were just so funny..."
and you just wanted to eat them up.
J ust live in their bed and just be them.
Like everybody else was in black and white and that person was in color.
Rayanne thinks Angela is in color.
Major color.
Thanks.
"So, how is Rayanne handling this whole incident?"
- She's great. I'm the basket case.
- Angela's just the same.
"'Who's going to shoot me with this body, Mom?"
' She says.
They think they're immortal.
And they have other things in mind.
Speaking of which Jordan is unbelievable.
Your daughter has complete taste.
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet, right?"
Afghanistan?
Maybe we crossed paths.
I don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...and me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'll see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.
I got this.
All right.
Here's the plan.
"On three, you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.
Then get behind that blast wall.
- I can do that.
"- No, he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.
His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,"
I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine.
Let's go.
"What's with you and God, anyway?"
"We know you love Miss Orthodox, does that mean you have to wear this costume for her?"
"Yes, but you wouldn't understand since you only love yourself."
- Witty!
- Did you find work?
"No, and please don't bug me about it."
Why don't you move back home?
"I swear to God, if you don't shut up..."
Don't take His name in vain!
Let's not waste time.
I have to open soon.
- Are we watching a movie?
- Patience.
Recognize this picture?
It's from when Morn took you to Paris.
So what?
We know the picture.
Look carefully.
See anything odd?
- Is this a quiz?
- Just play along.
Who took the picture?
"Aunt Rosa, of course."
This is from the same trip.
Aunt Rosa just had the eye surgery that she still talks about.
I don't think she went around taking pictures of you.
"Wow, Shai, James Bond has nothing on you."
She reminds me of Stevie Wonder-.
So who took this picture?
I don't remember a thing.
I was only five.
Look.
"Lower it very gently, lower it."
(Boards creaking)
Very nice.
Tie it off.
Tie it off.
"My God, that was heavy."
Good work.
I don't understand it.
"It took nine of us to lift it, we've taken two of the three coffin lids off, yet the whole thing still weighs a ton."
- Mummy must be made of lead.
- HOWARD:
Here's your answer.
The first two coffins were made of wood covered in gold foil.
The third coffin isn't wood.
It's solid gold.
And they said this might not be a royal tomb.
There is one thing that's bothering me.
Look at Harry's photographs.
The physiognomy of the second coffin is completely different from the other two.
Mace always said these shrines were botched up.
I think this one was made for someone else.
I think they buried our friend in a hurry.
"And I think it's time we had a look, don't you?"
HOWARD:
Ready?
Lift.
(Grunting)
"Pecky, tell me when you have it."
PECKY:
I'll take it now.
"Behind me, behind me, go behind me."
Behind me.
"Ah, yes, the last time you said that, you forgot."

You want to know where I'd be if I'd given up on my dreams?
"Living right down the road managing a Dress Barn, driving 400 miles in a ball gown to sing karaoke."
"I would not be the supermodel of the world that I am today, okay?"
Hello.

My marriage was a sham.
"I'm with Interpol, Serious Financial Crime Agency."
Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put on his yacht.
I see it in you now.
That look.
What look?
Revenge!
They were laundering money on a massive scale.
"You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead."
I found him.
I found John Brandeis.
Choosing a blind man?
That is the Constantine Clios touch.

"- Say thy prayers, go to bed before dusk, and no harm will come to thee."
"Ah, my poor Faith."
What a wretch am I to leave her.

Forget your past and become him entirely with every inch of your being.
Go.
Go.
"- Dearest heart, pray thee put off your journey till sunrise and sleep in your own bed tonight."
"- My love and Faith, of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee."
Bravo.
You're ready.
"Only three weeks in, and you're already a better Brown than Lucy ever was."
This will be greatest performance they've ever seen.
- Performance?
I don't understand.
"- Forgive me, Goodman."
"A momentary flight of fancy, nothing more."
Come.
You've been working all day in the field.
You deserve some rest.

"This way, we will forget each other."
I'll take him back whenever I want to.
Don't go!
I have to go after her.
Do you need to deal out pain in order to survive?
Even to a kid like that?
"She's not a kid, it's worse."
The worst must be me!
Want to bet?
"A proper little lady who would want the worst, is it able to suffer then?"
Is it trying to suffer?
Does one really suffer in theater?
You'll taste.
Feel.
I'll help you.
Come.

"If you pull out of me, you're finished."
Because of that?
That?

Good.
There I can't.
I spent my holidays here with my father and mother.
My father died in that room.
A bullet to the attic.
I'm lying again.
Woman's pump at 10:00.
"Oh, so how does it feel being the, uh... little guy?"
What's that?
Earthquake?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Blech!
"And now, for the moment of truth."
It fits!
The shakes worked.
"Hi, there."
I thought you might like to try our new flavors.
"Gaunt grape and lean, mean nectarine."
"Thanks, but I lost all the weight I had to."
I don't need any more shakes.
You really think so?
You guys must work on commission.

They're just like Grandma used to make.
"Well, not my grandma, but someone's grandma who knew how to bake."
Was she just about to tell me she loved me?
I'm so glad we came.
Blair£¬I need to talk to you.
Gossip girl knows.
Ominous.But ill-timed.
You can tell me tomorrow or never.
About new year's?
"Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip"
In exchange for keys to the kingdom.
I just thought you'd want to know.
If gossip girl were gonna post that information
She would have done it this morning.
"and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything."
"Blair, wake up."
You're not queen anymore.
You haven't been for a while.
And you're not going to be either
If you tell anyone what you know.
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.
You don't have what it takes.
You never did.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Bring me your leader.
It's not midnight.
My gossip's too juicy to wait.
I wanna talk.
I prefer to talk after.
What do you think about my coat?
I like it.
Why?
- And now?
- Even better.
I forgot to post the invites.
Dinner is served.

- Last few what at the old price?

- W--Worry about that when we get 'em inside!

"- We need a bigger window, you know."
-
- What for?
So we can write bigger letters.
I doubt if they can read that across the street.
All this m--money I'm spending on advertising!
I'm n--not r--r--reaching p--people.
All this money?
What money?
One little brush and a pot of whitewash!
"Do you want to cross the road, love?"
Off we go!
It's all clear.
"How about a kiss, then, to start the day right?"
"It might start your flaming' day right, but it won't do a lot for me!"
I see you've just met Dennis.
That's Dennis.
We're training him for a round of his own.
I hope it's not round here!
Thank God it's dark.
Suppose somebody had seen me kissing the milkman!
Some of these firms spend a lot of m--money on advertising.
That's it.
"If it's gonna cost money, that's us finished before we start!"
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
He's not here.
I hope nothing will happen to him.
-It doesn't look safe here.
"-Well, it's quiet instead."
"If I'm not wrong, it's such a sharp, frosty silence."
I would say even a dry silence.
Personally I'm more suited to the silence on Jupiter.
The silence there was so fizzy.
"-I'm not wrong, am I?"
-Yeah.
"On Jupiter it was fizzy, but sometimes deep and sublime."
"While on Ganimed the silence was kind of dark blue, lazy, blending together."
-Am I right?
Do you remember?
-Of course.
Only I don't remember what the silence blended together with.
With a morning cock-crow.
But on Oberon the silence there was something wicked.
-The nicest silence is on our planet.
-That's right.
Such a silence I haven't heard anywhere else yet.
The evenings in front of the bunker...
It's such a silence.
"Hallo, Doctor!"
Quiet!
You are in a reserved area.
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
She took what she needed from me to survive... until I perfected the serum.
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry.
She never fed on anyone after that?
No.
All right.
"Teyla, ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here."
"Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly."
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects,"
"If you bring her back alive, but I doubt she'll cooperate."
She's also stronger and faster than any wraith I've ever seen.
Great.
All this time... we thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us... and I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Addict's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you.
What do I do with the bones?
- Back there.
- Really?
"Yeah, the squirrels love 'em."
"Do you know that I lived in New York for most of my life, and I've never been to central park at night."
[Whistling]
[Indistinct chatter]
"How you doin', mama?"
- You goin' out?
- I ain't goin' out.
"If you wanna let someone come in, we can do some business, man."
What do I have to do?
"It's a hundred bucks, baby."
You don't ask questions... come on.
Cute.
[Heavy breathing]
There's this client of mine.
He likes to do young boys.
That's our specialty around here.
This one also wants to be done by a chick at the same time.
That's where you come in.
"Not me, man."
I don't get involved with chicken hawks.
I think you're pretty sick...
I'm goin'.
"Hey, this guy's a good customer of mine."
"I told him I'd get him a chick, cunt."
You ain't goin' nowhere.
"What's goin' on, here?"
I've been waitin' twenty minutes.
- Let me go!
"- Shut up, bitch!"
It tore her apart.
My father'll be happy now.
"""Not the girl."""
My mother and I were always telling him that.
But she turned out just like him.
Don't upset yourself.
What time is it?
It's been four hours.
THREE WEEKS LATER
You're going home?
Yes.
"I'd like to stay, but I can't."
You know there's nothing more we can do here.
Our bar's been closed for three weeks.
The kids are with a neighbor and I've neglected this man.
If anything should happen you can get here in two hours.
You can be sure of that.
We must have faith.
Faith?
"I keep lighting candles, but I'm finding it hard to have faith."
When can we put her medals back on?
Not yet.
"With all that she's got, the injuries, the tracheotomy..."
She never took them off.
- I'll get a vase.
- Thank you.
I have to go to America for three months.
My agent says it's important.
But...
The way things are here...
I don't want to go.
Can you go outside for a moment?
"I know, you're sensitive."
"Trust me, I get it."
"Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids then you can just stay over...?"
Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
The last thing I'd feel like doing.
If being in this wedding is too painful...
"Oh, God, you guys."
"Please, stop it."
"Relax, relax."
"That's enough, okay?"
"Seriously, you guys, I'm f..."
I've gone through breakups before.
"If you remember, I handle them quite well."
"You've been there, you've seen it."
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
BEN:
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.
"Well, that's okay."
You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
"A girl can dream, though."
You're just too good a guy.
[SIGHS]
Why are you married again?
[LAUGHS]
"Seriously, why?"
Hi...
"Oh, no, not again."
"Uh, I think it's an allergic reaction to something I ate, you know."
"Come on, come on, come on."
- My throat's starting to close up.
Oh!
- It sounds like you're dying.
"Rose, it's the third time this month."
Are you sure you're not allergic to me?
"Barry, please don't think that."
That's a terrible thing to think!
I'm gonna be blacklisted at every restaurant in Manhattan for not keeping reservations.
"Why don't you call me next week, okay?"
If you still want to.
- Sure.
Feel better.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Think I should start with a joke?
"Oh, you're serious?"
"No, I don't think so."
There's not enough time.
- For what?
- For you to develop a sense of humor.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the author of Absolute Truth,"
Columbia's very own Professor Gregory Larkin.
You're going to be fine.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'm honored by this warm and gracious welcome.
"As I stand here at the end of a journey,"
ADRIAN:
It's me.
I'm not going to be left out.
I'm not interested in you.
Where's Clementine?
What are you doing here?
Why shouldn't I be here?
I'm friends with all of you.
"Er...well, nothing now."
You know what he does to his victims.
He lures them off trains by gaining their trust.
"He gets them alone, kills them."
Lots of people kill.
What does he do specifically?
Er...
He takes them somewhere dark...underground.
It's strange.
They're such pretty girls yet he wants them in the dark.
Go on.
"He strangles them, he waits until they're dead and then rapes them."
What else does he do?
Tell me.
They wear perfume.
"He puts them in cellars, Anderson shelters, confined spaces, things like that."
The smell of it becomes almost unbearable.
"You know who he is, don't you?"
What I'm going to tell you goes no further.
- It's entirely confidential.
- Mm-hm.
"But if there have been 12 deaths, I think I must tell you."
"There was a man, he worked for me."
Good at his job.
"And one day, who knows?"
"All right, sir."
I'm sure the senator can handle Mr. Webster.
There is one concern we need to...
"Oh, right, concern."
Laine?
K told me about your little sexual romp in college.
Shit.
Tomorrow is the 17th.
- Glenda?
"- Yes, sir?"
Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday.
Have you got something for the son of a bitch?
"Yes, sir."
You got him a leather-bound Don Quixote.
"Oh, good."
Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.
He'll be trying to figure out why I got him that forever.
"Ah, were you married at the time?"
"Uh, I was a freshman in..."
"You know, sir, I'm just not going to comment on the whole thing."
It's beneath me and it's beneath the press.
That's the way to go.
Fuck the press.
Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell.
- It's perfect.
- Maybe I was too rough on Shelly in Hartford.
"Then this would all be moot, 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir."
You know what?
"Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team."
Who the fuck cares?
"You did her, and now you've come to see what it did to me?"
"- I love her out of pity, Mickey."
"- Don't you, by chance, pity me a little?"
- I love her out of sorrow.
"- Me, I love her out of full stop!"
- She respects you.
- Like one respects graveyards.
I'll never leave her to you.
It's to have you in her mitt that she took that mad flat just across from yours.
"Yes, you did your bit to waste the Venom."
But there's still three to go in her noble cause.
You up for it?
Now it's you she'll run away from.
Mickey isn't the brute you believe he is.
I don't have beliefs.
It...
It's tough to hurt you.
"For me to be able to kill you, you need to be a woman."
I'd wrap the blade in silk.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
No.
She would.
Buzz off!
Oh no!
"We are such children, prince."
Mary...
See?
- D'you suffer?
- D'you?
Our clients!
"Right on time, like for church!"
"Hey degenerate, you got Gothic mosques at home?"
"All I needed was a 2,000-watt generator, a test vehicle, and someone willing to risk their life for science."
You look great.
Look at this.
I have cameras all over the place ha-ha!
Really good.
"All right, so here's the plan..."
You're gonna be in the back of the truck.
"When I get a little low on juice,"
I want you to throw me the power cord right through the open top.
Perfect.
"- Charge it up, be good to go."
- Got it.
Who's driving the truck?
He is.
Oh.
That's why we got you the harness.
"I was pretty sure we were about to make history, continuing the American tradition of bold innovation."
"All right, Adam, here's what I want you to do..."
Throw me that football.
It's got a plug in there.
And I'll catch it.
We're just two kids playing football. [ Laughs ]
"All right, stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
Geez!
Wait up.
I can't catch up.
He only knows one speed.
[ Laughs ]
"Stig, slow down."
Too much!
"All right, we can do it."
"Thanks, Mike."
"Well, plus some of your other outstanding attributes."
Please.
Please!
Tell Miss Mancuso to talk to me.
This is Mike.
I'll be right down.
Two guys throwing' at Bella Petto.
"Look, man, read the sign."
"Read the freakin' sign, all right."
"Look, I am here."
"Get up, read the sign because-"
What is the problem?
That douche bag took a chair I reserved.
I left my magazine and sunblock on the table.
Only thing that reserves a chair is a towel.
"You don't know jack, pal."
"Sir, there are plenty of other lounges available."
"Okay, I get it."
"Uh, first of all, give it another 30 minutes."
There'll be 10 more just like her out here.
Trust me on this.
Looks like your brother from another mother beat you to it.
"So what you gonna do, hmm?"
"Relax, sit back and enjoy the Bella Petto experience."
"Believe me, there is nothing more important than asset management."
"And I mean that, really."
"Listen, why don't you- Why don't you call me?"
Okay?
Thanks.
All right.
You setting up shop here?
- I know.
- We should shootthe son of a bitch.
- [Horse Whinnies] - [Nervous Chuckle]
"I wanna fight justas dirty, Edgar."
His women.
Use his women.
Any information you have.
The son ofa bitch is not going to steal from me again.
Can you back me up on this?
Can I count on your support?
I look at itfrom the pointof viewthat the system can only take so much abuse.
- Itadjusts itself eventually.
- Yeah.
Butthere are times there are savage outbursts.
"The late Dr. King, forexample."
- Amoral hypocrite.
- [Snorting]
"Screwing women like a degenerate tomcat, stirring up the blacks, preaching against oursystem."
Sometimes the system comes very close to cracking.
We've already had one radical in the White House.
I don't believe itwould survive another.
[Whinnying]
"Well, like I said, uh, Edgar..."
You ask... if you can count on my support.
As long as I can count on yours.
"[Nixon] Yeah, the old queen did it on purpose."
"No, he wasn't protecting me."
He was just putting me on notice.
- [Haldeman] That he knew Roselli?
- No.
Hoover knew a lotof gangsters.
Johnny Roselli wasn't justany gangster.
Everything is going absolutely according to plan.
Right now the most important thing to me
Is sending jake home.
It's mind-boggling.
"Like, I just wanna punch the guy."
"I can't do it, so I'm gonna punch him mentally"
"And just beat down his spirits, drive him crazy."
He's gonna go nuts.
"He's gonna try to talk his way out of everything,"
And there's nothing he can do.
"Peace, bro."
Jake's a joke.
I'll be damned if I lose the next competition to him.
(woman) good night.
♪
(chris) guys!
Let's go!
(jake) right now my position's a little unique.
"You know, I came in with a huge target on my back."
I'm...
Pretty confident that
Everybody's starting to get to know me.
There's a pretty good consensus.
"You know, ""jake is-- wow, he's really not a jerk"
"That he wawaportrayed as."""
I'm in a pretty good spot.
Yeah!
(chris) come join me for today's challenge.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
But winning the competition is still very important.
"Very, very important."
- Shut up.
How do you like the new you?
Did I interrupt the procedure?
Can Henry not talk yet?
"- No, he can't."
No.
"- Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here... might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
"Nice to meet you, Timothy."
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Yeah.
Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry's understanding of how good he looks now?
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the... below the elbow and the...
the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a football-sized dent...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"Um, the skull was dented in and there was this, um... his eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces."
Just about right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little strenuous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Whatever.
Something the matter?
"The minute the two of us are alone, you can't wait to get out of here."
That's not true.
"The other day, we had that long conversation about stamps."
"About how the price always goes up, but never goes down."
- Did you wanna revisit that?
- You know what I'm talking about.
You and Christine got divorced and it's kind of like we did too.
"But, whatever."
I guess I'm the jerk for even caring.
- Are you serious?
"- No, forget I said anything."
I guess I'm the ass for bringing it up.
"Okay, okay."
You know what?
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I guess things have changed.
"Um, look, I've got errands, and then later I'm taking Ritchie to the batting cages."
You're welcome to come along if you want.
- We could spend the day together?
"- Yeah, it'll be fun."
"We'll grab burgers, go to the batting cages, anything you want."
"- That'll be great, Dad."
- Did you just...?
- No.
- Good.
[SIGHS]
CHRISTINE:
"Good morning, ladies."
Or should I say bonjour and...
Real life with the boring bits cut out.
Don't confuse facts with truth and for Christ sake... don't get either way in the story.
Now...we know how it starts...
Johnnie in France.
We know how it ends.
Home safe.
"And we know somewhere in between, we have..."
"dog, Dunkirk, engine failure and uncle's death."
"Now all we have to do is, fill-in-the-gaps."
I'm buyin' it.
Down payment.
Call it a trend.
"Call it what you like, but I'm not leaving London."
Hmmp...
Sorry we're not...
"Buckley, Parfitt."
Meeting now.
Ministry of War Transport.
Seems they had wind of your proposed filming scenario.
"Apparently they are concerned that,"
"""The Nancy Starling"" engine failure may cost moral sapping doubt on the quality of British engineering."
It was her.
Bloody Ministry spy!
What if it's not the engine?
What if it's the propeller?
"It gets snarled up with blotsun and Uncle Frank goes in the water to free it, gets shot and the girls have to finish the job."
And the fire.
Not the girls.
Not the girls?
Aaa...
Johnnie!
Johnnie?
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
Less than I'll save if I get that information.
That doesn't make it right.
- It's still playing God.
"- That's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
- Don't preach to me.
- No.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove that I was different from him.
Only to realise that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiancé.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother but I didn't save her.
She died anyway.
"So they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
They deserved to live.
"Clare, have you ever saved anyone that didn't?"
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Fuck!
Fuck me!
Fuck!
Can somebody get this fuck off me?
MAN:
Where's Hendricks?
"Cool, right?"
Are you for real?
Are you blind?
Or am I invisible?
There's no money here!
"If that bothers you, you're welcome to leave."
"Calm down, Franz."
I see how you are  and I like what I see.
"Here, Jesus and the merchants."
It's all in there.
- Only no one understands it anymore.
- It's a culturally useless artifact.
It's quite heavy.
Shall I quickly summarize it?
"I can read, thank you."
"Jesus enters the temple, it's filled with merchants..."
"He flips the tables over, and says:"
"My house shall be a place of worship, but you've turned it into death pit."
"Okay, you want to attract more guests, right?"
"Generally, yes."
But who would want to come here?
Let me worry about that for now.
Do you two need a priest now or what?
Who's that?
- That is a man in a monkey mask.
I thought so.
What does he want?
Hannes is a television producer.
"Yes, but what is he doing here?"
He's interested in this place.
Is he also interested in us?
"- Yes, he is."
Why am I in this filthy place eating cup noodles?
"Listen, Kim, I'm not the kind of person who belongs here."
Where do you belong?
Know the Grand Pacific?
It's a 5 star hotel.
No?
I worked there.
"Some stuff happened and I'm sort of stuck here for now, but I'll be back working at a first class hotel."
"This is just a temporary gig, you understand?"
Temporary?
Know that word?
"Room 307, vacating."
"They're out, can you go clean?"
Do it in 20 minutes.
Boss scolds me for slow turnaround.
Where's Suzuki San?
I saw her by the fire escape.
"No, no, no!"
"Don't go return it, we can just pay the late fee."
"You can't go out, okay?"
"Please, just don't."
I'll go return it later.
Okay?
"No, you can't!"
You hear?
What're you doing out here?
I need you on cleaning duty.
Right.
Here for bill collection.
What did Suzuki San do before coming here?
People who end up at places like this have their reasons.
It'd be wise to not pry too much.
"What I mean is, not in person."
I see.
He's just heard about you.
We have an Internet romance.
The Internet.
Really?
It'll be six months in April.
You're my second client who's found someone on the Internet.
"There was a girl from Goias State, not bad-looking... rather provincial, who married a French computer professor."
Gary is a visual artist.
An artist makes a lot of money in the US.
Americans respect artists.
Yesterday he told me that he loved me.
I get goose bumps talking about these things.
"6'2"", waist-length hair."
Any tattoos?
He only mentioned one:
a huge tribal symbol on his back.
You're going to meet this Gary.
I'm going to give you a discount I wouldn't give my own mother.
Fifteen percent.
Thank you.
""" Marjorie and Jo-Jo live and work in New York City."
They have been married for one year.
"- They have a big dog called Rex."""
"- Settle, people."
"""They live in a very big apartment on Fifth Avenue."""
Fifth.
Shut up!
"Shut up, guys."
"She said, ""Shut up!"""
- Thank you.
"For the public opinion, and in agreement with his family, he was called Juve."
Why did you hide me the truth?
I had given Monsieur Havard my word that no one would know the truth.
And I kept to my word.
Why passing up for dead?
To better track Fantomas?
Exactly.
I learned that Lady Beltham had fled to England.
I knew Fantômas would join her.
So what?
I crossed the Channel: unfortunately he had just left for Canada.
And you have changed your face.
Yes.
To start again at the same level.
"Not without difficulties,"
I got introduced to this band of hoodlums that you know.
People who may work for Fantômas?
That's right:
"Cut-Nose, Gas-light, Mother Toulouche."
Because... they began thieving again.
"Fandor, Fantomas is back."
"Why not arrest Nibet, Nose-cut"
- and the others?
- No.
"No, they are small fry."
Small-time criminals.
No.
"I let them act freely and thanks to them,"
I'm sure that I will find Fantômas.
But for now...
"""Tail-hair"" I am, and ""Tail-hair"" I will remain."
It's the name they gave you?

Get out!
Mrs. Brendan?
Yes.
You wanted to see me?
"Yes, I did."
"The, uh, girl said it was urgent, Mr..."
"Uh, Hoolick."
I'm Wilbur's father.
"Oh, how nice to meet you."
Do sit down.
Thank you.
I hope our keeping Wilbur here didn't inconvenience you.
"A little, but it's going to be all right."
When did you want to take him home?
"Uh, now."
"Yes, sir."
Commander...
"Don't worry, sir."
I will go.
"No, that's crazy."
Woo-song...
"Commander, let me go."
Lt. Suh can't go.
The Japanese will recognize him.
I will go instead.
You won't make it back alive.
"I know, sir."
Chun Woo-song...
It will make my wife and my son proud.
Confirm Chun Woo-song's position and go directly to the Field Marshal.
"Yes, sir."
Chun Woo-song!
Everything is riding on this letter.
This is our last chance to wipe out the enemy.
We will exact revenge for you and your family.
"I will sacrifice my life for the mission, sir."
What brings you here?
I have a request.
A request?
I will strike Konishi again on the 18th of this month.
Without Yu Jong and the ground forces?
That's right.
Are you proposing that you and I strike Wekyo alone?
No.
I'm asking you to make the Japanese think that Chosun Navy will attack Wekyo on the 18th.
"I know about our meetings with the Japanese, Admiral."
Tell them that I am preparing a full-force attack on the Wekyo.
I know.
I know.
"Okay, this is going to sound a little weird, and I know it's going to sound a little weird, okay?"
[Inhales deeply]
Here goes.
I can see things that--
That what?
That most people can't.
"You mean, like, ghosts?"
No.
No.
Not the dead.
"Well, that's good."
"Look, apparently, my ancestors from Germany, the Grimms, well, I guess I'm related to them."
My mother's side of the family had the same ability.
What kind of ability are we talking about?
See these books?
They're filled with drawings made by my ancestors and some other people who had the same ability.
"And the drawings are of Wesen, which is how they like to refer to themselves."
"Who, the Grimms?"
"No, the Wesen."
And that's what I can see.
What the Grimms could see.
And there are all kinds of them.
They're kind of like species that exist within us-- some of us.
"Anyway, there's Blutbad and Bauerschwein,"
"Fuchsbaus, Eisbibers."
Remember that fire dancer Ariel?
- Yeah.
- She was a daemonfeuer.
A dragon thing.
And they're all in these books.
Why did you dump her?
- She hated Indians
"You like Indians, don't you?"
- When do we reach Zurich?
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe
"So beautiful, so pretty."
"Sometimes, I fear, it might become dirty"
Here for the first time?
- Yes
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?
Train leaves Zurich at 11:30tomorrow.
We have a whole night and half a day
We'll be there on time.
"- Still, if we could..."
"What had to happen, has happened."
Now you're with me
Nothing can go wrong
Europe is best done on foot
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So I never felt the need for a friend
You can't live the rest of your life with friends.
Sometime or the other... you will need someone who will walk by you all your life
Can't walk anymore.
I'm tired.
- Do I pick you up in my arms?
I can't afford a hotel.
Let's try that house.
We might find lodgings
"Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of renegade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So then they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
Jeanine needed a reason to petition the Council to institute martial law.
Now she has one.
(CHUCKUNG)
Staying here at Amity is still our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground.
Find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can make a move.
We need to kill Jeanine.
I know.
But we're not ready yet.
(SIGHS)
"Beatrice, you're not being serious, right?"
"No, I am being serious."
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
"Tris, you can't just go around killing people."
"No, she's right."
Listen to your sister.
"Tris, I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself."
"I'll stay with Caleb so that you don't get him killed, too."
What?
PETER:
"Come on, you know."
Like you did your parents.

What do you think you're doing?
My office.
Now.
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
"When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers."
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
"All right, I'll sign, but on one condition."
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one.
In case.
"No, you don't."
"Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand?"
Shake on it?
Hurry up.
"Excuse me, miss."
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Lf we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail."
- Come this way.
"- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins."
"- I'm going, Emmy."
He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
"Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding?"
Be reasonable.
Thank you.
And you're pretty pretty.
Thank you.
"Well, there are some people dying, so we should..."
I have a meeting to get to.
"I'll see you later, Sara."
"Hope to hear from you soon, Riley."
Awesome.
"Okay, this is not good."
This is not good.
This is totally weird.
- What's weird?
- You.
Going out with Dr. Lonsdale.
That guy's my hero.
My roommate can't date my hero.
Just like you can't date my dentist.
Remember that?
"So, I haven't heard from Riley in a month now."
Shouldn't I have some sort of anesthetic?
Please.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
"I mean, it's not like I'm going to embarrass you or anything."
"What, you think I'm going to embarrass you?"
It's a strong possibility.
"Well, I will have you know that I have dated congressmen."
And two hockey players.
I think I can hold my own with a measly doctor.
Where are you getting all these good dates?
Bam.
"Oh, hey, you remember Noah from our flag football team?"
Yeah.
"You'd say ""man of my life."""
"I think ""soul mate"" is more romantic."
Good morning.

"Sir Charles' health, no doubt?"
"Yes, yes."
"Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, it upsets me to see you like this."
It isn't right.
"All work, as the saying goes, sir."
"They say there's a very interesting musical show at the Vanity Fair, sir."

"Quite so, sir."

Don't worry.
Ogami-sama will give us a quick answer...
I'm sure it will send us armed troops.
Help!
Well...
In this town... there's nothing left to take.
In that case we shouldn't be helping wandering samurais...
That demon... could be a white bear?
"No, its 10 feet tall, and it's a red big monster, demon like."
A monster...
We are begging you to help us.
"Exterminate the demon, please!"
"Since then, that demon, night after night keeps coming..."
"Kidnaps young girls, and destroys everything,"
"Already in this town, that's the only girl left."
We are not able to hold that girl any longer.
There's nothing to do.
No one can match with that thing...
Kao!
"O-samurai-sama, I beg you!"
"In the name of God and Buddah, we depend on you, Samurai-sama."

"Uh, what are you called?"
Jeng-Ko Cheng.
I'm a police officer from Shandong.
I'm here to arrest you.
You see?
For these 19 crimes.
"Ah, never mind."
I really shouldn't have made you come all this way to arrest me.
I'll go quickly with you.
Well then?
What do you say?
"Ah, you are a government officer, right?"
So what?
(laughing)
"When you get promoted to officer rank, or you've been arranged to become police commissioner, how much money do you think you'll make each month?"
"Working for government, money's not important."

It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?

"Holy shit, mike, he's pissing blood."
"All right, call an ambulance."
Sean?
"- Hey, franc."
- Hey.
Lot of iron on that bar.
"What is that, 200, 240?"
"Oh, I don't know, maybe 280 on a good day."
"Animale, this kid, huh?"
Yeah.
"Got a proposition for you, franco."
Yeah?
"Well, I'm very flattered, lou, but I don't believe in gay marriage."
- Hilarious.
- This kid cracks me up.
"No.Now look, we saw you beating the heavy bag into submission the other day."
"We were wondering, maybe you ever thought about stepping into the ring."
- Boxing?
"- No, bullfighting."
What are you doing?
"Look, I cornered a couple of fighters back in the day, and i think you got potential."
- You got a thunderous left.
"- Thanks, lou."
"You, uh, you used to be a boxing trainer?"
"Yeah, indeed I was."
I took joltin' joel johansson to the department title back in '86.
He had a brief but minorly successful golden gloves run.
No shit.
You guys talking about slow joel johansson?

Wow.

Whoo!
Welcome to your second competition.

I don't want jake here.
Who do you want to see go home this week?
That is a hit.

I'm in control.
Do you think you deserve to be here?
"Yes, I do."
That's full of (bleep).
"Like, honestly, come on."
You don't deserve to be here.
There's nothing more in me that wants to reach out

"That's for my girlfriend."""

You can still find love.
"Seeing you, like, makes me realize that..."
"I really want you to be happy, you know?"
Here's to you and I having already taken
The most important prize of this competition.
"I think from here on out, it's you and I till the end."

Pronto.
The old town was built in 1647 and I think some of the residents can remember back that far.
"- Oh, the cricket green looks lovely."
"- Ah, yes."
My husband Stuart plays.
He's a very aggressive bowler but very frisky afterwards.
You can get everything you need from this one parade of shops.
shirley Thompson flowers.
Bit low rent.
Uses her own excrement to fertilise the pot plants but I can get you a discount on everything except shrubs.
And what have we here?
"Ah, yes."
The Wicker Barn.
Mm.
"Used to sell gorgeous, hessian pIacemats."
- till it tragically burnt down.
- It looks fine to me.
"hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
Looks like they're closing early tonight.
- so you do care a little bit -- a very little bit.
- what?
no!
i didn't ask my mama to leave me this place.
- so why didn't you sell it?
- 'cause.
- 'cause why?
"- 'cause i just didn't, okay?"
kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes.
- what'd you say?
i couldn't hear you.
"- i said it kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes -- big, fat, hairy deal."

- ohh!
what an idiot!

The wolf is by nature a pack animal and one of the few proud members of the animal kingdom that mates for life.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
"Hello, Jen."
"Welcome, Jennifer."
Thank you.
"For you, the noble honeybee."
The honeybee is committed.
"And though it may fly from flower to flower, collecting the sweet, sticky nectar' it has no choice but to return to the hive."
Congratulations.
Thank you.
That's a big-ass bee.
"Finally, Ronnie and David."
I have thought long and hard about this.
I could not decide with my mind.
I had to open my soul to the animal spirits.
"And, finally..."
"Okay, the build-up's killing me."
What do we got here?
Two cheetahs?
Couple of eagles?
You got two lions?
The ass.
You are the ass.
Stubborn and immovable.
The mighty ass tirelessly bears the heavy burden of others.
"But when the ass is on the move, nothing can stop the ass."
Be an ass for your marriage.
Be an ass for your children.
Be an ass for love.
"Thank you, Marcel."
I'm gonna be the biggest ass you've ever seen.
"- hey, baby."
- hi.
"hope you don't mind, but i charged a few things on your account."

"- do you love me, or don't you?"
- of course i do.
that's why i'm still here.
"- well, if you're still here, then let's make the most of it, right?"
can you do me a favor before you get off?
- what?
"- [sighs] apparently, the kids should eat more than just cheez whiz."
can you pick up some food?
thank you.
you're the best.
- [sighs] [drops clipboard]
"- [gasps] [chuckling] oh, my... oh, my rock goodness!"
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
-lt is a war after all.
-Yes.
- Everything is all right.
-You know I was going to face a real war.
I prepared myselffor hardships or even death.
And we live in the headquarters like in paradise.
We sleep on beds.
As ifthere were no war around.
"We drink milk, listen to birds, walk around with boys like you."
"Everything is as usual, do you understand?"
-The offensive is to start soon.
- Really?
"-Olya, can I have a look in the gunsight?"
-You'll survive without that.
"You know, Kolya, a real marksman never makes two shots from the same place."
And this guy does everything the otherway.
-He way not be a real ace after all.
"- No, he is."
He seems to play hide-and-seek with me.
He seems to say:
""" lfyou are smart - look for me."
He must have about five secure firing positions here.
This one is the fourth one.
And your canister shot was made from the last one.
-What?
- Forthe first time you...
-What?
-You smiled...
-At last. I see his position.
-Where is he?
-At last orthe life was becoming boring..
-Where is he?
I'm cold.
It's actually about 110 in here.
There's no way it's warm in here.
- Do you really feel warm?
- You could grow tomatoes in here.
"Honestly, it is unbelievable."
"Well, I can't make it cooler for you."
"Well, we're taking the credit."
"No, we're taking the credit."
How about a compromise?
We'll take all the credit.
"- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty?"
- What bounty?
"Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but..."
"Dan, Amy, how are you?"
I'll take it from here.
- I want to take in Pierce.
"- Whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
We are not going into the White House and blowing our cover for this guy.
You can't come in.
That comes from the president.
"- Well, she's a bitch."
- I'll tell her you said hi.
"Hey, we got to get moving."
"Hey, you guys."
Long time no see.
"Jesus, Mike, they got you involved in this?"
You're the fucking press secretary.
Thank you.
That's what I've been saying.
I have no wish to be embroiled in this either.
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you...
Don't worry.
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
It has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
What do you think?
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
Want me to tell you how safe?
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month, they're gonna give me a gold safety award."
What do you think of that?
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
I sure hope you're a good tipper.
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh... record.
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post traumatic stress.
"Yeah, and unofficially?"
I don't really think that's any of your concern.
My job's to disorganise crime.
Illegally.
I prefer to use the world irregular.
"Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
Unfortunately a million extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould.
Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him either.
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"Niece and nephew, right?"
Yeah.
"I haven't got 'em any presents, though."
A bit behind when it comes to computer games and stuff like that.
You should talk to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games."
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John, that'd be irresponsible!"
That's not their age range at all!
How did it go with Lenny?
"Yeah, pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"I guess that's what you did in the Army, right?"
Wrong.
That was legal.
Yeah.
why?
Brígida Bonazzi.
A change sex?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
-She is not patient mine.
It excuses.
"It matters to him, young lady?"
Thus it will learn to bother an honest worker of the street.
What has done to him?
We were in charge.
"Help, please."
"But, who is Brígida Bonazzi?"
Four Fernets Branca for the horsemen.
Thank you.
"Strip, strip."
You watch what handsome.
You watch that teats and what ass.
Mother mine!
"It is already enough, Alvaro.?"
What you do?
They are going to us to stop to all by insult to the modesty.
Desínflala already.
"Sight that curved, it is not looked like Lella?"
"Alvaro, I will not get tired of decírtelo, you are rich, stupid and also a jerk."
To the women it is necessary to deal with them with hand iron.
Muéstrale to Lella the man that you are.
So that I have decided that it is better than not we see more.
If it is what you want...
"Pity, had made me a bikini of crochet for this summer and she wanted ensenártelo."
A bikini?
-Yes.?
You want that it embosoms it to you?
Put down that gun.
that's it.
Number 43?
!
Yu Ominae!
You are nothing more than a killing machine.
I'm...
You've seen the death of your parents on the people you've killed.
Such a thing must have drove you mad.
I am not a machine.
I am a human being.
even if I must die.
A human?
God?
You make me laugh.
Where on earth is a God who was made by humans?
when it began resonating with your power.
What do you think you can do with that body full of junk?
I am God!
I will kill all of Man!
you will already be dead!
Idiot.
Damn it!
just a little more... and my nightmare's would have been washed away!
A brats fairy tale dream is over.
What are you doing?
I said that I wasn't going to be a tool for murder.
Noah's self-destruct sequence has just been activated.
What?
which was in different dimensional space will be swallowed up by three-dimensional space.
Bastard!
We've discovered many magnetic fields similar to Noah's.
- Did you sleep with her too?
- I touched her.
That's all.
- You can't use your powers--
"- Save the lecture, okay?"
- She's taken Kenzi.
- Goddamn it.
Did you think you could get between me and Bo?
It wasn't on my radar one way or the other.
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry.
You're just the bait.
It'll be over quick once Bo gets here.
"Actually, I prefer slow and drawn out."
"There's no reason to rush anything, you know?"
I knew you'd come.
How could I resist such a romantic gesture?
- You're not mad?
- No.
At you?
"Jenny, no."
You're my destiny.
I love you.
Nobody ever loves me as much as I love them.
Everyone whoever said they loved me they all left.
But I always keep a piece of them close.
Samir was no different.
"A coward in the end, too scared to love me back."
- You killed him.
- I went to his home to tell him that I totally accepted it was over.
He was so relieved.
Then I drugged him and cut off his head.
"- My, oh, my, oh, my."
"But we'll get it, if we have to take a knife, stick somebody and take it away from 'em."
- Yeah!
"- Come on, Shorty."
Mush!
- Come on.
Let's go.
- All set.
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back.
"We've gotta make a touch, Shorty."
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine.
"Yeah, I been noticing that."
You're the doctor.
You know what's good for ya.
"The way I figures it, hunting for gold's a full-time job."
"Anything that interferes with it, interferes with it."
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
Mind keeping that fat snoot of yours out of my affairs?
"All right, all right."
"No offense, boss."
No offense whatsoever.
- Where's Buck?
- Hmm?
Come on!
"My, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!"
Can't you see that's poisoned meat?
That's the second time he's attacked me!
"Yeah, he's crazy about you!"
Can't you see?
"Wait a minute, partner."
I'll give you a chance to make some money.
Astal thinks he's going to a safe place.
Fifty Magic Knights.
What a clown.
He thinks he can bare his fangs at the prince and win.
Hilarious!
You sick-minded manipulator!
Don't you dare look at my sister that rudely!
The prince?
Brother.
"What's the matter, Sister?"
I can't breathe!
"Ferris, you always spoil Iris so."
Jobs should be thoroughly finished.
"If we let a man like this live, it would sully the Eris family, would it not?"
What's your intent?
Is the prince behind this?
Does that mean Sion is also a prince?
The Eris family serves only the king of Roland.
The true king.
The king?
We must see whether or not Sion would be a suitable king.
"Will he make it back alive, faced with a troop of fifty Magic Knights?"
Impossible.
I could do it.
Sion isn't you.
He most certainly isn't.
But he carries something.
"You met Sion, and as a result, you saved his life."
Don't you find that fascinating?
"I'm not particularly fascinated, no."
Staying asleep
Losing sight of you
"I'm reminded of something Descartes once said,"
"""Whether I am awake or asleep, two and three will always make five."
"""A square can never have more than four sides."
"""It does not seem possible that truths"
"""so clear and apparent can be suspected of any uncertainty."""
"Uh, this book has taken me over 14 years to write."
It is not without a little sadness that I say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights.
And nights...
Um...
And so...
And as I stand here...
"And so, in coming up..."
Summing up...
Uh...
"Excuse me, I'm feeling a little dizzy."
Uh...
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I would know more.
I don't.
"I don't know anything, really."
Thank you all for coming.
Thanks.
Thank you.
"Oh, God."
What did I say?
"It was fine, although I'd think twice about doing volunteer work for a suicide hotline."
You were doing okay until Candice walked in.
"Don't start, Henry."
I just forgot to eat.
You should never drink on an empty stomach.
"Listen, it's perfectly natural."
"She left you what, a year ago?"
My phone has a clock.
And they subsist on a diet...
- of pointlessly weird combinations.
- Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber-jalapeño egg cream."
- Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get going.
"- Right, okay."
"Then, later, at a club in Chinatown... somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair... some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
How old does she think you are?
So were you in Vietnam?
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot.
She likes old guys.
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, thi..."
I swear.
This is what all the 20-year-olds look like.
"I wanna thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
- Colonel.
- Oh.
- I gotta end this.
- You are amazing.
- I feel like you can tell that I tried to spit my gum out.
- Such a terrible actor.
"- Oh, my God."
"I love the audience, like, reaction whenever Ari does something gross."
- It's so amazing.
- People really get vocal.
"Okay, this is my favorite thing, right here."
"Sounds like fun, right?"
Not always.
Scary.
"- That is a genius, genius line."
- So good.
Genius.
Ari.
And that was all you.
You made all that up.
You guys are so supportive.
I love you.
I guess Jonny looks a little like Josh Harnett.
- I can see it.
- He's just so chiseled.
- But I don't think that they look...
- So chiseled.
He's angular.
"I love the end of this scene what you guys do, what Mike and Kat do."
You're relating to each other silently for one of the only times in the movie.
"And there's this whole thing, Mike, where..."
Now you decided you gonna be on her side and not on your friends' side.
Right.
"If you watch carefully, you do this gesture that's like..."
- We're a team.
Be cool.
"Okay, you're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates."
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.
All right?
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
"Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table..."
And we're sure of that?
No shanking!
"All right, all right."
The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
You don't give us the name of your supplier...
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
"Yeah, you cooperating?"
"Okay, let's start with a name."
He just goes by Heisenberg.
"Heisenberg, huh?"
How old is this Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
My baby has no shot at a normal life.

"You, too."

"- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?"

"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
Damas.
Vengan conmigo.
[speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish]
"Uh, what-"
- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?
"Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?"
I'm putting them on a bus.
Why?
What bus?
One that takes them back to Honduras.
"Hey, wait a second."
Wait a minute.
Th-Th-This was my idea.
Don't punish them.
"You tell Gus to blame me, not them."
He does.
"Give us a minute, will you?"
We won't be too long.
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple of local nobodies.
"Very disciplined, though, not keeping anything for themselves."
"It was all about sending a message, which they did, literally."
It was written on the bucket lid.
"""Ready to talk?"""
"That, I believe, is the English translation."
"I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, 15 more good operators, and we hit them back, hit them hard, hit them where they live."
No.
This war stays cold for now.
What about their message?
What's the answer?
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.
We've got to get into that room.
A room that's losing evidence as we speak.
I know.
"It's just, I thought coming back to D.C."
Would feel like old home week or something.
- Home is overrated.
- God.
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What are you doing here?
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What is he doing?
I had a hunch about something
From Pete's description and I just need to see this with my own eyes.
You two have a plan to get in there?
Yeah.
We're gonna crawl under the motion sensors--
Yes.
There's an access panel on the roof.
"We can go in through the-- well, please, ladies first."
No.
"You know what, you--you be the smart one this time."
"Okay, get this,"
There's an access panel on the roof.
It'll bring us in right above the main wiring
For the security system.
"Now, if we crawl on our bellies, we can avoid the motion sensors."
"And what do you mean ""this time""?"
All right.
I get the idea.
"If I may, put these on."
Really.
Or you'll be of no use to me.
Does father have piles?
Actually my dad and I are thinking to come your home and discuss about marriage.
Marriage?
Who is this girl?
You wait mom.
I too have the same doubt.
Who are you?
Who am I?
- I will tell.
Friend of the Police officer who looks same as you or his girlfriend.
"Sorry, even I was confused before and now you are confused."
"He is not your guy, but our guy."
I don't believe this.
Your guy talks fluent in Hindi and my fellow murders it.
If required test him.
I am unable to understand what is happening here.
Is this true?
"Dad, what is she saying?"
- Hindi..
This is so strange.
"I just watched dual roles only in films, but never thought I would experience it."
"If you don't mind, I will take a photo and send it to my boyfriend."
Sure..
- He will be really shocked.
"Sorry uncle, sorry aunty I need to search where he is."
Bye..
Let us see the saris there.
Come on.
Tell the truth.
Is there another one just like you?
"Yes, he is there."
Here.
We will chop off your head And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in What the heck
Fall right down Break your
Face
Duloc is Duloc is
Duloc is a creepy place
Get out.
- Let's do that again!
- No!
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what?
I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes?
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story.
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
'Cause that's not scary.
"Actually, if you look at it from my perspective..."
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio?"
No one cares!
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy."
And it's all true.
... I'mMarybethCogan.
"""""Detectives' Endowment Association, Legal Affairs, Co-counsel. """""
Very nice card.
"I represent Santos, and you're muddying my client's name."
-Take it up with Corporation Council.
-And get it buried?
You should tell the mayor someone's taking him up the wrong street.
Maybe we could explore this in more detail.
Maybe over coffee.
I'm talking about a hero detective and his widow's pension.
Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.
The way Willie Horton sunk Dukakis...
... TinoZapatticansinkus.
Good afternoon.
Where you been?
My Brooklyn meeting.
How'd it go?
I think I just pissed up Frank Anselmo's leg.
And?
Felt good.
"Okay, Leslie."
"Tomorrow's Times, Post and News are all keeping the shooting..."
... onthefrontpage.
What'd you expect?
Nothing short of a triple ax murder will take it off.
"Keep feeding the press, morning and night."
Emphasize our tough stand on crime.
Let's get a coffee.
I don't want a coffee.
"Well, I do."
"So whatever character assassination you've got lined up for me, let's at least temper it with caffeine."
Who found her?
Some new lot just above us.
Had reason to pop into the loft and there was old fatty.
Only not so fat any longer.
Don't talk like that.
SHE SIGHS
The gossip on the street says it was a suicide.
"Come home, Peg."
We can't talk here.
I can't go back there.
I can't spend another night in that flat.
"Well, then we'll move."
"We'll put it on the market, we'll buy somewhere else."
"(It's not the flat, Elaine, it's you!"
)
(I can't be with you any longer!
)
Think very carefully about what you say next.
I've hired a van.
I'll be round on Friday to get what's mine.
You don't have to be there.
"In fact, it's better if you're not."
THUNDER

Most people miss first time.
You're going to be late.

(both) Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, excellency."
- CIaudette.
Ah.
velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, CIaudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (giggles)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."
"(piano transcription of Beethoven's ""Symphony No.6 in F"")"
"You're a fine shot, sir."
I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"""One warm word from you and I Iive."
"One brutal word and I die."""
"""It doesn't matter, for I am not afraid of death any more."""
"""I have already visited the beyond in your music."""
- will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
We have a match and a name - Denny Lorton.
Calls himself Pica.
He has form.
Sexual assault 30 years ago.
"God, this being a detective is easy."
The dead boy is Benjamin Rigby.
15 years old.
He's been selling himself for 18 months or so.
Had he been reported missing?
Mum's a junkie.
That lane was his beat.
Is this Lorton?
Reckon they can make this room any uglier?
Probably not.
It's like they think no-one actually has to work in here.
Why do we settle for ugly like it doesn't matter?
"A bit of colour there, painting there."
Some flowers.
I'm wasted in this profession.
"Pick this creep up, will ya?"
Tommy. (Whistles)
Hmm...
Hmm...
"Strictly cash these days, Manos."
Since when?
Since I woke up in a strange hotel room with third degree burns on my arse and no idea how they got there.
"I owe you big-time, mate."
"If you change your mind, give us a tinkle."
(Phone rings)
Red.
Good morning's work.
You humiliate a young cop and keep that clump of sink hair out of prison.
Nothing blew up.
There was no victims that were brought out
Or--or dead bodies.
There was nothing.
I don't understand.
Nothing blew up?
That's the weird part.
"It was--it was like a bomb, only backwards, okay?"
"Instead of blowing out, it--it--it yanked everything in."
- Implosion.
- Artie.
Artie.
Did the sword do this?
"And if it did, can I reconsider this mission?"
It didn't.
And what you have to do is you have to get in that room
And tell me exactly what you see.
That's a look I don't know.
It's called the past rearing its ugly head.
"So in other words, the sword didn't do whatever happened at the embassy."
But you know what did.
"Oh, God, I hope not."
"- Artie, where are you going?"
"- No, no, I can't--"
"First, I have to..."
- Hey.
- Here we go.
Round two with Mr. Congeniality.
"Mr. Ogawa, look, we've answered all your questions,"
And now we have a few for you.
"Actually, agent Bering, I have one more."
Why does the secret service need to send two different units
- How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects.
- Keep laughing.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
We've got a dead nurse.
You stay right here.
Don't move.
"Absolutely, Dad."
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Prick!
"Paula Puglusi, a nurse."
Same M.O. as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her?
- Yeah.
"- God, Tom, I'm sorry."
Does that guy you were chasing have something to do with this?
- He was a witness.
- In the Polish Hill case?
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During the pursuit of the suspect my father was killed.
- Chicanis said he saw the killer.
- And you don't believe him?
This was the case where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said a cop killed my father.
You want to give her one more pop before they take her away?
- I'll give you one more pop.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Talk to the press for Uncle Nick.
"They are wonderful, aren't they?"
"For them, a painter who died is a painter whose quoted value goes up."
Look at Modigliani.
Barbey and Nanteuil are astute businessmen.
You see evil everywhere.
Professional bias.
You should not stay here.
This house is full of souvenirs.
I know a wonderful boarding house.
I lived over there when I arrived in Paris.
Rather say that you fear for my life.
Is that it?
Yes.
Taste it.
It lacks a little of violet perfume.
I come back.
Whatever.
Remain by my side.
Why don't you want me to go?
It will take only thirty seconds.
It is April 12.
"I know, so what?"
It's the anniversary today.
The fatal date.
"Listen, Princess, every year at this date, it's the same."
You are afraid.
"Meanwhile, Mr Fantômas has not returned for four years."
I'm superstitious.
"Come on, you're going to Mr Thomery's bal later."
Exactly.
Mr Thomey was ill-advised to give up this bal barely a few days after the tragic death of my friend the Baroness de Vibray.
I tried to dissuade him.
- All for you.
A $25 savings bond.
That's a long-term investment.
"Don't touch it for 30 years, you're looking at $45."
- A youth hostel card.
- For the young girl... who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with strangers.
'What Color Is Your Parachute?
A practical manual for job hunters. '
Helping you answer:
What you wanna do and where you wanna do it.
A DVD of The Graduate.
Got to have that.
The Portable Nietzsche.
"Light, cheery reading."
An application to join the armed forces.
"If your dreams don't pan out, it's a viable option."
And something in a nice little velvet box.
A necklace.
The pearl almost looks real.
"It better look very real, because it is."
- That's not funny.
- This is not a funny gift.
"Christopher, this is extremely not funny."
This is totally humorless.
It's beautiful.
"I think you're awesome, Lor."
"With everything you do, and raising Rory the way you did... you're superwoman."
Have a great day.
Wish I could be there.
Take lots of pictures for me.
The camera.
I forgot the camera.
I am always scared that it might be too late.
I know that the path that I have chosen is wrong.
But when there is only one path left to be chosen the right and the wrong doesn't have any meaning.
The path that I chose following Avi's hunger and your tears that path took me to diverse destinations.
"Mother, I was a kid then."
I didn't know how difficult it would be to return from this path.
"Still, I didn't let my criminal activities affect Avi."
"Come back, Baba."
You have compensated more than you had to.
Return home now.
Take my oath.
"Take my oath, or I will slap you."
"Mother, shall I take your oath, your slaps, or food cooked by you?"
Eat the food first.
Come on.
- Mr. Kadar!
- Who is it?
- Where are you?
- l am here!
- Please come out.
- Just a minute.
"- Please let me see you, Government."
- Here is the government.
- Where are you?
- Here I am.
- What are you doing?
- l am counting the change.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- How are you?
- l am fine.
- What brings you here?
What's this?
These are some numbers I'm thinking of playing.
"Oh, no, no."
"Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's going to steal your numbers.
"Well, you'd be a fool not to."
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns and the theories of Sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton?
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends. 20."
"You're just shotgunning it, huh?"
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
It's not just about winning or losing.
It's the lottery.
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way than win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery Expert?"
"Well, I've got news for you."
Yes.
Okay?
There he is.
I'm coming to get you!
Reserve a special cell for me.
I'll be right back after stabbing him!
Poor husband.
Can one man be the reason for destroying another?
The curse of husbands will not spare you.
Be careful.
- It's okay.
Is the inspector's phone ready?
It is ready.
- Give it.
Do you know the old actor 'Bagavathar'?
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.
Why is he still using it?
May be he has his sentiments about it.
We can fix that then.
"I'll fix wifi, bluetooth, and all features in this."
Why would you do that!
So he can track all my activities and be a pain?
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.
"If the phone conks off again, take it to the museum."
Please don't bring it to my shop.
I'll pass the message to the inspector.
"Panju, if the victim was an outsider,"
He should have stayed in a hotel or at a lodge.
Why don't we enquire there.
I now know why we seem to set well together.
Checkmate.
Oh really?
Take care of him.
He's getting picked up in two hours.
"Okay, I see."
I appreciate it.
"Say, could you tie this?"
I knew that he had a screw loose somewhere.
Who would have thought he has such difficulties?
Wouldn't it be better if I call the police?
No!
Give Bulle a call.
He should pick him up.
"Say, could you put that gun away?"
"It's making me nervous, that thing in your hand."
"When I get nervous, I can't stop talking."
- Everybody has problems.
"Tell me, this isn't that Pope troupe?"
Pope dancers.
"It'll be great, I promise."
Background for Nora.
Hopefully not this hip-hop shit.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be great.
"Next time, you change your shirt."
Chic!
"Recently, my neighbor has been leaving her trash in front of my door."
She said that she didn't notice.
"The fact that it fell over, and brown sauce dripped all over my carpet..."
"She didn't notice that either, right?"
"She said, that she didn't do it on purpose."
And that's just not nice.
To the contrary.
Come... come...
"But, Professor, we haven't finished."
Can't you see that I have things to do?
I have a lot to do.
Aren't you going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Won't you expell them?
- I'll think about it.
- How magnanimous.
"I'll make you pay for this, or my name isn't Cicchirini."
- We're innocent.
- You're a bunch of fools!
We're what?
Are you really going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Of course not.
That was just a joke.
"When I was young, I was worse than them, my dear Ms. Cappia."
"Cappi, Professor."
I just wanted to make sure that nothing would happen to me.
Nothing yet...
Professor!
What are you doing?
"You haven't heard of the prowess of ""Professor Saw-Saw""?"
I couldn't breathe!
It makes me not want to have sex.
I need breath mints?
"No, darling, but I'd be more comfortable in your home."
It's warmer and more relaxing.
- But it's much more romantic here.
- Alright...
Don't make a sound.
Who's there?
Your mom and dad have no time for you.
"On the other hand, grandma will make sure you never go wanting."
- What's this?
- A gift for you.
- Another one?
- Won't you open it?
What is it?
"I picked something different, to see if you like it."
You hardly ever play with your toys!
This old lady is yours.
"When you feel like hearing a story, she will tell you one."
We can get people as presents?
She is the greatest storyteller around.
Don't you like stories?
"When you're tired of reading, just say ""tell me"", and she will."
Isn't that great?
Talk to my grandchild.
Hello.
How do they call you?
The Storytelling Lady.
"Grandma, you can buy people?"
- Is it expensive?
"- Depends, I guess."
Are there people stores?
"There's no such thing, my angel."
So how did you-
You're impossible when you get something in your head!
"You want me to talk, right?"
"Talk, not ask."
It's time for grandma to get some rest.
Stay here and play with your new toy.
Don't be shy.
‐ You could.
You won't.
Because then it's over.
It's all over.
It's all over.
‐ How do you do it?
"How do you live with yourself, Cal?"
"I mean, the truth."
And not what you preach.
Because I'm having a really hard time.
‐ It's hell.
Um...
"It's a living, waking hell."
"I'm never without regret, much as it goes against everything we teach."
Much as it goes against everything we teach.

We turn to you.

Because?
Because the...
"""The None"" is launching, and Alexis owes me a draft of the third chapter."
It's four days late.
Julianne is breathing down my back.
"And, of course,"
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
Again.
"Plus we got the hydro bill, and it's crazy this month."
Yeah.
Anything else you wanna stress about?
Point taken.
"Hey, I'll pick up the dry cleaning."
It's gonna be ok.
It always is.
Thanks.
"We think of them as solid, immutable."
"The world may change around us, but our relationships?"
They remain constant.
"No, and I agree."
"I think that the orgasm chapter is compelling, but I feel like it's coming too soon in the book."
"Uh, no pun intended, I hope."
And chapter three?
"Where's that one, exactly?"
"Uh, I'm hoping it's in my inbox."
"Hey, what're you doing here?"
"Just, uh..."
I didn't sleep last night.
I kept thinking about what you said.
And I realized that this was a big mistake--
"Oh, please do."
Go ahead.
I shouldn't keep you longer.
Students who are willing to go to class!
"This way, Mr. Kaan."
You'd better cut your hair.
I don't want to see it like this again.
Who could give us the multiples of this?
"Yeah, take your time."
Take the chalk.
But I didn't raise my hand Professor.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't raise my hand.
You'd better answer this question before I divide you up by your multiples.
"Come on kid, come on."
Sit down!
Hey listen;
I have the voice of a dramatic soprano.
I am now an alto and do you know why?
Because I've lost my voice while making a demo.
But my album is being delayed.
How could this be?
Alright!
"Move it, move it."
I beg you.
"Dude, don't these teachers ever change?"
Do they always choose the ones who don't raise their hands?
That's their tactic.
"In Professor Fatma's class if you raise your hand, you're safe."
Really?
We'll see about that.
We're now doing geometry.
We don't live far from here.
thanks.
- That would be lovely!
My name is Dr. Rice.
But you can call me Zander if you like.
My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
I'm offering you the possibility...
Caliban. save your friends.
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.
she's impure.
She wasn't made by nature.
She's a mistake of my own.
I did what I could and they burned me and beat me.
Your colleagues are savages.
I agree.
The Reavers were very ineffective.
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.
But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
I can't help you.

what does he have?
The old man.
Alzheimer's?
ALS?
A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain?
What a combo.
you know we got company.
{\i1\cH80ffff}That's wonderful.
have a seat.
sit up.
why don't you sit at the end of the table?
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
"- Excuse me, Mr. Klein."
You have a message.
Brother llango...
How many more are there?
Call any number of men.
This will be their fate.
You said I can't come alive.
I have come alive.
You said I can't save my father and my people.
I have saved them.
You said Konda Reddy is the King of Cuddappah.
But now I stand on his dead body.
You said whether I am real man.
"Yes, I am real man."
"To me, you're just a corpse."
If any Konda Reddy or Gocha comes here
I will slit their throats.
Stop.
"As you said, you have saved your father  your people."
No one can cross Cuddapah.
I've framed your people as naxalites.
"Courier, I woke up when you killed Cuddappah Raja."
We jailed your father as a naxalite.
"Just 5 minutes, I changed everything."
"To free the head of terrorists, police station vandalized."
Terrorists attacked police and escaped with arms  ammunitions.
How is it?
No inquiry for naxalites.
Encounter straight away.
It's our men.
Hey Inspector.
We got the shooting order.
Don't listen to anyone.
Just kill them all.
You have reached the voicemail box of...
Shit.
"All right, all right."
Is this one of those memory foam beds?
I've heard great things.
I hope you don't mind.
"We were waiting, so I had to take a little cat nap."
I'm not a young man anymore.
Who are you?
How did you get in my apartment?
I had some empathy for your father and his illness.
A man in his position shouldn't have to worry about owing his associate $50 million.
"I was willing to work with him, but then he was gone, in the wind, an apparition."
So I started to think... his sudden lack of presence was so that he wouldn't have to pay
Omar Sandahl.
That's me.
You killed Donnie.
Do you know where your father is?
No.
Hmm.
Then it's a good thing...
I know where you are.
Because if he disappears... you inherit his debt.
I'll get my money.
Finally.
Anika.
"""Sorry, been busy."
All good.
"Talk soon."""
Hmm.
Well...
There are some advantages to having the place still to ourselves.
- You won't get bored with a life of fresh air and bird-watching and jam-making?
"Not with you by my side, Joyce HazIedine."
Ah.
Three-nine-nine-eight-five?
"You got yourself a bargain, Joyce."
Pam Draper.
welcome to little Stempington.
"Oh, sorry."
How d'you know about us?

It's like a tardis in here.
"- Ah, one of the natives at last."
- Pam Draper.
pleased to meet you.
"There's some olive tapenade, walnut bread, few organic eggs."
- I'm really touched.
- You'd never get this in the metropolis.
"And I imagine you'II find policing a place like little Stempington a Iot easier, too, once you get started."
"Ah, very observant."
Excuse me.
hello.
That's a strong grip.
You must be Joyce's personal trainer.
"You ladies of little Stempington are a friendly lot, aren't you?"
"hello, Joyce."
hilary Davenport.
welcome to little Stempington.
"- We've done that bit, hilary."
"- Oh, Pam."
What a nice surprise.
"As I was saying, you were lucky to get one on the south-facing side of the close."
- I'm in the middle of bidding.
"Well, you better take a look at this first."
This is the real Ricky Stancati.
You've got an imposter.
I appreciate the update.
Ricardo.
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a rat.
Or a cop.
Or a fed.
"D.E.A. Agent, reporter, maybe."
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"The point is, you're busted, and whoever you're working with..."
They're dead already.
I don't need a gun.
"When I kill a man, I use my hands."
"Before you die, tell me something."
Do you believe in an afterlife?
I believe in angels.
Go.
Put your weapons down slowly!
Put 'em down!
"Amanda, I'm gonna get you home."
Your nightmare is over.
You'll get medical attention and he returned to your familias.
Looks like we closed Finch's last sweatshop.
You don't mind.
Charlie.
We're gonna be bringing in more warm bodies than planned.
"Need some transport, north face of the island."
I spoke to the head of the Bahamian police.
Finch and the bidders have been extradited to the U.S.
"Ah, you're kidding, right?"
"No, I'm not kidding, coop."
"It's been a really, really good year, okay?"
"Now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus."
"Ladies, refreshers."
"You're under arrest,"
Mr. Daly.
Get this animal out of here.
"See you later, baby."
"Well, it's about time."
Do you mind telling me
"Why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swill..."
With no access to a telephone?
"Well, I'll tell you what."
"You can borrow mine, mr."
Enright.
Use it to call your lawyer.
Let him know we're booking you for pandering
And possession of a controlled substance.
And we've got a good shot at tying you in to leslie stoltz's murder.
"Oh, please."
"You people just don't get it, do you?"
"You know, your good friend coop daly--"
He sold you out.
The actions you took led to leslie stoltz's death.
That's felony murder.
"Well, I could just say one little magic word."
What's that?
Car...
Do...
Za.
"The judge is going to toss this case out right away,"
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.
It's too late to give her any brothers and sisters.
"In your case, I'd say it wasn't."
"If I didn't like you so much, Matt... ."
No use...
"Now, Connie, don't you go proposing to me."
"- For you, doc."
- Excuse me.
Would you like a cigarette?
- Swain speaking.
- Thank you.
I'll be right over.
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor.
I'll see you later.
"Thanks, doc."
- Bye.
- Bye.
Doc Swain's always talking about babies.
- They're his stock-in-trade.
- Not a bad subject.
"We teach schoolchildren English and math and history, and yet we neglect what gives them the most trouble in life."
You don't recommend classes in baby-making?
Only in theory.
I intend to initiate a sex-education course in the school.
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
"No, sex is taboo in the home."
And it should be in the schools.
"Where would they learn it, in parked cars?"
"Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible."
Where am I?
Where are you?
Shoot!
You're in Radiator Springs.
The cutest little town in Carburetor County.
"Oh, great."
Just great!
"Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town."
"You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town!"
"So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off, you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene..."
- Dad-gum!
"- How'd that be, Tuhmater?"
- Cool!
- Mater!
What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?
To not to.
"Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court."
"Well, we'll talk later, Mater."
"""Later, Mater. "" That's funny!"
Ah!
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!
"Hey, you scratched my paint!"
"I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!"
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!
- Fascist!
- Commie!
"Officer, talk to me, babe."
How long is this gonna take?
"I gotta get to California, pronto."
Where's your lawyer?
Rose!
"- Hi, Alex."
- I can't believe it's you.
My God!
"Alex, get a fucking grip."
- You look incredible!
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she look incredible?
"- Yes, we already covered that."
"- Oh, yes!"
- Can I have another drink.
- I thought you hated salad.
- I do.
"I just can't eat a big cheeseburger in the middle of the day anymore, ya know?"
- Doesn't it bloat you?
- Bloat me?
- Yeah.
"- No, it doesn't bloat me."
"Actually, I thought it went really well with the spareribs I had for breakfast this morning."
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.
"I just thought we'd always be in the same boat, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
It made it easier somehow.
I know.
Tell you what.
I'll give you half my salad if you give me half your burger.
- We'll need some more dressing.
- Definitely.
Waiter!
"We all WANT to be attractive, but remember:"
One of the first things people notice... the one thing that makes a lasting impression... is... your smile.
"If you're like most people, your appearance is important to you."
I live next door to you.
Right there.
"Just so you know, I can't be your friend."
...Why not?
That's just the way it is.
who said I wanted to be your friend...?
!
god!
what am I supposed to do?
to go out in there and do it myself?
Huh?
what?
answer me
maybe I'm getting slow
maybe I want to get caught... maybe I'm just tired
excuse me can I get through here?
"As some of you may have heard, there was an incident last night and one of our recent graduates was killed..."
"I want assure you that everything possible is being done to find those responsible for this tragedy, but in the mean time we should all be on the lookout for any suspicious activity..."
Your safety is our number on concern.
"it's you again, huh?"
"You know, I really wanna be left alone.."
Me too.
So leave.
You leave.
I've lived here longer than you...
What is that?
...This?
It's a Rubik's Cube.
You don't know Rubik's Cube?
Is it a puzzle?
Yeah...
Wanna try?
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- Him hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
- If you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon!
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
I was thinking ifyou could talk...
- No.
"No way, Mr Daaga."
Vijay is a police officer.
And I am a lawyer.
It has happened many times before.
"He has arrested many criminals, and I have freed them."
But our friendship still prevails because he hasn't questioned me about my profession.
Nor I have interfered in his work.
And...
"Think ofthe devil, and here he is!"
We must leave.
Where were you all these days?
-Right here.
Shall we play a set?
ARer them.-l have taken one more case ofyours.
Balwant's.
You arrested him.
You are on to it?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
But his chances are grim.
- We'll see that in court.
Why did you take up this case?
-Come on!
It's my profession.
You know he's a first rate criminal.
Still you... lt's not for us to decide if he is guilty or decent.
Let the court decided over it.
You won't improve.
My client Mr Balwant Singh works for Roshan Electricals.
"On the 15th he was on his way to the bank to deposit 25,OOO in the company's account."
Yeah.
Previously on Gilmore Girls:
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...
Jess was driving and you had an accident?
But I'm fine.
What accident?
Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it.
- Have you talked to Dean?
"- No, he gets home tomorrow."
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.
"If you hadn't brought him here, this wouldn't have happened."
This is my fault?
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.
- What is this?
- Just read it.
"Now I have to find Jess, and I have to make sure that he's okay... and if that cuts into your screaming time, that's just too damn bad."
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!
Not long after the accident happened...
"Luke walked him straight to the bus station... stuck the kid on the bus, sent him home to his mom."
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.
Okay.
Do you wanna come in?
All I know is that Jess is gone.
"Well, what will we do for entertainment around here?"
Beats the hell out of me.
- Where is this place?
You should say no
The first time you saw him was last night in the garden
You were scared and you called me
OK?
Why do I have to lie?
Because if you tell the truth they won't believe you
They don't believe in ghosts lt's our secret
OK?
Go to your room
is he dead?
He was already dead
That wasn't him
"Whoever it was, it wasn't him"
Then what was it?
"I couldn't let him torture you like that, Adèle"
What makes you think he's really dead?
What if he comes back again?
"If he does, I'll be here I'll always be here"
Do you believe me?
Come in. I've finished
- See you later
- See you
Hello
How are you feeling?
"Better, thanks I feel like I know you I was there when they took you away"
Give me your hand
Were you here while I was asleep?
I was keeping an eye on you
Just in case your attacker came back
"Thanks, Alcide"
You know my name?
"Yes, you told me when you came in"
And I would aid in the effort.
And be welcomed for it.
Come.
Keep him still until we return.
"A little wine, if seized by fit."
Drink.
Move Tullius' wine from sight.
"Apologies, Domina."
I would have permission to see Gannicus.
You ask this now?
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.
"I would have final words, before he departs."
I would share drink with an old friend.
Is that all I am?
A friend?
Gannicus...
I do not care for honey in my wine.
It serves only to mask bitter taste.
A blessing in such moments.
You are to be sold to Tullius.
Oenomaus warned of it should I fall to Crixus.
You let Crixus win.
Why would you do such a thing?
"Because I cannot stay within these walls, to gaze upon you every day and be denied your touch."
"I have never turned from challenge, yet I am without strength to face this one."
Then it is for the best.
"Because, despite my words,"
I stand as weak.
I want no wine.
Medicus gave order.
Drink.
Should help you rest.
She seduced me with Herman's picture.
Who are you talking about?
"About Christine, doctor."
Christine Halslag.
She's a witoh.
Everything checks.
She even has a numb spot on her back like the witohes in the middle ages.
It all connects.
Keep on talking... about witohes.
She killed them all!
Don't scoff at the poor girl's misfortunes. I've known her for years.
Those were tragic accidents.
Especially for her.
But these things happen!
Four accidents in a row is damn strange!
Use your head!
One plus one is still two!
Alright.
Then let me tell you how a physician sees you.
You turn a dead tourist into a giant with 30 grieving dwarfs.
You're a compulsive liar.
You lie the truth!
I heard you say so!
I diagnose an enlarged liver due to mild alcoholism and you're in shock.
Otherwise you're as healthy as a horse!
No!
She fucks you and finishes you off!
"Okay, I'll go along with you."
"He slept with her, you slept with her."
He is dead.
Why are you still alive?
- Because Mary helped me.
tell me something..
-Yes?
What is so special in this trunk..
..that you were ready to die for it?
should I?
This is that precious thing?
-Yes.
This is my sirs photograph.
Okay!
So this is the photograph of that great man..
..who accused you of theft and threw you out of the house.
"No, this is the photograph of that God.."
..who brought up a five year old helpless and orphan.
"Brother, what are you made up of?"
You still have so much respect forthis man?
"Friend, a God is always a God."
He is worshipped under all circumstances.
Whether he give happiness or sorrow to his devotee.
If you dont mind can I place my sirs photograph..
..next to your Gods?
"Wow, brother."
Wow!
Go.
"Sir, I really miss you."
I miss you a Iot.
Who must be taking care of you?
"Oh yes.. there is madam, little miss.."
..they will take good care of you.
"I wont come back, sir."
I wont come back.
"Its very simple, Jyoti."
I dont like it that I sit at home all day and you work.
Is that regulation?
I didn't know you government chaps carried those things.
Just beginning to filter through the Wooster brain that you're not government chaps.
"An amazing piece of detective work, Mr. Wooster."
"Here, sit down."
What are you doing?
"- Boss, you all right?"
- I don't know yet.
"From now on I shall hate ""The March of the Hussars. """
"Oh, we can't get out there."
Let's try here.
"Now, come on."
Come on.
Hurry up now.
I'm sorry to have messed this up.
I had no idea these people were thieves.
It seems you had no idea of anything.
"If it hadn't been for you, these men would be in the hands of the police."
- I'd do anything on earth to make amends.
- It's too late now.
- I'm not so sure.
- They match perfectly.
- These are the complete plans.
"- Well, I'm ready to leave."
What the—
- What's that?
"- Somebody playing games, probably."
They've got the plans.
Call everyone in the place.
Stop them!
"- Mr. Wooster, sir."
"- Jeeves, what are you doing here?"
Did he say that he loved you?
He had another woman there.
"Oh, tits."
"According to Dyson, we are only going to have sex when I need to heal."
But there was something there.
"I saw it, man."
"- God, he totally led you on."
"- It is not a big deal, okay?"
Let me go back to sleep.
I have the flu.
- Bo.
- Kenzi.
Kenzi.
"Bo, that disgusting feeling churning in your guts, that's not the flu."
"That's rejection, honey."
"Oh, my God."
"You have never been rejected before, have you?"
I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Okay.
Okay.
I am familiar with you wanting a guy and him not wanting you back.
"And heartbreak sucks, but there are ways to deal and I will show you how."
Or is our little Succubus gonna stay in bed forever?
No.
Okay.
"Telling Dyson how I feel, that was your idea."
This is your fault.
That is why I am gonna be there for you every step of the way.
- Including ice cream for breakfast.
"- Oh, joy."
"Look, dealing with rejection, it can be fun."
Well...
"Well, Mr Diamonds said, ""Hey, go take the afternoon off."
"""Take a few hours off."
"You deserve it."""
You know what that's called?
It's called esteem.
Esteem for loyalty.
"I mean, I don't..."
"I don't need time off, cos anything could happen when I'm not covering his back."
"He could be talking to other bodyguards, for instance."
"Yeah, right?"
"I mean, I'm not concerned as such, I'm not concerned, because, well, I'm..."
"I'm that guy, that one-in-a-thousand kind of a guy."
I'm that guy that will go the distance.
I will go all the way.
They no respect for the dead!
"They no respect for nothing, Michelangelo!"
"Dorothy, Bonnie, they pass on!"
Poor babies.
They just babies!
Like you!
"My daughter, yesterday night, she say she see what you doing on internet."
She say she see me speaking!
"She say, ""Mum, you are famous!"""
But I do not want to be famous!
I want to be invisible!
Invisible!
So you stop now.
"Right now, Michelangelo!"
"Child, you go home."
Please!
Pray to lord for souls of dead!
I'm not from earth.
The people looking for me are getting close.
They also are not from earth.
-What do you...
What do you mean you're not from earth?
I don't...
"- Listen, I care about you deeply."
- Then why are you telling me?
- To protect you.
"-Uh... your ...association with me, I fear I'm putting you in danger as well."
-Danger?
How can you... how can you expect me to believe this?
"Please, just... make me understand."
-Alyssa... there are things... there are worlds outside of this one you have no idea of.
And I am from one of these worlds.
I knew I would never see her again.
I was devastated.
But we are more connected than I even imagined.
She could hear my thoughts.
She could feel my pain in losing her.
-You were... telepathically linked?
-Yes.
Without my intention.
It just happened.
"Soon, we found each other again, and we left together, heading west."
- Then what happened?
- My worst fear.
They found us.
"I managed to get away unharmed, but she was not so fortunate."
-So you're saying that she's...
- Dead?
No.
Above the stairs...
I'll write you where I am in case something happens.
- What would happen?
"- I said ""in case""!"
And don't overstrain yourself now!
Drive careful and look after yourself.
Yes.
"And you look after our child, dear!"
Brennemann?
"Brennemann, wait a minute... he was such a nice young man from the East Zone..."
Görlitz!
"Yes, but where he ended up... that I don't know."
- Didn't he say something about Düsseldorf?
- Düsseldorf?
"Ah, now I recall."
"There were some old family heirlooms, destroyed in the bombings, that were deposited with us."
Now he has sold everything.
"Away with it, he said"
Brennemann!
"And I'll have you know that 23,50 Marks too much was incorrectly charged in storage fees."
"- Well, what do you say to that?"
That's my husband all over!
"What didn't belong to him, he did not want."
"It was here 4 months, but debt never lapses, he always said."
Because there's always a chance he'll return.
"Well, forget about it!"
What now?
I see!
Bruno!
"- Yes, what is it?"
- Come here!
"Oh, dear Lord!"
"Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check from FE Construction."
"Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check."
Who is this?
Um... is this FE Construction?
Yes.
I don't recognize your voice.
"I'm a lawyer representing... someone... uh, who has an un-cashed check from FE Construction, and she can't access her funds, uh, unless you reissue, so..."
Who's the check made out to?
Cash.
"Where are you calling from, lady?"
"Can you just reissue the check, sir?"
Sure.
Give me a check number.
"You know what, um, I'll call you back with that information."
Thank you.
Wow.
"Oh, hey, Cary."
- How are you doing?
- Good.
"You seem to be, too."
"Oh, it's just from being liaison to Eli Gold."
"As soon as he's back on the campaign trail,"
I'll be out there with everyone else.
Where are you?
I'm out there with everyone else.
"Well, then you'll have company."
Canning.
"Oh, Cary."
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
The Veriscene case-- we're in the middle of negotiations.
"Yeah, go for it."
It's okay.
Why are you saying she's my wife?
.
I don't even know her.
I know it's hard for you to believe.
But this is true.
Joy is your wife.
You love her so much.
Your memory will come back soon.
"But for the meantime, we're just here for you."
Recognize Joy.
So you will remember her.
...as her husband.
"Adel, is this serious?"
.
You had a speedy recovery Migs.
Just a little more therapy...
But expect some disorientation...
That's just a part of your recovery process.
"As of now sir, we just have to wait."
We can't tell when his memory will come back.
"What we can advise is, don't let him get too stressed."
"But Doc, what do we have to do?"
Those he can remember.
Why don't you and Migs stay over at our place for now?
.
In his room.
Because he might get more confused if you lived there in your new house.
We'll just go home.
I'm his wife.
I'll take care of him until his memory returns.
-But Joy...
He's required to call on the widow.
Is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
Standard  Poor's going to lower the city's credit rating.
We're going to close two firehouses.
Results: 150 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit to run the San Francisco Ballet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
- And a drug dealer.
- And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but he's very welcome."
"The stock exchange, where are they removing to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
- Los hermanos...
- The Geckos?
They can help you.
It's prophecy.
[slurping]
"Okay, okay, that's enough."
- [door opens]
- Did you hear that?
[man] Anybody home?
Ranger Gonzalez?
You in there?
"Well, it's about goddamn time."
I've been through hell and high water looking for you.
"Do me a favor, hon."
"You put that thing down, step on over here."
"- What are you doing here, Captain?"
- Shut your trap.
Slide your firearm.
This ain't a social call.
"Okay, okay."
Take it easy.
"Now, where the hell are those bonds?"
"I'm sorry, sir, what bonds?"
"Oh, don't get fresh with me, boy."
"You see, we found Tony Mendoza's car, and his GPS was all jacked up."
But hell if the techs still didn't still find that he was parked at your house the night he went missing.
So I got curious.
Turns out you borrowed four million dollars in bearer bonds from FBI Evidence.
"A federal offense, by the by."
So where the hell are those bonds?
"Okay, wait, you think I killed Tony?"
"And yet you come out here, all alone?"
"I mean, the Ark's in the hands of a fanatic who thinks that it's a cigar box."
And the key that opens it is a thousand miles away at the Royal Academy in London.
"MacGyver, i-is there a purpose behind these acrobatics?"
"Oh, I hope so."
Watch your eyes.
Bravo.
I always said you were my brightest student.
If only you had applied yourself at university.
Professor!
Quite right.
Carry on.
Looks like that gate's the only way out of here.
Come on.
Put this on.
What?
I'm not leaving without the Ark.
Professor--
"MacGyver, the Torch of Truth is in that Ark."
I'm not leaving without it.
All right.
Understood.
"The final shipment of arms is being unloaded now, Colonel Petrovic."
Good.
A schedule has been brought forward.
We attack in two hours.
"If the prisoners are spies, the U.N. forces may know of our plans."
We should strike at once.
Could these men be telling the truth?
That old chest-- It does not matter.
They are to be executed immediately.
Those barbarians must have tried to force it open.
Look.
"In looks I mean, and the way she talks."
I wouldn't love anyone with a character like mine.
"Charles, we're going to have a heavenly time alone."
"When, next morning, I saw Julia drive from the forecourt and disappear..."
"I felt a sense of liberation and peace such as I was to know... years later, when after a night of unrest the sirens sounded the ""All Clear'""."
I believed myself very close to heaven during those languid days at Brideshead.
It is thus I like to remember Sebastian... as he was that summer when we wandered alone through that enchanted palace.
Welcome!
Come inside please!
Come in and have a drink.
This way please.
Something's wrong.
They're too busy!
There's too many waiters!
White Tiger!
Give yourself up!
We'll get you!
There's no escape!
Bounty hunters from six provinces!
Seems like the end of the line for us.
Be careful!
Get us?
Never!
White Tiger!
White Tiger!
Split!
Mr. Huang...
What is it?
I'm there for the money.
Come in and get it.
I just scared him off.
"Dunkirk, evacuation of troops, trapped by the German advance."
700 fishing boats and the world maybe on a mission to bring our boys home.
"Twin sisters, took their father's cockaboat, and, joined the rescue and came back with a deck of soldiers."
It's everything the Ministry are after.
Authenticity and optimism.
"Contradiction in terms if you ask me, but, this could be a bloody good story."
"Before they will give it a go ahead, they want someone to go down there and talk to the girls."
Me?
Unless your artist object.
"So, how did you meet?"
Came in to avail steelworks.
Ah!
He's one of those artists.
Older than you?
Yes.
Fifty?
No!
Sixty!
?
Oh!
That is tough.
You can't afford to be an artist.
Actually his family dis-inherited him.
Because of you?
Because of his politics.
So what do you think?
They there at the sea-side.
"And you never know, if there's a film at the end of it, it might be a better job in it for you."
I need somebody to run the slob.
Slob?
Girl talk.
Woman's dialog.
Take it and get lost.
Five possible sniping positions.
"Sousuke Sagara, correct?"
Correct.
There is a taxi waiting at the north exit of the park.
Get in it.
Who asked you to do this?
Does this have some connection to the incidents occurring here?
State your name.
What would you do if I told you?
Sousuke Sagara.
Go to the second floor of the building behind you.
He is waiting for you in the back room there.
"Who is ""he""?"
I suggest you try to remember what this place is called.
Kowloon?
Yo!
"What has it been, three months?"
"I'm so glad to see you, Kashim."
Ga-Gauron!
You seem so completely shocked.
Is it really that strange that I'm still alive?
Back then...
You should've...
"Died, is that it?"
"I sure hope you haven't forgotten, now."
"My Codarl was equipped with a Lambda Driver, you know."
It can even protect the operator when the unit self-destructs.
"Well, I still ended up like this anyway."
"Hey, now."
Just look at the kind of condition I'm in.
I think it's pointless to be hasty.
To give you the satisfaction that you made your daughter as a Collector.
I could not believe all these when your daughter was saying it all to us.
But I am believing it now.
He risks anything if your family is touched.
What if I kill you in front of his eyes?
Sorry Ramachandra Rao!
You only showed me the dead body of my son.
But I will show you the death of your father.
I am giving you 15 minutes time.
It is your choice whether you save your father by joining him in hospital..
.. or save your girlfriend in our custody at the stud farm in that time.
You decide!
I am leaving this country now.
Good bye!
Karthik
Karthik
- Thanks for coming.
Sure.
What's he doing here?
Didn't they break up?
Two months ago.
Chill.
Tell him to go.
"This is a mourning, not a nightclub."
- You tell him.
- I will.
Don't you dare insult him.
- Want me to cancel my trip?
"- No, I'm fine."
I just hope they don't fall apart on me.
- Thanks.
- For what?
- Countdown to show time.
- Yeah.
"- Wait, seriously."
- Look at your little face.
Are you sure?
"This is for posterity, you know."
Okay.
"Anyway, here's my face."
- There's Ari's face.
- I love...
"This is why I love Norah and Caroline, because they love each other."
- It's very sweet.
- We love each other.
That's a cool shot.
It is rare that you get real female...
True female friendship in movies right now.
"Because usually what we get is, sort of, mean girl behavior."
- Yeah.
- It's so true.
"Even, you know..."
"- I'm sorry, you go."
"- No, you go."
"No, I was just gonna say that with Tris, too I feel like even though she come..."
"In certain moments, she comes across as being like you know, antagonistic to Norah or whatever."
But she's just as vulnerable as Norah and Caroline and just wants to be...
- She's human.
"...accepted, like everybody else."
- That's pathetic.
- She does...
It's not like they're never gonna see each other.
"I mean, they all go to school together."
"Caroline and Tris are friends, sort of."
Your Father Name:
Sivaratnam.
Your Grandfather Name:
Navaratnam.
- It seems Ratnam is the common capital for all.
Exactly..
This Maniratnam is a bonded slave to the family of Vasundhara Devi.
He is now here to find out a secret.
This is peaks to the peaks and is sensational.
Oh my god..
I remember by secret PK bro.
If required I will catch your feet.
You catch the hands of my wife.
Say whether there is someone else in her heart.
I helped so many people.
You are my friend.
Come!
What is this meaningless thing?
"Even if my sister agrees for this test, I will not agree."
My sister is like fire!
Who are you to agree?
Catch his hand.
Why do you just leave without saying anything?
I cannot break families by telling.
Ethics are wealth for me.
"No problem, tell."
My heart is like the granite.
Then listen this..
Another one is seen in your wife's life.
He is a very tall guy and dangerous man.
He stepped in a company as an employee and has married the daughter of the Chairman.
"Correct, right?"
Last I heard.
True story.
"- Oh, this was so cold."
- Yeah.
- It was raining too.
- Look at those boys.
How can you just not love them and wanna hang out?
Jonny's beatboxing was really funny.
"This was when the ""let me show you my balls"" thing happened."
"- Yeah, that was that night."
- Right there.
A guy wanted to show us his balls.
Didn't get to.
So a guy on our movie or some other dude?
- A drunk guy that was stumbling...
- A guy tried to show us his balls.
- Christo handled it perfectly.
- Christo and Self handled it.
- What did Christo do?
- Christo handled his balls.
"Christo is our first AD, who is..."
- Handsome.
- Handsome.
- Hand me some of that.
- And so sweet.
Gorgeous.
Ari.
"By the way, this pregnant lady actually threw up like in the left over where the chairs were, before we started shooting."
Threw up everywhere in between her legs and then just proceeded to sit there for 20 minutes with her and her boyfriend and nobody cleaned it up.
I feel like that was a good omen.
- This is the greatest...
- Ari.
You tried not to waste my time?
You think I'll be happy?
And that's being nice to me?
"You know, you wasted 3 good years."
We may not be together forever.
But we'll have happy memories.
We don't even have that now.
Look at me!
"No matter how many days you've left and the chance for the operation,"
I'll arrange for you.
Because I'll be here with you.
You're mine this time.
"Voice message to dad, press 1."
"Ask for money, press 2"
"Make an appointment, press 0"
Is Mr. Mak in?
Now!
"previously on ""jericho"""
Heather.
"Oh, my God."
We grew up together over in New Bern.
You just going to leave?
It won't be for very long.
"Johnston, you SOB."
How the hell did you lose an election?
No.
"The question is, how did you get to be in charge in New Bern?"
They get tired of you being the sheriff?
Can we buy some more of these things?
"Ten wind turbines for,let's say, ten percent of your spring crop."
"Okay, we'll give you the food."
Where does it go?
When it leaves?
In the inverter.
Then turn on the inverter.
This is a joke for you!
"We are also someone's child, we lose our memory."
"You made these bombs, Right?"
Yes Papa I made it.
I have a diploma for making bombs.
Now you'll die with this bomb.
"Tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Bomb is here..."
And you're using the remote from there.
Come inside the range.
Should I press it while standing on the bomb.
What kind bomb is this?
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Don't hit me."
"Don't doubt my talent, Bomb is fine."
I have a diploma.
Let me see the remote.
Here.
Battery is fitted wrong.
Now see how it blows...
"Now tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Chandi look at this diamond.
Our luck will also shine like this.
"After today, won't have to do this sales job."
We won't have to live in this car show room's wash room.
Won't have to listen to Laila Madam.
Let's runaway.
All right.
- Doc Swain.
- Hi.
"Evening, Selena."
Be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
Watch your feet.
Are you gonna tell them about me?
"- I'll have to, Selena."
- Nobody in town must ever know.
"- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
- I know that.
"- Well, then why?"
- Because of Ted.
"What are you afraid of, what he'll think?"
He loves you.
"It would ruin his life, married to a girl who... ."
Not a respectable person in town would accept him.
"""Respectable. "" What kind of respectability are you talking about?"
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
"Look, don't you understand?"
We're talking about your whole life.
Prison can be a kind of dying.
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"- Besides, you mustn't get involved."
- Never mind about me.
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
You don't seem to realize you face a possible life sentence.
That's right.
She's Supermac 88.
"Salute her, 99!"
How come everybody's more senior to me?
"Dumplings, you're..."
"Dad, where's your sense of history?"
Many heros place righteousness above family.
I shouldn't have give birth to you!
Tell them to drop their arms!
Don't mind me.
"For the Emperor, get the 'Beast'!"
If all Chinese were like you.
Where would we be today?
How can we fight one another?
When we're faced with a common enemy?
"If you can kill your own people, go right ahead."
What's the matter?
We want to become women!
We could easily run out of men!
Why don't you give me a chance to become woman too?
Father!
This story is getting too female chauvinistic!
Can I have the Formula now?
Get rid of them!
I'll give this to the American for you.
"My mission is completed, I'll go wherever you go."
"Yoyo, you can't come with me!"
Why not?
Because I've promised him.
Him?
I feel sorry for you too!
"Robin, thanks for coming to see me off!"
"Sir, you are watching, arent you?"
I know that you might be very happy.
But you might be thinking why..
..your Krishna didnt come back.
Just few more days.
We are destined to stay away forjust few more days.
III definitely fulfill the promise that..
"..I made to sister-in-Iaw, sir."
III definitely come back.
III definitely..
"III definitely come back, sir."
You dont know what this acting can do to me?
Otherwise the day will arrive when all the..
..girls will queue up for my autograph and you..
..wont even get chance to come near me!
How did I spend my day?
And the nights too?
O beloved dont ask me..
..about the severaIty!
O beloved dont ask me..
..about the severaIty!
How did I spend my day?
And the nights too?
O beloved dont ask me..
..about the severaIty!
O beloved dont ask me..
..about the severaIty!
"darling, I missed you everyday!"
"finally, I met you after so many days!"
"darling, I missed you everyday!"
"finally, I met you after so many days!"
Whenever I had missed you!
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
It's the guy you'd hire.
"Look, you remember Emilio?"
"Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
Okay?
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
"And then, poof."
Dude is like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough you don't want a criminal lawyer."
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger is way too loyal to roll.
"Plus, he's scared shitless of me, all right."
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap so, worst-case scenario, you know, they plead him out."
He does five months picking up litter in an orange jump suit.
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
"We'll flip for it, all right?"
Call it.
- What?
- For my father.
Don't tell him I was with you.
"Wait, wait."
I'll take you.
"- No, we're going to take the tram."
- When will we meet up?
In two days.
In the same place as always.
Will you think about me?
I will.
I'd love to show you the youth of today.
"You can't imagine how different they are... they're better, they have revolution in their blood."
If only Trotsky and Lenin had known that.
Trotsky was a filthy traitor.
"Imagine what your mother would say if she heard you talk that way... about someone you never met, and someone who has passed away at that."
Mund...
"Sir, I want to go to Munich."
What for?
There's food here.
"Doctor, my head hurts."
Do you have something?
"No, I'm very sorry."
I don't have anything.
"- The Geneva Convention, prisioner."
- Mund...
The gentlemen will say that they're in good health...
- there's nothing to complain about.
- This prisoner has appealed...
- to the Geneva Convention.
- He's got no case at all...
- that idiot refuses to eat.
As you want.
"In the worst moments, Julian used to draw his silhouette with his finger."
He'd repeat it... over and over.
I didn't know what to say.
When you met..
What did Julian say?
We talked a bit about everything.
He told me what happened to him.
And about me?
That you were nice to him.
Nothing else?
"Also, what happened between you two."
He didn't look very affected that day.
It's true.
Shall we leave?
Do I look good?
Very good.
"The day he met you, he came home radiant."
The only important thing to him was that you wouldn't realize how happy he was for seeing you.
Do you know why he chose my poem to compose?
I thought he could've wrote it.
Specially the last verses.
"""And with hands trembling..."""
How was it?
"""With hands trembling by tenderness""."
He said you wrote it thinking of Clara.
Who knows.
I'm sure.
How is she?
I guess she's fine.
You and Clara broke up on time.
I was determined to leave Julian when he'd go out of the sanitarium.
I'm such a mess...
"On the other hand, I'm sure you chose right."
You're fine.
That's what the doctor says.
But it's not true.
You know I've always envied your job?
The music?
To me it's like magic.
Of course I have a terrible hearing.
There's nothing to envy about.
"It's just a hobby, not a job."
The composer who doesn't perform is nothing but an amateur.
I thought you were fine in Germany.
Yes...
Well that was before the sanitarium.
What sanitarium?
Didn't you know?
Everybody knows it!
I spent two years in a madhouse.
I didn't know at all.
Yes.
But what happened to you?
I had a screw loose I guess.
But know you feel better?
"Besides, you know, the crazy ones are the most intelligent."
It's a shame that no one else thinks that way.
You shouldn't care.
"Of course I care, unfortunately."
"Well, I'm fine now."
I have a couple of projects.
Even though I only need an orchestra.
But apart from that I'm practicing some songs.
I always mix that up.
Mm-hmm.
"Anyway, I suddenly found myself needing a G-7 encryption form."
Which are very hard to come by.
Try impossible.
But there was one left.
And as I'm reaching for it... this.. force of nature beats me to it.
"I mean, we laugh about it now, but the rest, as they say, is history."
I hate couples.
You asked how we met.
"Granted, you kind of had to be there."
"Oh, no."
"No, not you guys."
You're great.
Just couples in general.
"The Jamaican resort I went to last Christmas, it was couples only."
And you were flying solo?
Changed my perspective.
Couples everywhere.
It was crazy.
Look at this airport-- it's got every variety.
Like those guys--
Self-Important Pete and his Electric Lady.
"Course, they haven't spoken directly to each other since the brownout of '06."
Then there's those two--
Daddy Issues Debbie and her college professor Marty Midlife-- teaching her all he knows about advanced economics
- and the Kama Sutra.
- Wait.
"Tony, that's no couple."
They're clearly father and daughter.
Think so?
Yeah.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
"You want your exponential growth, guys are gonna get busted."
Simple as that.
So how about we get him a real attorney?
"I mean, what the hell is this?"
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
- It's the guy you'd hire.
"- Look, you remember Emilio?"
"This dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
And then poof!
Dude's like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don't want a criminal lawyer."
All right?
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger's way too loyal to roll.
And then it keeps on splitting wider and wider
When it hits each successive bird 'cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way.
- Good.
So--so what... does the sword...do?
The blade in this particular sword
Is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path
And goes around the person holding it.
"Um, are we--are we talking about, um, invisibility?"
Mm.
Kind of.
In effect.
"No, the person's still there."
"Although, you know, the light that we see"
"Doesn't hit-- yes, invisibility."
Awesome.
I knew-
- I knew that was possible.
I knew it.
Okay.
Invisible swords now...
"Hey, Artie, these are-- these are the same sword, right?"
- Yeah.
- They don't match.
What?
"Well, you see, disc thing that's attached to the grip--"
"Well, it's in the painting, but it's not in the sword"
From the dig site.
It's missing its tsuba.
"This piece right here is called a ""tsuba."""
"It's actually a collectible in its own right,"
"You know, separate from the sword."
But this is missing its tsuba.
- Or he wanted us...
"- Oh, man."
I remember that.
- He made me...
I smelled something.
- Everyone had to do it.
- We all had to do it.
- That's so right.
"And then, like, there were times where in the bathroom scene you were like, ""Girls, it's a great opportunity for like bathroom humor."""
"- Oh, my God."
"- And we were all like, ""What?"""
It was 5 in the morning and the three of us looked at you:
"""No, we're not gonna do that."""
I think it's relatable to an audience to witness someone else smell something bad.
"- Oh, God."
- It is.
Think about it.
I remember talking to you about this when you're like:
"""Why is it my instinct to make someone else smell something bad?"""
Right.
"And then inevitably somebody says, ""Here, smell this."""
Speaking of smelly things.
- How did you feel about this foot...
"- Oh, God."
- Nice one.
"- Oh, Alexis' foot, doesn't..."
- She's an extremely pleasant...
"- That's her real foot, right?"
- That's a stunt foot.
- Right.
"- No, that's really Alexis' foot."
- That's an Alexis foot.
Where do you hail from?
Suburban narcotics squad.
Sick of smashing syringes?
You could say that.
"Klein is sulking, stay with him."
Don't chat with the enemy.
We're enemies?
"bri/OCU, it's an old rivalry."
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.
She's private property.
Klein's?
Who else?
How could you be pals with him?
He wasn't always like this.
Their names?
Winterstein.
Bruno and Rolf.
The one who did me was Bruno.
Christo warned me:
"""Your big mouth will get you in trouble."""
Now it has.
"7 vans in 1 8 months 9 conveyors slaughtered, and a 2 million Euro booty."
The Ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo.
"Asking us, and I quote:"
"""to tackle the problem head on"
"""and neutralize the criminals"
"""who've derided our forces for too long."""
"""Too long"" is bad!"
"Means we've been around for too long, doing nothing!"
As of today you're on duty 24 hours a day!
"Drop your personal problems, don't laze on Sundays, go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time!"
Larry King.
Yeah.
Or any of those shows.
That's right.
And you can usually find us at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs.
Most times.
"My name is Will, and this is Dale."
And we've been through a lot ofheavy stuff in that truck before.
"- Monster madness, dude."
- Major monster madness.
"- Gentlemen, please."
- What?
But-But...
- We're not fooling around!
We're not fooling around!
- Get in the back.
Sometimes you got to take the bull by the horns!
We're American citizens!
And there you have it.
Who says the great American hero is a thing of the past?
"- Back to you, Rocky..."
"- I hope you can see this, Bill and Wendy."
It's like a circus down there.
"You know, Byron, it's easy for us reporting this story... to forget there's a very scared little girl inside that car."
"We can only imagine, as this chase continues... the horror young Natalie Voss is experiencing right now."
"Oh, shit."
- Just-Just hold still.
- It stings.
- Mm!
- I don't want it to get infected.
- I'm so sorry about this.
- As you should be.
Chad we barely go out in daylight as it is.
Come on!
I'm starting to feel like a vampire.
"- Besides, we didn't do anything wrong."
- I know.
"But Kev, I'm in this guy's sights."
"There are better options than laying low, believe me."
We can call Dan Silk.
Threaten him.
"No offense, but I don't think you could take him."
Pummeling this guy wouldn't do much for my public image.
I mean we could threaten him with legal action.
- It's true.
"- I'm a lawyer, truth is irrelevant."
I do this all the time.
"I need to make it clear, if he doesn't print a retraction, he'll face a very lengthy lawsuit."
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions.
It's Lawyering 101.
I've never seen you so...
litigious.
- Right.
- It's kind of hot.
- But no way can you call him.
- Why not?
He's not a major corporation.
He's one guy.
He's one loser.
He'll cave.
They all do.
Believe me.
No.
We just need to let it blow over.
"You know, I think"
Henry and I should have the same last name.
"Yeah, I'm cool with that."
Henry Chase.
No.
Henry Krawchuck.
What do you mean?
"Well, what I mean is, I know I took a couple months to get back to you on your marriage proposal."
"The offer's still valid, right?"
Four more minutes.
"Well, the answer is yes."
So we're engaged.
Yeah.
"Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you, but how long do you want to wait before we have kids?"
Stay back!
What's going on?
What just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
"Oh, my God!"
Total 911!
Goblins have stormed our kitchen and they are eating all our sugar pops.
Tell them the milk has gone bad.
Was someone kept up late by a doggy-style celebration of love?
A little...all night long?
"I want all the hairy details, okay?"
"Okay, no."
"No details, hairy or otherwise."
I feel like crap.
Didn't you see Dyson last night?
- Yes.
"- Okay, well did you tell him you wanted him to be your boyfriend?"
But I'm talking ANL Sydney.
Not Melbourne.
Not Melbourne.

There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans.
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.

We can expose U.S. Forces... secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
[Elizabeth] It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.

- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
- Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by... and they call the police when we're in the camp?
No one hikes around here.
- Philip.
- Come on.
"Come on, buddy."
[Engine Off]
Let's go.
I look like Kermit the frog.
"Oh, God."
"Artie, stop doing that!"
"Yeah, I gotta tell you, Myka, those really bring out your eyes."
"This is a, uh, 14th century Chinese firework"
Known as an ice flower.
Very few-- very few like it left.
Now...
"Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this, all right?"
"All right, we've got about ten minutes, more or less."
Let's go.
The light pattern triggers a feedback loop
In the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer.
They won't remember a thing.
Booga-booga.
"Whoa, freaky McFreakerson."
So it's some sort of reverse chemical reaction?
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, take these off."
Just don't look directly through the window.
This was made by an implosion grenade.
It removes matter from the center of a space
And pulls everything-- Obviously everything--
Directly towards it with violent force.
This explains why they couldn't find the sword.
It could be in there.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no."
"No. the sword, long gone."
Stolen.
This was used by the thief as a cover.
- So the guy that I saw--
And thought why don't I come to your home... drink water in your house and... break their bones here.
Sir you know...
Don't interfere!
What do I care?
- All I want is to...
- Get water out.
Welcome Tauji.
I've invited him here specially... to tell him about your deeds.
And show him too.
Your man's taken our contract... and he's been beating up our men... instead of doing our job.
Enough!
My rule is we can sacrifice our kin... but never fail from completing a contract.
Sometimes... we make a mistake.
In life we often make small mistakes... as well as big ones.
They are 3D villains.
3 generous villains.
They gave me one chance to catch that scoundrel.
They'll give me a second chance.
Third... fourth... fifth...
Stop it.
Are you going to keep running after him all your life?
Mr. Pradhan.
Contract cancel.
What did you say?
What did you say?
We cancel the contract we gave you.
Cancel!
Cancel!
Cancel!
Uncle you heard.
They cancelled the contract.
When the contract's canceled... there's no question of betraying.
Mood:
"- Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed."
- You're histerical.
I'm used to hanging out with these people too long.
- It catches on.
- Totally.
I like to stay away from the fashion car when I'm not working.
"But it's so incestuous, everybody is doing everybody else."
They feel like they don't get to miss out or something like that.
- It's pathetic.
"- Listen, I gotta get back to work... before I get fired, but maybe we could grab a drink after?"
"I'd love to, but unfortunately my day doesn't end here."
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Great.
"There's this cool band named Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's... it's like some disco, some funk, interested?"
"- Sounds fabulous, I'd love to."
- Cool.
And definitely bring that silly putty.
I'm all over that.
- Time to take your places!
- I'm not ready yet.
I'm still in make up.
"See, Chi Chi?"
I told you.
I don't work like this.
- Supermodels.
- I know.
Attendance!
"I needs standants, standants, you..."
- spritzer girl.
- Did I hear my name?
Go stand at the top of the balcony.
"What's that, Larry?"
You want to show your appreciation somehow?
I suppose I could do that.
"After all, it would be rude of me to turn down a..."
"Oh, Larry, small but eager."
I'm going to need a serviette.
Hmmmm...
"Ah, thank God for rigamortis."
Councillors.
I eat you.
Brother.
Brother.
"I'm feeling really good, Sam."
Full of hope.
My spirit bear put me through an exercise program.
"Really worked my core, eh?"
"Good morning,"
I have and important announcement which will change the outcome of this trial.
Oh...
This may be very good for us.
I think we're gonna get a retrial.
"I'm beginning trust you, Sam Murray."
As you know someone has stolen my first and second-string gavels.
Now today my wife needs the hammer that I've been using as my third-string gavel for one of her projects.
Bird house.
"Which is all to say, you're looking at it:"
Today's gavel.
"All right, look, look."
It's just gonna have to do.
What a travesty this is turning into.
"Your honour, may I approach the bench?"
Yes.
- where are you headed?
- to what i promised the last ghost i would do.
- [scoffs] clean up your mama's shop?
"no, you ain't."
- [scoffs] [snaps fingers]
- this ain't right.
this ain't the salon.
- this is like -  scrapbooking place.
- what the heck?
"- it looks god-awful, don't it?"
"[laughs] [coughs, laughs]"
"- hey, i know that laugh."
i know that laugh!
mama.
- [clicks tongue]
- you look terrible.
- well...
- what's up with the creepy black robe?
"- robe's part of the tradition for, uh, ghosts of christmas future."
"anyway, after you married wayne, you sold the place to bob and marge."
you never did get no job.
"- [scoffs] well, i actually think it looks kind of nice."
"- oh, you like the way this looks?"
it looks like a magazine or something.
it's got no soul.
"i mean, honey, look what you let happen to the salon that i built with my own hands."
- it's quaint!
- yeah.
then marge went even hog-wild after she got it all in the divorce.
- wait -- bob and marge got a divorce?
- yeah.
- see?
"I was, uh, behind enemy lines in France."
"First, it doesn't feel like anything."
Adrenaline's good that way.
"Then, it was burning."
White hot.
I was trying to help a family of Jews.
Police didn't like that.
You know about the Jews?
About the Nazi Master Plan?
All those trains taking them East every day.
"They're not being ""resettled."""
They're being exterminated.
Five thousand Jews per train.
Ten trains per day.
You do the math.
"Your father, he's in charge of running the train schedules for the German Transport Ministry, right?"
He's very good at his job.
Very efficient.
How'd you get captured?
My plane was shot down.
You survived.
What about your crew?
I always wanted to learn how to fly.
Must be something up there.
"Everything looking so small, like tiny little pieces on a board game."
It's not a game.
"Real men, dying every day."
"And I'm being moved from camp to camp, for what?"
- It doesn't make sense anymore.
- You won't eat.
- Why are you still fighting?
- I fight for my country.
- How do you know?
- I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one.
And everybody was talking about it.
Let's get ours.
- We can't.
- Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe..."
What?
"Again, Vi?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
- We got it.
- What...
"He said it was an easy gig, right?"
- Yea.
"- Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me Daisy."
I know what we said.
"but, we've changed our mind and we thought... we considered your offer."
"And we think, that actually it'd work out quite well because um..."
"See, the day that you talked about..."
"Deeper baby, deeper..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
"Like I've end up better do with it, Princess."
Are you guys hear about this guy?
"Ok so basically, there was this guy who stole some shit from Chet."
- What did this guy take from him?
- A truck full of cologne.
"Gosh, he's a big one."
Good grief.
"So what's the plan then, what do we do?"
"We will try to measure them, we will tie them up and then..."
So you kind of hog-tie them and then attach some device...
A GPS device?
Radio telemetry.
"Right, radio telemetry."
Shall we try?
You can try.
"You can feel it, can't you?"
It's being hog-tied.
It's like a chicken when you...
Measurement's beginning now.
Head width 14.5.
Follow the line of the tail.
Two and 2/3 metres - wow!
What's the next stage?
The next stage is to attach the transmitter.
"We'll see, it's probably thick enough."
That's working.
So this is fine tune.
"OK, keep the leg like this, even though it's already released."
It's a tough animal.
And then we release them in the three count like that.
"One, two, three and then everybody just go!"
"Right, OK, ready."
"Wait a second, we've just got rope on the..."
Just undoing the tape around the...
Just undoing the tape on the snout.
Got it.
Unwind.
Shut up!
I got this one!
- Roldy?
- Please don't!
"I am in a great amount of pain, sir!"
Everybody relax.
Just calm down.
Everything is under control.
Tell 'em to turn the plane around.
These two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.
Secretary Fox.
Glad you could make it.
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?
Not a fuckin' chance.
Who are these people?
Representatives of the different intelligence agencies.
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?
Negative.
He's on an ice fishing trip in Glacier Bay.
I'm in charge while he's gone.
"Well, shouldn't he be alerted?"
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?
Who are you again?
"Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA."
"Yeah, well, listen, Dr..."
Dipshit.
You've obviously never been ice fishing before.
"- No, I haven't."
"- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating."
The last thing anyone would want while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.
Now back off... and let me do my job.
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?
Sire.
The palace has canceled Our King.
"Ludovic, we are the Palace."
Anything he has filmed will be censored.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lloyd."
But think a little.
His story and my film will never see the light.
"Once again, my footage was being thrown away forever."
But I could not blame him.
"After all, a king has no fate in his hand."
"At least, so I thought."
"Yes, that's fine, but we have to agree with Turkish security."
"Yes, our versions must coincide."
Nobody knows.
"Well, no one knew about the king's identity."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Sire, I have the official version proposed by the Palace."
"We left Istanbul yesterday, accompanied by Turkish security."
And our escape in the Balkans has never happened.
Mr. Duncan Lloyd?
"I, King Nicolas III, King of Belgium..."
I authorize her to do what she wants
With all the pictures and sounds
Which he recorded from the day we were at Mini Europe.
"Any pictures, sire?"
Yup.
Are you sure?
Agree.
His Majesty.
Do you think this trip is due to chance or destiny?
It must be fate.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defence that money can buy.
"Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
It's on your head.
You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
You want your exponential growth guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?
- Isn't there something you'd like to say?
- There sure is.
"Kids, you tried your best, and you failed miserably."
"The lesson is, never try."
[ Laughing ] Right in the butt.
- That was great.
- [ Angry Grumbling ]
It's no use.
I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council.
"Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
"Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
"Oh, look."
A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction.
"- I think it's a rock, sir."
- We'll see what the lab has to say about that.
[ Glass Shattering ]
"Why, that rapscallion is breaking all my windows."
[ Sinister Chuckling ]
- [ Excited Shouting ] - [ Doorbell Ringing ]
"[ Chuckling ] Look, Smithers."
A creature of pure malevolence.
He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.
"You there, boy!"
What day is this?
"[ British Accent ] Today, sir?"
"Why, it's Christmas Day."
- I was talking to him.
"You, what day is this?"
- Huh?
I'll tell you what day it is.
Today is the day you become my heir.
- [ Bart Grunts ] - [ Groans ]
Then leave the rest of the world for me.
"What, Muraaki?"
Can you only fight?
Only the one who can fight can love.
Can fight for love.
Can die for love.
What is going to happen tonight?
Is the sky going crazy?
Don't question nature.
This is happening..
..because you are about to belong to me forever and forever.
Such a ferocious storm happens only once in a thousand years.
There will be only one Saiba and Jilaan in a thousand years.
The moon shall yield a sword.
You are the moon and I am a dark night.
How did I get so attached to you?
Trust your heart.
Does your heart beat to my name?
How would it?
Muraakis don't possess a heart.
Saiba belongs to me.
And she shall always belong to me.
I had said so.
You shall die in Paathar's waters.
So Muraakis don't possess a heart?
We gave you a heart and then stabbed it.
We killed you with deceit.
Saiba did.
"No trust, no love."
"Don't commit this sin, Kaabir."
Don't.
It is no sin to kill for love.
Athos saw me.
There's no going back now.
"My dear fellow, that would be treason and foolhardy."
Louis is already dying.
"I hope you are not having doubts, Feron?"
You are asking me to kill my own brother!
"If you don't, then he will discover your betrayal and hang you."
"And if he doesn't, I will hang you!"
Thank you.
You will kill Aramis and the King.
Very well.
(LAUGHS)
"Now we found a nice spot in the shade, we can wait."
Properly.
"Come on, come on."
"That's it, good... (WHISPERS) Please be good, please be good, please be good."
(SNIFFS)
"Oh, this could turn out to be a good day after all."
I imagine the General's aide will be a little while longer yet.
(LAUGHS)
"How many battles did we fight, eh?"
(CHUCKLES)
- Too many.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
"We've served our country, often and well."
"So if we are rewarded with the odd mission like this,"
I won't complain.
"In that case, I'd like to propose a toast."
"To easy missions, well earned."
To easy missions well earned.
Ooh.
No more shakes.
Fine!
Force me to live with this obscene obesity.
"You know, Aunt Zelda is so unfair."
"I know it seems unfair now, but someday when you're older and wiser, you'll be able to look back on all this and get revenge."
Hey... one more shake wouldn't hurt and it would be wrong to waste perfectly good guar gum.
"Hilda, here's an interesting news item."
"""Everything Emporium president missing."""
"Oh, look, Larry King likes the new Ludlum novel."
Did you have anything to do with this?
No.
Robert Ludlum has his own publicist.
"Oh, you mean the Everything Emporium president?"
Yes.
"He was bugging me, so I turned him into one."
Ginger beer?
A bug?
"Hilda, you've got to change him back."
He is in a perfectly humane situation now that I gave him air holes.
SABRINA:
I wonder if that last milk shake made any difference.
I certainly feel lighter.
"Salem, help!"
I've disappeared!
(gasps):
I'm so sorry.
"Hey, twirl me around so it looks like I'm flying."
SABRINA:
What's happened?
!
Where am I?
!
"He had a passion, a transmitted lustfulness,... a feeling which I had never experienced before."
-Are you still there?
-Yes.
-Are you alone?
"-Yes, but only momentarily."
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
Your husband?
"-A peasant, but he's not here now."
-It's better that way.
Let's take advantage of that.
Touch yourself and imagine it to be my hand that fondles your sexy bits.
He was stronger than me and emerged spontaneously to satisfy... the unknown and the unseen.
I don't know.
"Are you doing it, Rosella?"
-Yes.
-Bravo.
"You are getting your caresses from me, you know."
-What are you touching?
-My breasts within my blouse.
-On top of my bra.
-Bring them out.
Moisten your fingertips with saliva... and wet your nipples.
Do you like it?
It is my hand that plays with you.
"-Tell me, if you like it."
"-Yes, I like it."
"Very good, continue and pretend that it is my hand, that fondles you."
Bloody hell!
"Rosella, my love, let me feel how wet you are between your legs."
"Feel it, my love."
My fingers just slipped into your panties.
- and you...
"- Will hate you, like I've always hated you."
"Patience, Mr. Hall."
All our teams need to act simultaneously.
I think that's a comet or something.
"It's a meteorite, in point of fact."
I was drawn to it as well.
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?
When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.
"Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here."
"Professor, Jax, we need you."
"Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was."
Look.
What do you mean you don't have the money?
I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profit.
- Things changed.
- You expect me to just hand the meteor over for free?
"No, I expected to take it from you by force."
Ah.
Well...
I think that's our cue.
Really?
These guys again?
Now.
Keep them occupied.
You ready to show these fools what's really good?
You have no idea.
Glad we're past the point of worrying about the timeline.
Carter!
"Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the particulars of the agency I work for and all that, that implies."
"You mean, uh, national security?"
(CHUCKLES) Let's put it this way.
"Every once in a while, things happen that just can't be rationalized in a conventional way."
People wanna know that their government has a response.
I am that response.
"So, were there any witnesses?"
"Well, sir, if you'll just follow me."
- (METAL CLANKING)
- We did find this.
MARV:
"United States Government, huh?"
"Guess that means something big's happening here, eh?"
"No, Marv."
Big things happen in big places.
"And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... (CHUCKLES)"
Biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"- Come on, Marv."
Come on.
- MARV:
Okay.
I need a witness.
It's around the corner.
Come on.
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.
I've never seen anything like it.
"It's like a big, big ""chomp"""
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...
Did a cop tell you that?
We need to get to the guy first.
He's in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Étoile d'Agadir.
You don't answer questions any more?
"Fuck, Gilou, I'm fighting for you!"
You want to end up in jail?
Let's go.
"Arnaud, are you aware that as an intern, you are allowed to follow a police investigation in the field?"
"Yes, I know."
"Our relationship being what it is, I suggest you take this opportunity."
"Thank you, but I'd rather stay here."
And I have seen enough of you.
You are starting tomorrow.
They are informed of your arrival.
"- Is everything all right, Marianne?"
"- It's nothing, Your Honour."
It's just the shelf collapsing.
"Wait, let me take care of it."
My husband has a safe in a bank on the Champs-Elysées...
"Average height, short dark hair."
Stocky.
This is a peaceful hotel.
I don't want any trouble.
"Please, answer."
"OK, your colleagues came yesterday."
Yesterday?
- Yes.
They took the man you're looking for.
What was his name?
He called himself Mr Bo.
Thank you.
- Say some things you don't like.
- Shut up.
- I'm bored!
"- Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill.
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
Makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
"That's the undercover's wife, Caroline Risdale."
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her but there's only thing that comes before a lady.
Me dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
"I'll get us something to eat, then we can work in shifts."
- Why?
- Because I may garrotte you myself.
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
- What kind of bag?
- I dunno.
A bag bag.
"- A suitcase, an overnight bag...?"
- That's it.
An overnight bag.
He goes out for a jog like you said and... he comes back out with a bag.
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
- Did he see you?
It's an act of love.
It's the divine mystery itself.
"You must think I'm inexperienced, but I assure you,"
I was baptised in the brothels of Paris when I first arrived.
"But, um..."
"I'm so ill, and I have been for such a long time, and my body is such a great disappointment to me that I've already said goodbye to it."
I'm not really in it any more.
I'm just happier floating about in music.
"And if I should come back inside this miserable collection of bones, then I am afraid that it would probably collapse altogether."
Forgive me.
- I am ashamed.
"- No, no."
Forgive me.
"I'm a fraud, you know."
Divine mystery!
I've never experienced that with anyone.
I've always had disastrous relationships.
- I've never managed to stay in love.
- Why?
I don't know.
I want too much.
I think.
Except when I hear you play.
And when I'm around you.
Look...
I simply want to be with you.
The rest doesn't matter.
Really.
Do you think we could just...
be together?
Like this?
Yes.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
"Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"Come on, man."
How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"No, those are actually always there... something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
NineNine!
"Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
You lose me my customers.
Where else can I park?
Where the engineer's parked.
You choke us when you start it up.
We swallow fumes instead of tea.
I park right here.
You can't.
You have no right.
"It's my cafe, my territory."
You can't park your car here.
What's wrong?
Park where the engineer's parked.
What's going on?
"It's my cafe, my territory."
Leave him alone...
Mind your own business.
"I go to a lot of trouble, I work."
Serving tea isn't that tiring!
There's a difference.
My tea relaxes you.
Who takes care of me?
Are you tired?
I'm the one who's exhausted.
"I've been out harvesting in the blazing sun, in the full heat of summer."
is serving tea that tiring?
So I'm not working?
I don't make efforts?
Your work isn't all that counts.
Remember the first day that you served tea to your future husband.
You appreciated it and so did he.
Those days shouldn't be over now.
You have to remember that day for the tea...
"And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants."
It goes back tomorrow.
"Skyler, it will crush him."
That car directly contradicts our story.
"And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story."
"What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?"
What about Hank and Marie?
How about the IRS?
"What were you thinking, Walt?"
I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
[scoff]
Look.
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
"Oh, he will."
"Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that."
[sigh]
"But you know what, Walt?"
Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.
Dead on Arrival
Kobe Port
Where's Deacon Frost?
In the Philippines.
(SCREECHING)
"So how the devil have you been, Eric?"
You've gotten a bit rusty since last I saw you.
BLADE:
"Noah's stiff the same, I see."
Only more so.
He's not exactly mellowing with age.
(DOG WHIMPERING)
Razor.
College is gonna be so much fun!
Totes.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history."
You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
"...family, too..."
"Hey, is that your mom again?"
...if you're desperate....
"Someone needs your help, Michael."
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
"That's how we do it, people."
"Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere."
Put the weapon down.
Hands on your head!
"Listen to me, Michael."
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
"Michael, what happened?"
"Card's dead, Fi."
Now we need a way out of here.
- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.
It was his.
Son of a bitch never did anything without a plan.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.
What are you doing with your hand?
"Maybe he wanted us to, you know, be partners."
Think I'm going to be sick.
I think Snart knew.
"He knew that I'd keep an eye out for you, and you'd keep an eye out for me."
While doing what?
What we haven't finished doing.
What was H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?
- Bertie.
- Incredible.
You've gotten every answer correct tonight.
Since when did you become such a history buff?
I guess I developed a passion for it recently.
During your sabbatical?
You hardly ever talk about it.
Martin?
"I know, I'm sorry."
"My sabbatical was, um..."
I left some very important work unfinished.
"Ship's not going to be here, Gray."
"We saw it take off, remember?"
"Yes, and in doing so, it would have left..."
Quantum signature.
That's what I've been trying to tell Mick.
- Radio beacon.
- Quantum entangler.
It's a meeting about having me replaced on the ticket.
I know how to count to 270.
"John, I assure you..."
"I assure you that if it were a serious notion, we would..."
- Texas is gone.
So is Florida.
- We're not doing it.
- You should think about it.
- Are you taking your name off that bill?
Nobody benefits from the Internet right now more than the rural poor.
You're taking your name off.
We can't campaign on it.
"- Yes, sir."
- And if somebody's attacking us you know what to do.
I call Leo.
"Yeah, but don't discount the possibility that it might be Leo."
"Yes, sir."
"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you a little more than you thought I did."
But that's not why you're staying.
It's this.
Four words.
I've always liked you more than you thought I did too.
"Just a little, right?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Me too.
Anything else?
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"- Thank you, sir."
Charlie!
"- Yes, sir."
- Let's go.
I'm a magic man.
"A buddy, someone who cares."
Joey?
You ever have... your best friend...
stab you in the back?
Not since the army became my best friend.
You ever... suddenly feel that you're...
lost... that there's no place left for you to go?
I used to.
That was before the army became my home.
- Oh.
Really?
- Sure.
Think about it.
"The army feeds you, clothes you... gives you a place to sleep."
Every guy in khaki is family.
"Oh, that's... beautiful, Joey."
- The army is beautiful.
- To the army.
Max... you've got character.
- I wouldn't make this offer to just anybody.
- What kind of an offer?
What you need is an anchor... something that won't run out on you.
You know what I'm talking about?
The army.
[Chuckling] Hey.
"You're way ahead of me, Max."
Did you ever think about reenlisting?
Where do I sign?
"Okay, I got somethin' to tell ya... and I don't wanna hear so much as a titter, a snicker..."
- or a guffaw from anyone.
"- You hear that, Charles?"
The subject of this meeting is... the army.
Find anything?
I've been over the entire school twice.
No sulphur.
"No sulphur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.
"Well, it happens to the best of us."
"I say we hit the road, huh?"
But after lunch.
It's sloppy-jo day.
"Good hustle, Colby!"
Walk it off!
"Hey, I need to copy of your algebra homework again."
Hey!
Why?
"'Cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick?"
"I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak."
- That fist?
- Yeah.
What happened?
How's the nonviolence assembly going?
"Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisine art is not a healthy display of anger."
"So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?"
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit.
It's got to be ghost possession.
"Yeah, but that's pretty rare."
"Yeah, but it happens."
"I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body."
"All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
Ruins with artifacts that have this kind of power are all over the world.
Spriggan!
What's that?
Look!
The ark!
Damn...
It's over.
Wake up Ominae!
you jerk.
Jean.
What?
I'm way too easy going.
I can still see that brat's dying face in my mind.
but that's what I like about you.
What did you say?
Just shut up hang on.
What's that?
!
That is the true figure of the ark.
The ark is breaking up!
It can't be!
We couldn't even scratch the thing!
Something must have been activated to have caused this!
Four thousand years of time... and returned to the void.
what about Yu and Jean?
look.
Yu!
You're alive!
The King's New Grammar School in Stratford upon Avon... where over 400 years ago a young lad named William Shakespeare... poured over his classical literature and history... and began to learn about the great names and events that had shaped the world.
"Today, Stratford has changed."
It's still the cozy market town of Shakespeare's day... but it has also become the epicenter of the 'Shakespeare World'.
"I know who you are, so it's okay."
Who do you want to interview?
"I'd like to interview you, actually."
- Is it okay with you?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Well, okay, then."
But I'm answering only the ones I can.
Nothing too personal.
- I appreciate this.
"- No, it's my pleasure."
- Sounds fun.
- Thank you.
Do you trust people easily?
I'm a little over thirty now.
I changed when I passed thirty.
I used to trust people easily.
"Back then, I had to define everything that I do."
"But after thirty, I loosened up."
"If I can't define things right away,"
"I just think some day I will, and take it easy."
"Wow, we're really different."
"I've been uptight since second grade, and haven't rested ever since."
Do you like dogs?
- Who doesn't?
- I'm afraid of them.
What do you believe in?
Have anything you have absolute faith in?
"- Yes, myself."
- You believe in yourself?
I think only about myself.
"I'm not perfect, but it's still me."
It's up to me to improve myself.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Answer me!
Why are we here?
No one should live like this.
Drugged in a fucking tank!
It's for your own good.
it's not!
You're waiting for me to die.
I don't wanna fight but there's things we need to discuss.
What things?
would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
It's what the guy gave me.
Wasn't in a position to make demands.
I almost died this morning.
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.
You're less affected.
You know he needs a higher dose.
And I know you got more money squirreled away.
That money's to get us out of here.
not us.
You and him.
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.
"Sun"" is the keyword."
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.
Do you?
and making him spotted dick.
Found this in your pocket.
Adamantium.
I thought he was a cop.
He drove by a few times.
He never got out of the car.
Sorry.
I wish I could be more help.
"Yeah, well, actually, you know what, you can."
What are you doing?
"This is one of those video doorbells that record you, right?"
"Yes, it is."
Do you know how much that thing cost me?
A lot.
They're very expensive.
"But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story."
Thank you very much for this.
Hey.
"Honey, let's go home."
It's late.
Mm-hmm.
I'm almost finished.
I'm gonna be done in a second.
"Oh, no, you won't."
Do not tell me that you are operating on a silverfish.
"Well, it's more like a scenic journey through his digestive tract."
Okay.
I'll be in my office.
"Hold on, Angie."
Look what I found.
Oh.
"Wow, that's actually kind of beautiful."
Right?
"So, this is just the sort of saccharide most silverfish love to munch on."
"In this case, it's a highly magnified particulate of professional grade acoustic foam."
-The power of Christ compels you.
He brought you low by his blood-stained cross!
"Do not despise my command, because you know me to be a sinner."
It is God himself who commands you.
The majestic Christ who commands you.
"God, the Father, commands you."
"God, the Son, commands you."
"God, the Holy Spirit, commands you."
The mystery of the cross commands you.
The blood of the martyrs commands you.
"Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers."
You're guilty before almighty God.
Guilty before his son.
Guilty before the whole human race.
"It is the Lord who expels you he who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world, by fire."
Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
Why?
Why?
No.
No.
"Dimmy, why you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
"If my guess is right, his next victim is here amongst us."
- Who?
- You only!
"You gave an interview to TV9 channel, right?"
Is there any rule that your guess will come true?
He took charge and shot him.
Check thoroughly and kill without missing him.
"All your search is in vain, because I'm his next target."
He'll definitely come for me.
"I shot a bullet into him, right?"
He likes challenge.
He'll definitely counter attack me.
"Somebody gave this for you, sir."
"I'm going to rob Rs.20 crores from him in an hour, be ware!"
"We have an hour only, we must find who is he."
Inform all TV channels.
Fast!
Who is he?
Doctor?
Politician?
Who are you man?
I'm a peon in Revenue office.
Remember that while doing your duty.
It seems you refused to do household work.
Why are you so proud?
"Sir, madam..."
"Don't talk, go get me a tea."
Rs.20 crores?
!
Who is the mad man to say that?
"We don't have time, tell us the truth."
"I beg you sir, please leave me."
I will go get my earplugs.
- Where's your owner?
"- Hi, Olivia."
- Hi.
- I don't have an owner.
- Olivia.
- Good to see you.
I hope you're not back for an encore because last night was a one-time thing.
"No, you left me quite depleted."
I could barely walk.
"- So, what's up?"
- I have a problem.
I hear you have special skills for hire.
They are.
Let's talk rates.
"Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Kenzi."
"So, what's the job?"
I want you to kill someone.
And that's gonna cost extra.
"When you mate for life, and your life is centuries you make it work."
So you invite other Fae into bed whenever you get bored.
Keeps things exciting.
"But we've had a rule, no snacking behind each other's backs."
- Naturally.
- What happened?
Samir and I own an event-planning business.
The girl's a florist we used on one occasion.
Her name's Jenny.
So Samir couldn't keep his hands off the help?
That's typical.
- I didn't know he was shucking around.
- Shucking?
I must see to the sentries.
"Excuse me, ladies."
When will you pay me
Says the bells of Old Bailey
When I grow rich
Says the bells of Shoreditch
When will the...
"Oi, blimey!"
- Sh!
"Is that you in the dress, sir?"
Nice.
"- Give me your picklock, Cooper."
"- Picklock, sir?"
Catch me with a picklock?
They did.
"But when you got out of Newgate prison, you got another set."
- That's the one the officer wants.
- Come on!
"Do I get it back, sir?"
Trust me.
"It's very hard to trust a man who wants to borrow your picklock, sir."
So...
You could not wait until Torrecastro
"Very well, you shall hear the story."
A thousand years ago the Muslims swept across Spain orn their way to Rome
My ancestors made a stand in these mountains at a hard rock we call Torrecastro.
They were many.
We were few.
We died hard.
"At sunset my ancestor dying called on Sant'lago, St James, the saint of Spain."
Sant'lago came.
"He came with a banner of blood and a bright sword, and he slew the invaders in their thousands."
Henry.
(HENRY GROANS)
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
(THUD5)
ESTELLE:
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
AKAN:
I love how protective you are of me.
Mmm...
You owe me an apology.
For?
Doubting me.
I did have certain apprehensions.
Then Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
(GASPS) ls everybody dead?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
(SNIFFING) Ah.
(CHUCKLES)
"VVe1lhave a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will wake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you as well but... that was the last of the bacon.
Are they always this noisy upstairs?
I like it.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So, what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry.
I forget you need a bit of extra help sometimes.
Yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison.
Do you remember that?
You were nearly garroted.
"Oh, that!"
They wouldn't have gone through with it really.
"Just their idea of a little kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way."
Turns up.
"Doesn't always knock, either."
"So, make sure you're not doing any washing up naked."
"You'll be wanting to see your sister after this, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
Is that allowed?
Course it is.
Which together with your brothers missile trade with cocaine?
Coca push to make the road and the money washed them to become construction materials for guinea pigs.
"And that hog André the Secretary,"
"Simon and Venini in there, where?"
Simon is untouchable!
It is not the flow from dirty sewer rats!
Of sewer rats?
This I brings to mind a bath.
There is a pool here?
The joint construction passing through the Bank of Polo Red ...
Spring bank and give me the banker!
What does the banker well as the banker to do?
Go to the Bois with the German dachshund?
Medium rare?
Al dente?
At the point right?
Overcooked?
The theater has been put baldracca with an actress.
You could tell us what is your name?
"Aglaé, gia, gia!"
This information you saved my skin.
"Unfortunately for you, Marie gave you goodnight."
- Can I do anything for you?
- Noo ...
Why do you show this?
Because you are my friend!
You know what I want?
You know what I feel?
Just now I was about to tell you I have a conviction.
Servant to someone?
A nothing.
Sprofondo.
And Mary's.
Sharpening my chompers and waiting for wonders.
"I'll ship your miserly, meagre coffin back."
I don't like you.
It's because of her.
"She's deranged, she feels the cold."
What's eating you up...
"Shut your trap, Mr. Innocent!"
Don't forget that I'm being generous to you!
Just like the Police at home!
Do you want to feel my trotter?
A big portion of Parisian pig trotter?
Braised too?
Thrash him out!
His stupid suitcase too!
In case he falls over even more.
You still in one piece?
"It's my fault, I shouldn't have left you all by yourself."
I like it raw.
But I would like it to get raw for me.
Curse you.
"Mary, full of ice,"
"The Lord is against thee,"
"Punished art thou among women, and punished is the fruit of thy womb."
Nergal!
15 rue Nergal!
"Follow the guide, my prince!"
"Without me, you'll never find the path to passion."
Isn't it what you want?
Mickey has a bone to pick with you.
"The bone, i love that."
The bone and marrow...
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
- How'd you do?
"- Well, I got an A."
- Professor Rosa...
"- Micky, please."
Is there a problem with my paper?
"Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking."
"Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight."
"So, is this some kind of a math club?"
"Don't be rude, people."
- Kianna.
- Fisher.
- Choi.
- Jill.
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.
"No, really?"
"Well, it's really simple, actually."
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
"If you go over, you lose."
"If the dealer goes over, they lose."
It's the most popular card game in the world.
It's a game with memory.
"Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future."
"And the best part, it's beatable."
Are you talking about counting cards?
No.
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
S  P's lowering the city's credit rating.
We're gonna close two firehouses.
Result: 1 50 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit...
... toruntheSan FranciscoBallet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
-And a drug dealer.
-And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but..."
... he'sverywelcome.
"Where is the stock exchange moving to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"-No argument, Lenny."
-And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
I believe it is.
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(LAUGHING)
"Because you don't have the facts, sir."
(CHUCKLING)
Wait a minute.
You're gonna love it.
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
I don't know why you started laughing.
Here.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(WARD LAUGHING)
"I'm just silly, sir, but that machine, that is really fantastic."
"How much, roughly, would a thing like that cost?"
"Oh, about $3,000."
"Not counting the camera, of course."
Three thousand?
Dollars?
"Why, I can get a new car for that."
Not that I need one.
"Lieutenant, you have something to say to me, don't you?"
"Yes, sir."
"I'm really sorry to bother you like this, sir."
But just a couple of questions before my report on Sid Daley.
"It doesn't look like he could have done it, sir."
He was with a girl and she confirmed it.
- Not if you're gonna call it‎. ‎
"- I told you‎, it's your nickname‎."
I told you not want a nickname‎.
Cut it‎!
That's your nickname‎.
"You know‎, like the song:"
"""Oh‎, Danny boy‎,‎.‎.‎."""
That's an Irish song‎.
"I'm not Irish‎, nor my ancestors‎."
Come rájate with gum‎.
Thank you‎.
"Do you feel better‎, sir‎?"
"Now I can see where we go‎, much better‎."
"Well‎, as you can see let me give tourism‎."
"Welcome to ""Empty""‎."
"Killing 1‎,000 miles‎."
"After our troops crossed the line‎, they moved like 15 millaspor day‎."
These are the remains‎.
We can go home and the people of this country gets to see this‎.
Like driving trucks‎?
"As they say‎, it's better than being in the back of the bus‎."
Sorry‎.
I'm not familiar with that term‎.
It's what the bus drivers told us in America‎.
"Blacks had to be at the end of the bus‎, even if it were empty‎."
What kind of behavior is that‎?
In me it seems fair‎.
"That I say‎, sir‎."
What happened there later‎?
Back off‎!
¡Let's go‎!
"¡Vamos‎, walking‎!"
We have got hundreds...
"As you can see, the military's moving into position but won't advance because of safety concerns for the hostages."
"--Obvious to everyone, this is the work of al Qaeda or some like-minded Arab terrorist group."
- The National Guard...
- The building's buttoned up.
Rooftop's secure.
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.
"- Apparently, we're all Arabs."
- Good.
- Cake?
"- No, I don't want cake."
I'm diabetic.
Hallelujah.
This is my Graceland!
Sweet Shiva.
Sugary pops of delight.
"Come on, let's go!"
Move!
"Let's go, sheeple."
"Now, welcome to my house."
"Now, sit down and shut up!"
"Oh, baby, I've missed you."
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Skip Tyler has arrived."
"By the time you're watching this, I will have pulled off the greatest hack the world has ever seen."
"This is difficult for some, it is but for me, it's as easy as one, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
Yes.
Showtime!
"Oh, some latecomers."
Secretary of Homeland Security is in the house!
"-Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration."
"Oh, my baby, my baby."
would you Iike some pop?
Honey.
Pop?
Not with my nerves tonight.
"Scotch for me, please."
Grape.
You haven't asked me how I got away from school before the spring term ended.
I thought you'd volunteer that information if you wanted to tell me.
-You thought I'd been fired?
-No.
I thought you might have resigned.
"Oh, I was so exhausted by all I'd been through, my nerves broke."
"I was on the verge of lunacy, almost."
So Mr. Graves--
Mr. Graves is the high school superintendent.
Thank you.
He suggested I--
I take a leave of absence.
I couldn't put all those details into the wire.
This buzzes right through me and feels so good.
-would you Iike another?
-One's my limit.
You haven't said a word about my appearance.
-You look just fine.
-God love you for a liar.
daylight never exposed so total a ruin.
But you-- You put on some weight.
Yes.
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.
Your Picassos and Bacons and those fellas who paint your ceilings.
I know those guys.
Doughnut economics!
50/50!
"The cake for you, the hole for everybody else!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, hello!"
The Middle East!
Flat-packed atomic bombs!
Nerve gas!
"School-kid soldiers minced in the swamps, between Iran and the other one!"
Our export figures look so good in the National Assembly reports!
And I being a zero!
"- No, the other one."
- Sorry.
- So what now?
Go straight to the hilt?
Right.
I'm doing this by the numbers!
"The price of the Queen, like in Shake-a-spear."
"You must have ran into a book, now that you're no longer working the streets."
Nobody surrenders a Queen.
"You have to take her, you buy her, you have to deserve her."
"Come on, all together!"
"""O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,"
"""How are thy leaves so verdant!"""
Were you talking about me?
My love.
But I'm worthless!
My Queen!
"Excuse my lateness, I was drowning in Ministry paperwork!"
And what the fuck are you doing here?
"And what about you, you, you!"
Self-affirming.
"Well, so you really need that written on your chest?"
You don't already know it?
"No, I don't already know I'm a precious, wondrous... special, unique, divine, rare, valuable, whole... sacred, total, complete, entitled, worthy and deserving person."
I don't know that.
Menswear is the other side of the escalator.
- Over here?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Doyou have any glue?
"- Oh, we have Shoe Goo."
"- Yeah, that might work."
We have to hold this for one to two minutes.
"So, how's the separation going?"
Orwas that temporary?
Maybe even momentary?
"No, we're really separated."
But we have two kids.
Okay.
How old are they?
It's a real madhouse in here.
It's 'cause of the sale we're having.
"Well, go if you need to go."
How did you do that?
"Oh, well, do you want the long version or the short version?"
The long one.
"I was trying to save my life, and it didn'twork."
What's the short one?
I burned it.
And when doyou get to take that off?
I don't know.
I think when it stops hurting.
- A teenage waste of space.
- A name would be nice.
"It would, wouldn't it?"
You ask a lot of questions.
Why did you compel that man to kill himself after he told me to stop looking for you?
Dramatic impact.
Wish it would've been more effective.
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.
It's just part of being what I am.
"No, it's not."
I know other vampires.
That's not true.
You mean your boyfriend over there by the pool table?
Stefan Salvatore.
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?
Or do you enjoy them both like Katherine did?
- We should be in there.
- No.
Isobel made it clear we're not to step foot inside.
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
"- You're not gonna kill her, period."
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?
She's my wife.
Was.
Was my wife.
"I looked for the woman I married, but she wasn't there."
Whoever that is is cold and detached.
- Yeah.
- She's given up her humanity.
Why would he call me?
"Even if he calls, I'm not ready to talk to him."
Please.
Don't get furious.
"Even when he had was blind, he was peaceful."
Now everything has turned upside-down.
Why are you telling me this?
Varun left for Kanyakumari all of a sudden.
He didn't share any further details.
He has not been picking my calls either.
I'm confused.
And worried.
So I called you.
"Sorry, aunt."
Don't call me hereafter regarding him.
I'll get it repaired.
"This Alphonse can fix all phones, don't worry."
Okay.
I'll leave.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?
No call from the number you mentioned got completed.
From Manoj's number?
Yes.
"Unless the call gets completed, I can't find the number Manoj has been dialling."
I checked the date you mentioned.
"After the 17th, there are no incoming or outgoing calls to and from the number."
"But before the 17th, calls have been made and received to and from a specific number."
I eve have it written down somewhere.
Here it is.
7599... 447333.
You'll leave her alone?
- Yeah!
Meltem said you know me?
"Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance."
This is getting exciting.
I know your father.I'm his partner.
Shit.
"- Hey, don't worry."
I'm here alone.
Let me go.
"Let her go, will ya!"
"- Shut up, okay?"
I'm not going back.
- You know you're father's almost cracking up.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh man.
Shit.
Want some chewing gum?
"Here, they make the best bubbles."
What kind of cop are you anyway?
A new reform-oriented generation.
We're civilian friendly and practise painless police brutality.
Hey?
Are you gonna tell me what happened back then?
I heard about your mother's accident.
My father totally cracked up.
He just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him.
"There was always a reason, a motive."
"Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap."
Then he started observing me even more than ever.
He'd secretly watch me on my way home from school...
"I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love."
I did for a good reason.
But it has gone wrong.
Let Manoj's deal get finished.
I'll give your fair share.
"Only if we are united, we can cheat others."
"If we cheat amongst ourselves, we will not prosper."
Got it?
Don't share this with uncle.
I'll draft a plan for Manoj and let you know.
Let's go to the hospital and then leave.
"In the route from Kanyakumari to Nagercoil, these 3 trees are our mark."
You wait here.
I'll give a missed call while I come close...
You set a scarecrow looking like a human in the middle of the road.
"I'll hit the scarecrow, and act as though I'd hit a man."
Then you have to lie on the road like a dead man.
Definitely he will get scared.
He will try to run away from the spot.
"Then you clear the spot, and leave the place."
The plan is perfect.
"Hey, please..."
"Ashwini, what happened?"
!
What happened?
Tell me!
Ashwini!
What happened?
Where are you?
"Ashwini, where are you?"
Ashwini!
"Ashwini, what happened?"
"He's dead, Manoj."
"If you disagree, I'll file an emergency appeal."
We'll drag this thing out forever.
We can talk about it all day if you want.
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
Okay.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Your Honor... we respectfully ask for time to consider filing a motion to preclude this testimony.
I respectfully deny your request.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Now!
So I got to put my ass in the hot seat now?
- He has nothing.
- [click]
Really?
"You sure of that, huh, Donald?"
I am.
What if he does have something?
- [click]
- Huh?
You know what I suggest?
I'd suggest we give these fuckers
$10 million and get this over with now.
"Try not to be stupid, Wendell."
Lord knows you're capable of it.
And don't go weak on me after all I've done for you.
[scoff] Donald--
After all you've done for me.
- [clicking]
- You condescending asshole.
How about the nearly billion dollars in fees we've paid you over the years?
"When you illegally tested and developed items to get a jump on the market,"
- Don't sound upset about it.
- Up to level 12.
"Turn that off, disturbs the patients."
"- Frank, what'd I miss?"
- County HHS needs to talk to you.
"- Ditto, Human Resources."
- Anything from Dr. Romano?
"He called half an hour ago, an hour before that."
Somebody from Dr. Rydell's office called to confirm your appointment-
"Frank, 2 needs a janitor."
What the hell is this?
Why is Stella Willits still on the board?
I called to have her admitted to Psych hours ago.
- I haven't evaluated her yet.
- Save yourself the trouble.
She's nuts.
She's a frequent flyer with a history of bogus medical complaints.
"With all due respect, I'd like to determine that myself."
The ER doesn't have time or manpower to deal with hypochondriacs.
That's what you' re for.
Get her off my board.
- It's part-
"- I said, get rid of her."
Stubborn.
Gotta give you that.
- How are those medical students coming?
- Fine.
I gave them three volumes of Rosen.
ER.
"Carter, Urology on two."
Think you can come up with something a bit more interactive?
Yeah.
"Love comes, love goes"
NO BEGGING OR MUSIC PLAYING ALLOWED
It wafts in on the breeze and then it's gone
No one makes a big fuss over love these days
You get along or you slug it out
A day is like a year...
"Miss, take some change out of my pocket."
I can't reach my piggy bank.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
Put the rest back now.
A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
"See, I didn't steal any."
Then reach in again.
Your fiancé isn't as old as he looks either.
What's going on here?
Good thing that sign says you're blind or no one would know.
Mind your own business.
I'm just doing my job.
Better guide your music director back to his chair.
Meet me at 5:00 at the fountain in Friedrichshain Park.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can do anything about it
So here we are.
"Yes, here we are."
So you think we should be organ grinders?
Were you in the war?
And how!
- What's your name?
- Me?
"Biberkopf, Franz."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
He will not return.
Varun knows everything.
"If he'd come here to catch me, even after seeing me, why didn't he come to me?"
Why should he follow me?
"That simple means, he has no concrete evidence so far."
He won't get any evidence hereafter as well.
But...
The important thing is that he should not reach Vikram at any point.
Vikram.
- Priya.
I guess you can sense that I'm not fine.
"Priya, don't worry."
I am not able to...
My mind is not at peace.
"Tomorrow, everything should go well."
The organ dealer should properly arrange everything.
The transplant for my brother should go well.
"With all these things running in my mind,"
I'm not able to stay normal.
I don't think I can stay alone here.
"If you are with me,"
I'll feel better.
I've been feeling the same way since I dropped you.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I'll come there right away.
I'll be with you till everything ends well.
Okay?
"Thanks, Vikram."
Sir.
- Hey!
Where had you gone?
I thought we agreed --
"Listen, sister, if I'm gonna be living in a hut in the Dominican Republic,"
I at least need a decent bottle of scotch.
I believe that's the sound of my scotch arriving.
"Hey, beautiful."
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it took so long.
There was construction.
It slowed everything down.
Construction?
Where?
At the entrance to the marina.
What?
Is -- is there a problem?
There's a reason fugitives are so paranoid.
"When you're on the run, even the smallest change in your environment can put you on high alert."
"But, then again, sometimes being paranoid pays off."
Damn it!
That's an earpiece!
"See, this is bad."
Those are agency guys.
We're blown.
"Yep, that's a gun."
My I.D. guy -- he was acting all jumpy.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself.
I should have known.
They'll start searching as soon as they block the marina.
We got to go now.
"Well, we aren't getting out of here by sea."
Coast Guard is incoming.
"Fi, get Mike and Jesse."
I'm on it.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye!
You don't have to leave right off!
You just think over.
Help yourself.
- Thanks.
"Please, be careful with this."
It's fragile.
Would you mind?
- Thanks.
It's nothing special.
"I will show you, don't worry."
I told you I was a land surveyor.
This here is a theodolite.
I look through this every once in a while.
I only need to keep it unnoticed.
Why?
- I don't want them to think I'm some kind of a spy.
Have I shown you the bathroom?
- No.
"It's dilapidated, as you see."
There's no need to repair it now.
You won't have to walk through my room.
"Be sure that you lock yourself when you use the bathroom, they may break in."
I haven't told you...
Do you know that this house is going to be torn down in a month?
Of course I do.
"Why did you insist to live here, then?"
Sentimentality and other things.
I told you.
"When this happens, I'll manage myself somewhere else."
You won't have any troubles with me.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try now."
We need to find him.
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
Alright.
Good.
Now concentrate.
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the East."
"Alright, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett!"
"- Medical research, not really my thing."
- And hunting Wraith?
"I mean, I could stay help Beckett."
Never could get into biology.
This is too much information about the human body.
"One time, when I was an undergrad, I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions, before I had to drop the class."
Really?
Yeah.
"Believe it or not, back then I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
"You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration."
What?
Am I bothering you?
Maybe I'll go get some air.
This must be the river she saw in her vision.
Assuming she's telling the truth.
"Just cos there's another Wraith, doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her."
"What's on your mind, gorgeous?"
"- Oh, just wanted to say hello."
- Really?
That's sweet.
"'Cause the last time we chatted, I believe you threatened to kill me."
"Gee, has something changed since then?"
"You really did out smart us, didn't you?"
Screwed us royally.
"- I'm impressed, Dick."
- I'm like a lion that way.
"I hide in the weeds, bide my time, then i jump out and tear the ass off some dumb buffalo."
Ooh.
"So, Mr. Lion, how are you gonna cash in that ticket?"
I'll think of something.
Don't lose any sleep over it.
"Believe me, honey, i sleep like a baby, 'cause the second you try to cash in that little fucker,"
I'm going to the lottery commission and tell them everything.
"If you did that, I'd rat you out quicker than a frog can take a piss."
Mmm.
- What do you want?
- Halfsies.
Half.
Have you been exercising?
'Cause you look great.
Deal.
Nothing like rekindling an old friendship.
"Hey, that's him."
Wagstaff.
- Wagstaff?
"- Yes, Wagstaff."
Are you sure?
"Light hair, 6'2' lives here."
-She must be a very special woman.
-Yes.
"I'm here, Alyssa."
Where are you?
Why don't you answer me?
"-Welcome, Mr. Casey."
-Check him.
"-And who, may I ask, are you?"
-Marek
Thai is Trea.
-Let me guess:
Draconians?
-We are.
"-Well, then I'm certainly not pleased to meet you."
-It's clean where I found this.
"-Whatever your reason is for coming here, understand we have no intention nor interest in keeping you alive."
"-So I'm dead either way, right?"
-Correct.
No one will be spared.
-Why?
-The Earth's position in the solar system provides us with a strategic and tactile advantage.
"-Robert, the human role in the universe is inconsequential."
"-That may be so, but we have a right to exist."
-Only if we allow it.
-And we don't.
"-Well, before you start waving your victory flag, might I suggest examining the contents of the drive you hold in your hand?"
I think you'll find it very consequential.
-Alright.
Take him.
"And Robert,"
Jaelen had something we very much want.
It's a Grey stone that contains crystals.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please.
So the guy was choked to death.
"You sure, Doc?"
"Yes, absolutely."
"Not only that, it appears it was done with one hand... someone"
With a very strong right hand.
So you're saying that he was choked
By a guy using just one hand?
Yeah.
"There was severe damage to the larynx, the esophagus."
There's no doubt it was strangulation.
That doesn't make sense.
"Broad daylight, no robbery."
"And if there was an assault, why didn't the dog bark?"
I can't solve the case.
I can only tell you how the young man died.
"Not a single person heard a damn thing,"
And yet there were people all around.
"Hey, Doc."
Is it possible that... that a girl could have strangled him?
"On, the top my head I'd say no."
The hand print on his throat was too large for most women.
And I doubt if any woman would have that much strength.
Why do you ask?
"Oh, hell, I'm grasping at anything, Doc."
"I mean, he was with a girl."
It was her dog.
Thank you.
Yes.
"Now, just to recap, you've almost killed yourself..."
Right.
"...So far, you've lost a competition that you came up with."
Yes.
I cannot to see what you've got planned next.
It's actually pretty cool.
- Have you ever heard of range anxiety?
- I have.
"That is when you're more than 1 mile from a waffle house, right?"
[ Laughter ] No!
That is not what range anxiety is.
I'm just saying.
Range anxiety is where people who drive electric cars start to get nervous that their car won't have enough battery life to get them to their destination.
Okay.
"So, the other day, I'm watching the movie ""Top Gun,"""
and it hits me.
I know how to end range anxiety forever.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Here's all I need.
"I need a retro-fitted electric British sports car, a power cable, a generator, a pick-up, and..."
Adam Ferrara.
[ Laughter ]
That's Adam Ferrara?
Yep.
No.
"No, no."
[ Laughter ]
Now it's Adam Ferrara.
I thought the best place to conduct my experiment would be an airport runway in Compton.
Let's get clear of this god-forsaken place.
Let's go!
We need to drink.Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We have been pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
You're going to leave us here?
"I could make my life a lot easier and return you to jacob moore, if you would prefer."
"Soon as we clear the rocks, boom the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry.
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
But I have nothing to lose.
Which makes me far more dangerous!
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You're going to attack me with a stick, are ya?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
"Oh, well we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
- Gao Jian
"Oh, it's you!"
How come you're here?
Cause I miss you all!
How is Master!
It ain't good to talk here.
Let's go in
"Brother, try these noodles!"
Go on!
"3rd Bro, we haven't seen each other for a year"
Did you change your profession?
It's a long story!
We're now at the mercy of others
We are at the end of our tethers
Y et there's no end to our insults
You're not much better than us!
That's right!
Ever since the three bastards came 3rd Brother has become the chef
"I'm the servant, and Sister is the housekeeper"
"Hey, looks like you've been doing well"
"You here to do your brothers a good turn, is it"
"Shame on me, I'm not much better than you"
What are you doing now?
"Speak up, chap"
I'm waiting on tables
A waiter?
The noodles are for me!
No wonder Master wrote you off as a useless bum
As the saying goes :
can't change one's nature
"What did you say, kid?"
Nothing!
- Doc.
- Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean,Lex Luthor.Case in point."
"Hey,psycho."
"Hey,psycho.What's up?"
BOMB SQUAD
You switch to decaf yet?
Not a chance.I got nine lives.Haven't burned through half of 'em yet.
"Oh,right.Well,uh..."
This is some ugly-looking shrapnel.
Ugly and old.
Like FDR old or bush 41 old?
I'm thinking somewhere in between.But this puppy's been modified.
- Who are you?
- Soto.Civilian authority.
Pulled that from a tree branch.
So he's putting something in them.
"Yeah,most of these whack jobs add ball bearings,nails,whatever's handy, put 'em in the mines to maximize carnage."
"This doesn't look like some random piece of metal.You mind if I,uh..."
- knock yourself out.
- Thanks.
You want one of me too?
Recording bombing victim number six.
severe lower body trauma.Powder burns extending to mid-torso.
- Becca.
- Hey.
"- Hey,how's it going?"
- l hear you went to the dark side.
Federal task force.Yeah.I'm working the pine street bombings.
"- l'm her partner,Dr.Diego Soto."
- Hey.
"It's, like, Ludlow and Stanton."
I didn't realize that my ass was gonna be...
"- Ari, your ass."
- There it is.
It's so beautiful.
"- Goddamn you, Kat."
"- Does she say, ""My ass is in the air?"""
I remember you saying that.
"You really, really look like you..."
- Jesus.
"- You guys, I'm fine."
"That was like a big stunt, right?"
The timing of that was tough.
"With them pulling the door, and didn't it..."
It was tough and Ari ate that door a couple of times.
Yeah.
You're dedicated to your art.
Was that a take where she actually hit her head?
- I don't think so.
- Looks pretty convincing.
I think it's just the sound effect that makes it so powerful.
"- There they are, off into the night."
- I'm actually driving.
"- Yeah, and..."
- It died a bunch of times.
"Do you have any assemblies of those takes in the blooper reel at all, Pete?"
- Of Mike stalling the Yugo?
- Yeah.
"- No, I don't have them."
- The Yugo just slowing to a stop.
- No.
"- Are you doing, like, a blooper reel?"
Great.
But what I'm getting at is what were the autopsy results?
Why do you people keep making me relive this nightmare?
Because you're the coroner!
Good point.
What was the cause of death?
Cause?
"Well, um..."
"Sir, there are so many causes of death nowadays."
"Um, murder, disease, loneliness - that's the real killer."
That's what finally got the roadrunner.
"Your honour, the witness is really pissing me off!"
"Mr. Diamond, answer the question."
"Well, I would if he would stop misleading me."
Come on!
What was the cause of death?
What?
What got him?
What?
"Come on, what was the cause of death?"
What was the cause of death?
"Well, I don't know the cause of death."
Because I never finished the autopsy.
There!
Satisfied?
"Fine, we'll just have to do it again."
This is good.
I'm ordering that the body of Mayor Bowman be exhumed first thing in the morning.
Very good.
"Oh, it's gonna be gross."
It's gonna be disgusting.
Is that the ring for the tipster hotline or the suicide hotline?
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us, and I knew even then that you were different."
Your father has raised you well.
He has taught you right from wrong.
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try."
"Now, we need to find him."
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
All right.
Good.
"Now, concentrate."
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the east."
"All right, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett."
"Uh, medical research is not really my thing."
And hunting wraith?
"But, I mean, I can stay..."
and help Beckett.
Never could get into biology.
There's just too much information about the human body.
"One time, I took it as an undergrad,"
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.
Really.
"Yeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
Come on.
Open the door.
"Open the door, please."
"Come on, Rose."
What are you doing here?
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?
What happened?
Is it Gregory?
"I don't want to say I told you so, but..."
- Mom.
- What?
"When I was a baby, did you think I was pretty?"
All babies are pretty.
"No, I mean me."
You must have thought something about how I looked.
And who will undergo such fantastic plastic surgery?
Only a faceless old folk will do it
"King of no face, you bastard !"
I hate others to cheat me by pretending as woman !
Especially disguising as such pretty woman to seduce me!
Luckily Fat is so smart!
He disclosed your secret
Your Majesty
Don`t move
Don`t trust him !
"He wanted to screw me so he brushed his wife off, and he even beated his wife up in front of me"
"He isn`t a man at all ln order to trap you , my family performed a show in front of you"
Dear audience
The best actress
"In this play, she acted ..."
"... verywellthat, no matter..."
I shall dispose of you myself !
"You like scaring people, pal ?"
Why don't you let me show you how it feels ?
- It's Storm !
The rings !
"If she damages them further, she'll undo all she healed !"
Polemachus will be devastated !
"Storm, stop !"
Please !
"Storm, listen to me !"
What you're doing is wrong !
"If you want this dirt pile to still be here in the morning, friend,"
I'd get us some of those glowing golf balls right now !
You'll hurt innocent people !
Arkon's making you act against everything you believe in !
"Please, Storm, he's not worth it !"
You are right.
Forgive me.
"Come on, let's get out of here."
Storm !
Please !
"Storm, I can get anything, riches beyond your imagining, our world will worship you !"
We are going home.
"You will be nothing on Earth, cast out and despised, feared and reviled for your gifts !"
"What of the slaves, Arkon ?"
The slaves ?
What are they to our happiness ?
"Everything, Arkon."
I am offering you a world !
Don't be a fool !
The slaves are nothing.
No living being has the right to enslave another.
Step by step.
There's still lots of work.
I don't understand why our artistic director is walking like a peacock after everything they wrote in the paper.
What did they write?
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
She can stand in for me anytime.
What article?
It's been a month since I read the paper.
3 pages in in the newspaper about our nice little theater.
What did it say?
They're doing an investigative report about financial irregularities.
We have to get rid of our artistic director.
It's not that simple.
"Submit your candidacy, they'll back you."
You submit your candidacy.
"Do me a favor, get serious."
"- Do me a favor, let me direct."
I don't need that.
"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"
Sergio Leone died yesterday.
Is that so?
What a shame.
He was young.
"Who is it, Liyova?"
A friend of yours?
"No, Mama, he's a great director."
"An incredible director, eh, Yitzhak?"
A Fistful of Rings.
- A Fistful of Dollars.
"Dollars, yes."
1966.
"Well done, Papa."
Yes.
My name is Laine Hanson.
My address is...
"Youcanjustdothat , pull phone records?"
Iwork for a pretty powerful guy.
"Yeah,we'reclose, we were close for a while."
"That's till recently, of course."
Our career paths sort of went in different directions.
At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.
"At this point, we just need... to look at every aspect of her life and find everyone that knew her."
You never know what you're gonna find.
- Did you find anything?
"- No, no, not really."
Not really?
You mean...
"A little bit, actually."
"I did speak to other classmates, and they told me she was pretty wild."
Wild?
"Yeah, she was wild."
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids are gonna have a field day.
Have you spoken to them?
"Um, me?"
No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.
- But not you.
"- Uh-uh, no."
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
"- No, I haven't."
"So no one like, maybe, the National Enquirer... or one of those silly television programs..."
"- that show, um..."
how much you charge?
-Fifty thousands.
Fifty and fifty do one hundred...
"Good, we go the three."
"Boys, it seems the Day of the Deceaseds, comes, animaos."
-Always with your jokes!
-It is possible that you never change?
"We go, Ciotti is going to begin the visits."
Let's hurry!
.
"-No, no, this way."
-In agreement.
"Boys, the women are as they are, we do not have to create problems to us, we must amuse to us."
"I excuses, Professor, you have seen the young lady Italia?"
Why?
Because I must put the injection to me.
You have that to put the injection?
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"Ah, the gentleman must put the injection?"
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"I have understood if you well, the gentleman must put the injection."
"Yes, that."
"You come with us, we will put."
"One does not worry, you will not feel any pain."
"We already are, happens."
"-That is, does not worry."
-Bend down.
"Now you stand here, Lean here... a little more side... that is."
Comfortable position.
We open the buttock.
-The ass.
-The muscle Relaxes.
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki...  because we wanted to know a lot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
Portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
Czechoslovakia.
Italy.
Poland.
Bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
Brazil.
Cuba.
Holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water. "" All died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
People are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
Just a minute.
What's your name?
"McKendrick, Sir."
The British Army appreciates your generosity in donating gratuitous lessons in hand-to-hand combat.
"As it happens, the army's already prepared a manual based on some actual experience in real fighting."
In future you will cooperate with your instructors and refrain from exhibitions of circus gymnastics.
Is that clear?
"Perfectly, sir."
Who's that new geezer over there?
"Don't ask me, I've never seen him before."
He don't seem to like our Canada.
Fall out.
"Carry on, Sergeant."
"Very good, Sir."
If you can.
Next man.
"How long is it now, Flash?"
I was born up here.
That sergeant must be Dracula's big brother.
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
You ain't even queasy.
"How come, Canada?"
I'm a rollercoaster man.
"They've completed, Sir."
"Thank you, that was most instructive."
"Thank you, Sir."
If a little bothered.
"Excuse me, Sir?"
Yeah.
As you've only just arrived and I've er...
You're saying?
"Well, somebody who'd been here some time might be useful to you, Sir."
How is she?
My God...
Cumbersome.
Madam?
I'm a jewel broker.
"Since the announcement of my next wedding,"
"I keep getting visits from jewelers, decorators..."
"While browsing, I found in a jewel store,"
"I will not tell you his name by the way, these beads."
"These beads are beautiful, Madam, but again: it's not."
I m sure the Princess Danidoff would be very happy to have them.
Where are they from?
"Show them to her first, then you'll decide."
I will give you a great price.
And I have other jewelry.
A moment.
"Oh, look, I'm in a hurry!"
"If you decide to buy, meet me tomorrow at the Orsay railway station."
-Alright.
"Jean, please get Madam to the door."
"- Well, sir."
- Good evening.
"This is extraordinary, but..."
"I swear, my dear Norbert, these are the jewels that were stolen from me."
I have every reason to believe you.
It is this woman?
A receiver of stolen goods who sells the goods that thiefs put in her hands.
I'll buy them.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
Pay yourself.
Good morning.
I think you heard the news.
"I provide the supplies, you provide the service."
"If we're gonna be partners, we need to share the risk."
Same deal I had with Des.
So you need to know how to do this.
I know how to do it.
Properly.
Like a doctor.
How about if I inject you?
Whole purpose is for me to show you.
You can talk me through it.
"First, you have to find a good vein."
Press up and down gently.
Mm-hmm.
This will expand the vein and make it easier to see.
Just like people.
You apply enough pressure and they show what they really are.
Now take the syringe.
Insert the needle.
Pull back slightly to show a bit of blood.
That's good.
You want a slow and steady release.
"Too fast, you'll send the body into shock."
"You always remember your first time, right?"
We should celebrate... our partnership.
Want a drink?
Can I use your bathroom?
"Yeah, just down the hall."
Let me get this straight.
Your dealer is behind this whole thing.
That's right.
Grady Burgess.
Because you owe him money.
He was found two weeks ago.
Patrolman saw him wandering on Bahnhofstrasse.
"Dazed, confused."
"Ran his prints and uh, found that he worked for your group, NATO Intelligence."
Thought you could help us.
He was stationed in Zurich.
Shuffling papers.
Hm.
What'd the doctor's say?
No.
He's catatonic.
"Appears to be awake but he's uh, not responsive."
There's been no change in the two weeks.
I think he's hopeless.
So whatever he once knew will die with him.
Nothing?
"No sir, we had a tracer put on Keene's passport."
The woman as well.
But they vanished.
And Jared Clayton.
"They are moving him into a nursing home, outside of Staad."
On NIA pension of course.
Of course.
"All right, we tie up the usual loose ends."
Release statements about terrorist cells to cover up.
"And tomorrow morning, we'll be back to business as usual."
"Good night, agent Henry."
"Sir, there's just one more thing."
It's very late.
It's about the Kozlenko affair.
What about it?
"I did some research, and as you know the NIA keeps excellent records."
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"So we throw some in a college fund, but the rest is fair game, right?"
"After taxes, after we pay Doug and after my management fee."
"Okay, fine, manager."
- Can you loan me a few grand?
- What for?
Clothes.
I had my cancer purge.
"But now I am in the public eye, and I have nothing to wear."
You want to take Isabelle's hard-earned dollars and blow them on glad rags for your star turn on Agrestic Access TV?
You bought a motorcycle and a ridiculous leather jacket.
All right.
Let me think about it.
No.
- Are you okay?
You look a little frazzled.
- I'm fine.
- Who kicks ass?
- I'm guessing you.
I totally kick ass!
"- What does ""kicking ass"" entail?"
"- A girlfriend, but that's not all."
Did a free cheese grater come with the girlfriend?
"Oh, stop it."
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.
"- Sweetie, that's fantastic."
"- Way to go, little man!"
The whole lower school voted.
I'm gonna go start working on my speech.
"- Congratulations, honey."
- Thanks.
"- Oh, are we worried?"
What I saw was the night-show;
He's into the matinees now!
Let's apply some ointment...
Why did you go there anyway?
I went for a soft-drink and she didn't let me open the fridge.
The thief?
She must have had it herself.
She's stolen so much already.
Is that the truth?
Of course.
All right.
Papa will set it right!
"Aunt will set it right, you mean!"
Well...
Aunt will!
"Back to the table, Bharti."
"I've got an order for 50000 pairs of shoes from Italy, sir."
The manager has left his file.
Good.
But he said we can't execute the order.
Why not?
Slaying animals is tough... thanks to the animal protection groups.
They're protesting atrocities against animals in the Capital.
"You'll get a shock, Bharti."
Kaushalya... you switch it on.
"""Listen to the secret news from Bharti"""
"""There are many thefts taking place at No. 10, Juhu Scheme"""
"""Our reporter, Aunty, is investigating the robberies"""
"""We present a special report"""
You even steal!
That's not me!
"They're playing such dirty tricks on film stars, too!"
.. will go bore as your bolts will become loose.
To know your father's counter schemes after Vasundhara Devi caught him red handed..
.. we replaced Ram G with our Master.
They are planning to kill you.
"- Master, do as I say."
"Master, this is body bullet's remote."
You should handle this.
Okay
Our Master gave you the gun which had dummy bullets.
We showed you a dummy death via cinema technique.
I am a fighter.
There will be no interval until I finish the mission I take up.
Just climax.
"If it missed there, it won't miss here."
Karthi..
Come on!
Jump!
Come on!
Keep going!
Karthi..
Karthi.. Tell me Mr. Ratnam!
"Sorry sir, the entire family has died in the accident."
What?
They collected the bodies on the highway and sent it by cargo sir.
They will handover if you come and sign sir.
I am coming immediately Mr. Ratnam.
"Hey Macha, you had seen a business man in me till now."
Now you will see the actor in me.
Very agonizing thing has happened sir.
Sir..
Vasu..
Business man in you has got the Padmasri.
I have a family that needs me!
"When's the last time you did something, anything, without thinking about how your family might react?"
- I think Griff is in trouble.
"- I told you, he's using!"
Tell me you think our brother is not on drugs.
- Natasha!
"- I tried calling, silly, for a month."
"It wasn't that whole night with the coke thing, was it?"
- You and me had a good thing.
- I was used!
Now I need you!
"Allen, I fired him."
He's done.
Let's talk.
"Jesus, she's a cop."
What the hell happened?
Fell through the floor at an abandoned factory chasing some jackass.
- How's her airway?
"- Looks clear, but her sats are low, 93 percent."
I'm taking her up to 10 litres of O2...
let's push ***.
She's tachypneic but breaths are shallow.
Where are those chest tubes?
- Laryngoscope?
"- Kelly clamp, now."
Got no radial femoral pulse by palpation.
- It's already at the carotid.
- That's not a good sign.
- How is she?
- Right tube... is placed.
- You need to find her husband.
"- I'll call dispatch, let them know."
Oh!
Looks like he's been dead a lot longer.
Area's swarmed by something.
Exactly what I was thinking.
"On areas not consumed by insects, I found blisters, hives and swelling."
Anaphylactic shock?
From insect bites?
Anything could have triggered the allergic reaction.
"My cousin, if she even looks at a peanut?"
Blowfish.
"Well, these are insect bites, and that gets Lexia off the hook."
"Still, I mean that is one hell of a bee sting."
We need to go to the Underground and find out what Gene Hansen was doing before he died.
Oh?
Underground?
I have to go change.
I can't go looking all corporate like this.
Corporate.
- Hello.
- Hey.
I got a case that's taking a tour through weirdsville.
- You care to join?
- I'm a little tied up at the moment.
I got a dead...
line to meet.
"Oh, all right, you don't have to explain yourself to me."
- I've got a life.
- I thought you were dead.
I'm busy.
- You're wearing that?
- You're wearing that?
"Okay, this is strictly a fact-finding mission,"
Here you have.
It is it to me before.
How I have left?
I do not understand how you can lower like this.
"Ten, for fortify."
Is it possible to be known who is that girl by whom arms as much trouble?
"Good morning, Mr. Santarelli."
You are friends of him?
"No, we are of the S.L.R. Service Cleaning New born."
"Yes, those that leave bad we threw, them."
What has happen to him?
Notices some sharp pain?
Where?
Here?
In the kidneys?
Where it is?
I pillaged it.
The temperature is normal.
What feels?
"Go, Go."
"Well, Doctor, we go away."
"Yes, we have an appointment in tanatorio."
One has gone to him?
"It was not a real pain, it is an emotional reaction."
It seemed to him that he was bad and he began to complain.
But now it is under my cares.
"A series of analysis will be necessary, so that it is better so that it is better to drain the intestine completely, we are going to begin by a medicinal injection."
-It does damage to me.
-Shut up.
Lady?
there is something for me?
Delay mail?
Can't go watching soap operas all day.
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't.
Listen to the doctor.
"Margie, this is Reznik."
The man who cost me my arm.
"How do you do, Mrs. Miller?"
"I've been better, Mr. Reznik."
Is there some place we can talk?
Check it out.
It's a beauty.
8 cylinders.
MagnoSphere.
Speed sensitive steering.
ABS breaking with road texture and tension.
Defence lock-up helps you maintain control in emergencies.
"Of course, it's an automatic."
Hell I wanted a stick... but I figured my shifting abilities wouldn't be so hot.
"You know I am not at National any more, right?"
"Yeah, I heard about it."
"It sounds like you almost lost one yourself, huh?"
"Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?"
Ironic?
"I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade."
"I'll break it down for you, Miller."
"Moments after you left the shop, someone powered up my machine."
With my arm in it.
I nearly got killed.
Accidents happen.
It wasn't an accident.
Accidents happen out of negligence.
This happened out of spite.
No snowballs reported in hell.
No sightings of flying pigs.
-What am I gonna do?
-You don't know?
"Come on, Alan, you were married for 1 2 years."
What does marriage have to do with sex?
Point taken.
"Okay, you want some tips?"
"No, no, nothing like that."
I need step-by-step instructions.
All right.
Since this is your first bout in this weight class...
... I'dsaystickwiththebasics.
Better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly.
Got it.
And the simple stuff would be... .
"Well, you know how women like you to go slow?"
Really?
My ex-wife put a premium on brevity.
"Her motto was, ""Less is more, and none is perfect. """
"Well, Sherri's not like that."
You're gonna wanna take your time.
-l can do that.
-But don't loiter either.
You don't want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head.
No loitering.
Got it.
-Something else?
-Okay.
"When you're with a woman like Sherri, who's so gosh-darn beautiful..."
... thatyougetexcited just thinking about her...
... howdoyoukeepthesprinklersfrom going off while you're still mowing?
It gives us hope that perhaps there may be others
Does she remember what happened in the coach?
No
And have you seen the other children?
Did they talk to you?
Why you?
Now that Camille is here perhaps Audrey's turn will come
"Like Pierre says, Camille's return gives us all hope"
Easy for you to say
There must be a reason why she's the one who came back
Why her?
Camille!
I'll go
Don't treat her like a monster
"Please, she needs our help."
It's not her fault
Go away!
I never should have listened to you
People fear what they don't understand imagine how they feel
What about them?
Did they ever wonder how I feel?
They are just like Léna and Frédéric
They look at me like I'm a monster
You can be so selfish
What?
Have you ever wondered how your sister might feel?
You came back.
Do you realise how lucky you are?
"You're a miracle, Camille"
And what do you do with it?
Nothing
It looks like I'm wasting my time
- Yes.
- I am Tonjura.
I am pleased to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.
- We would like to extend our deepest regret.
We cannot help you in this matter.
We are not a violent species.
And not equipped for war.
"I'm sorry, Robert."
- The Arktorians have always been here.
"Silently monitoring human progress, along with several other races."
But now they're all returning home.
-You mean evacuating?
So now we really are alone.
-Yes.
Thousands of years of accumulated human data ends here.
- You could have gone back with them.
Why didn't you?
Or at least given them the Purian.
- They've fulfilled their duties to the council.
This is not one of them.
"And as I stated before, I'm not leaving."
-Is this John?
John Walker?
"- Yes, yes, this is John Walker."
- It's Denise from the motel.
You told me to call if anyone came inquiring.
"Well, there are government agents inside this room as we speak."
"Well, you didn't tell them anything, did you?"
- No.
I didn't.
But these guys have real badges.

For the...
For the first time some women in... the family has dared to run away like this.
Such a big step is impossible without the help of the household.
The cards have been printed.
What face can we show to our relatives?
I'm not a cheater.
Neither is Natalie.
That's all I have to say.
"Well, I'm afraid we can prove otherwise, Captain Stottlemeyer."
"After the drawing, we received a phone call."
An anonymous tip.
I asked Mr. Lawrence to check it out.
I reviewed the tape from Monday night's show.
"I didn't see anything suspicious, so we examined the machine itself."
We examined the balls.
"We measured them, we weighed them."
We were bouncing them.
And everything seemed perfectly normal.
"So, what's the problem?"
This is the problem.
The same numbers?
The same numbers.
But that's not possible.
That's what we thought.
So we tried again.
And again.
And again.
And the same six numbers kept popping up.
"Not always in the same order, but the very same numbers."
How did that happen?
They're very lucky numbers?
Metallic paint.
"Very good, Mr. Monk."
We took a closer look.
The numbers on these six balls and only these six balls were painted with metal-based paint.
All the others were acrylic based.
There's a magnet in the microphone.
What did you see?
Who is that?
Independent Auxiliary Unit 13...
"I heard you were a descendant of ""Koga ninjas,"""
but your talents exceed my expectations.
Looks like I need to examine this further.
What is this?
What have you been doing here?
It's exactly what you see.
Remember it as you embark on your journey to death.
How did you get there?
You did this?
You punk!
Cross Tornado!
It's all over.
"Ambition, love, relationships..."
These are the reasons why we stake our lives for battle.
The battle with the giant deity brings back memories of pain.
"From the day I lost my big brother, my battle had begun."
"Don't miss: ""The Great Soldier"" on Great Dangaioh."
That's not right Kuya...
Why aren't you being more like your usual goofy self?
"C'mon, I know you can do it!"
Um... what do you mean by that?
"So, how are you feeling?"
I feel much better now.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
You've been asleep for a week.
"But as your doctor, let me say something..."
"You're only human, you know."
Remember that.
Right...
A drink!
"Whoever gets Nightsweet Premium, drinks it"
I brought you here to ferment wine not to drink it!
Understand!
?
Drinking a bit gives you power!
Nonsense!
Don't make excuses!
Bull!
You just won't believe it!
I don't care-next time I catch you drinking I'll have Dad chase you off!
"Master's ""eagle claw"" kung-fu is powerful"
Take a good lesson for us
Spoken well!
"Please teach us a stance or two, Master!"
Attack me all together!
"Excuse me, Master!"
Want to run?
Speak-why do you want to assassinate me?
You left us no other way out!
"So, we just try it"
Die!
It's not up to you
Turn them over to Lord Chao tomorrow I'll kill whoever resists!
Really?
It's a secret that I learned about
Chang Seventh of th winery knows it too?
Those two guys who smashed us last time...
They must been sent by Chang Seventh!
We've surely created a deep enmity!
I talked to a winery worker...
They said Chang Seventh loves to drink... and then practice Drunken Immortals fighting
"look down in pity--"""
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
Shut up!
She'll never forgive you!
Shut up!
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.

There's no sense in fighting what's necessary.

Penalty for Ms. Hitomi...
Fifteen years ago...
Thought I'd find you here...
Don't you have work to do?
This is a part of my job.
What do you mean?
"It's fine to affirm one's position... but left to your own devices, you're the type to brood, you know."
It's true that she may have been the one who changed your destiny...

"You can't help worrying, suffering."
But you have many people depending on you now.
Don't forget that.
Yes...
I guess so.
"I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll definitely kill him!"
"I kill him, I'll kill him..."
What are they doing in there?
--Say...!
--What!
You numbskull!
What happened in there?
I won't tell!
"But, what if something terrible is happening...?"
It's remarkable.
Tremendous.
"Look, at long last."
The Temple of Ages!
This statue's extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't think it's a statue.
You're right.
I believe we have discovered
Solon himself.
"He must have been caught in a volcanic eruption, and covered in hot ash."
Like the bodies at Pompeii.
He's hanging on to something here.
It's the platinum book.
"Yes, like the page we found inside the Ark."
"Yes, well I think I'd better hold onto that."
Might just help defray some of my traveling expenses.
Look!
The gods march in rank.
"The riddle says when the planets are aligned, we'll find the Treasure of Atlantis."
Where is it?
The red crystal.
The one in the observatory?
We forgot the second line of the riddle.
"""Hecate races in the heavens."""
The planets alone isn't enough to reveal the treasure.
It takes something more.
Hecate has to appear.
Who the devil's Hecate?
A demon of the night who rides a chariot of fire.
There she is.
A meteor shower.
You've dieted until you've disappeared.
Now I'm starting to wonder if you can be too rich.
There has to be a potion in here somewhere.
You need an Other Realm camera.
Everyone knows those cameras add a hundred pounds.
(doorbell rings)
That's Harvey!
"Order me a camera, now!"
"Come on, Sabrina."
We're not going to be able to vote for ourselves if we're late.
Self-opening door?
Cool.
"Not very safe, but cool."
(running footfalls)
Has the camera arrived yet?
Yes!
Finally.
Hurry up and take my picture.
Could we take another one?
I think your eyes were closed.
"Sabrina, I'm down here when you're ready!"
And sorry to anyone I woke up.
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.
"Okay, everything's going to be fine."
Uh-oh.
You think that happened because we didn't use name-brand film?
"Oh, look, it says the camera only brings you back for a few minutes."
"So much for ""Take a picture, it'll last longer."""
And you'll start to flicker whenever you're about to disappear.
Like that.
"Quick, take another picture."
Babar Quereshi just published a mathematical formula for perpetual calendar calculations.
"I know you think he's perfect, but not yet."
You must let me have this one.
He needs to be pushed just a little more.

"What's the feeling, Otto?"
They were all outliers.
Their gifts set them apart from the world.
Like you're set apart?
There was no one to protect them.
What would happen to me if you went away?
Same exact heroin compound found in all five victims.
None had a history of street drug use.
This is a homicide investigation now.
US or local PD?
[Chuckles] Five victims over three states.
"I think we take this one, don't you?"
"Yes ma'am, I think we do."
Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.
Said his death wasn't an O.D.
If I'd have stopped it then...
"No, the Bureau didn't."
So I'm telling you to stop it now.
Use whatever you need.
No more bodies like this.
"Yes, ma'am."
Agent Pritchard.
How'd you make the connection?
Kept digging.
Then just got lucky.
"Apparently he's only been missing for a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
It looks like Zaddik might have been telling the truth
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
Maybe we could help you.
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time.
That thing is hunting in daylight now.
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
You see?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
All right.
"Well, in the meantime,"
There's another wraith out there.
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
All right.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other wraith.
It is all right.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
For a long time now I have blamed myself for your unhappiness and suffering.
And when I think of the music I might have written if not for the guilt which has murdered my vitality all these years!
"But Chopin has seen a happier side of you, it seems."
You can't think that I...
that he and I were lovers?
I'm not sure it was a good idea of yours dedicating the Etudes to her.
Why not?
We are in love.
We can afford to be generous.
They're running away together!
It's a catastrophe!
- It sounds like fun to me.
"- Oh, I see."
Ever the wily peasant you are.
"With Chopin out of Paris, your music no longer suffers the comparison!"
They say Majorca is the most magical island in the world.
The sun will bake that silly cough out of your lungs in no time.
Think of it!
Spain!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Don't you understand?
She'll kill him!
She'll kill him!
CHOPIN:
"May we shut this, please?"
"No, darling, the air is good for you."

ENHOH
Although I'm gonna miss this place.
- I'm not.
This place stunk.
It's bush-league.
- Why'd you go here?
"My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else."
"Yeah, that 2.0 grade-point average didn't reason into things."
- Shut up.
- Between the lines.
Go die.
"Sure you don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together?"
- Thanks for the mirror.
- My pleasure.
"Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shaky's afterwards for pizza."
You want to come?
"I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun."
You won't believe this.
There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there... setting up professional film equipment like she's shooting a movie.
- You're kidding.
- Whose mother is it?
I don't know.
Little precious must be around here somewhere.
- I hate people with money.
"- So do I, with every fiber of my being."
"Me, too."
Money people.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Are we leaving soon?
- I have no idea.
Should you have an idea?
"There was an accident, closed the interstate."
"Then why, Luis, are you alive and Julio's dead ?"
"I'm cagey, man."
Not cagey.
Meaningless.
Got the bullet from Julio ?
Right here.
22-caliber.
Long rifle used for distance.
And not a match to Luis's gun.
"What else, Alexx ?"
"Julio's got ulcerations of the oral mucosa, stomach and intestines."
That's rare for a young man.
Yeah.
And look at this :
He's got burns and lesions on both hands.
"Now the burns could've come from drug use, but the lesions, I don't think so."
"Alexx, I want to order a CBC."
A complete blood count ?
I don't think this is drug-related.
You think he was killed for some other reason ?
Not killed.
Assassinated.
"Horatio, I've got the results of the blood work you asked for."
Ran Julio's CBC with a complete white cell differential.
And look at this :
his lymphocytes are alarmingly low.
"And you couple that with the ulceration, and, well..."
He's been exposed to radiation.
And not a little.
We're talking serious exposure.
This guy was working in this stuff.
"Thank you, Alexx."
"In fact, my involvement with you and mr."
"Stark could,"
"On the face of it, be considered treasonous."
"I don't need to know the details of your past, mr."
Jarvis.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Our investigators found an open manhole cover
They assume the thief came up there.
Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment?
Seems unlikely.
You said it rained the night of the break-in.
It was a positive deluge.
Why?
New york is one of the last cities
To still use its sewers to run off storm water.
The tide gate opens and the water runs into the river.
All mr.
Brannis would have needed is a raft and a forecast.
He could have floated his stolen treasure all the way to the sea.
I'm heading out.
Make sure the chief gets this when he gets back.
You got a hit on my passports?
Prince charming's name is sasha demidov.
You might know the rest of the story.
He was dead before he died...
battle of...
Wherever?
Finow.
"Congrats, sousa."
You are the brains of the night shift.
You ladies have a good night.
We must sink them!
Only Commander Yu Jong can issue such orders.
It will be too late if we wait for Yu Jong's orders!
"If they get away, you will be killed as well!"
Admiral Yi does not have the right of command.
He is not to take independent action.
That is the order of the King!
"Practice restraint, Admiral."
"Admiral, they have passed the big island!"
"If we don't act now, it will be too late!"
Very well.
I'll will go!
And I will assume full responsibility!
No one is to take hostile action!
What?
"Admiral, give me your command!"
Are you going to let it end like this?
Do not take action.
Your life and your men's lives are at stake.
"Admiral, we're running out of time!"
"If they pass Hando Island, they will be out of our reach."
It is high treason!
Admiral!
Go after them!
What happened?
They launched the ships.
Yi Soon-shin has taken action!
How dare he!
After them!
Don't let them get away!
Full speed ahead!
Don't let them get away!
Hey.
- Hey.
"- Any luck with the sponsor, hunt?"
Nobody's made a donation since Sonny Newman was alive.
"Check this out, bro."
They're back in town.
Been here a while I guess.
They came into the copy shop to design this for some kind of business that they run.
But get this.
"Back in 2002, they won the lottery."
Brought back the Chiefs for one season and then became these big time poker players.
- So are you thinking...
- They lived here.
They played hockey.
They got lots of cash.
"So when the Chiefs folded, we took our lottery money and we went gambling."
"Roulette, dice, poker, Vegas, Atlantic City."
We were high rollers.
"But it was an empty life, you know."
"Babes, booze, bar fights."
"Our wives left us, took our kids."
You guys have kids?
"- Yeah, we got three of them."
"- Yeah, one each."
"Yeah, the judge said we weren't good role models."
Said we have to find peace and balance.
"That night during wrestling, I saw a TV ad for Peace and Balance."
- So we bought a franchise.
- Zenovation.
- So how's business?
- Sucks.
- Real bad.
There's a field drag effect too.
We're having to use a lot of power to maintain our speed and heading.
"Avon, I saw Mandrian with this."
Then he put it back in the bottom of Sara's flight bag.
What is it?
That's what I want you to tell me.
[ALARM]
Look!
Filtration malfunction.
We'd better get down there.
- Dr Kendall wants you.
- Filter plant?
There's been another killing.
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
Tell me what happened.
"I was coming past, and I heard a noise."
So I looked inside.
Mandrian was just as you see him.
"Sonheim was standing over him, with this dagger in his hand."
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him!
Power reserves are almost gone
"In 103 minutes, it will no longer be possible to operate force wall and main drive simultaneously."
Please decide which to close down.
Without main drive we'll never get out of this.
Without the force wall we'll be smashed to pieces!
Have the locators detected the outer edge of the storm yet?
No.Yes!
No.
Maybe.
"Which is it, Vila?"
And why do we care if he's a deserter?
We've already talked about this.
- Hi guys.
"- Welcome, bro."
Don't call me bro.
We are now considered to be on the same team.
I'll go and think over this 5 strangers on the team business.
Enjoy your work!
What work?
"- Good morning, Uncle Metin."
- Good morning.
Can I borrow your lighter?
Perfect timing.
"Hey, we won't bring the subject up right away."
Okay?
We aren't going to mention anything about cheating or stealing.
I know the guy.
He'll start acting like a brother and will start lecturing us.
"First, we're going to go through the method of giving him a hard time."
Great.
We'll give him such a hard time that he will understand what...
- we have been through.
- Wait a minute.
Where are we going?
The road that leads to success.
Really?
"So, is this the road to success?"
We're the only ones walking this road.
Doesn't anyone know about it?
Exactly.
"See, these are your rivals."
Go and get your application form right away.
Don't rush.
Do I want to know what you had to promise him
To get him to come?
"No, it wasn't me."
"It's not like he even listens to me,"
And he probably just ran out of girls to have sex with.
"I, uh, want to apologize."
My absence has been inexcusable.
"Well, I know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you."
You've had to deal with so much loss.
But I'm not gonna lose you.
"I'm here for you,"
Every step of the way.
"You, uh, you look good, Lily."
"In fact, you look better than good."
You look great.
Thank you.
I feel great.
So you had better be prepared
"For a lifetime of family brunches,"
Because I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey.
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood
For watching a pretentious movie I don't understand
With you and Vanessa.
"No Vanessa, but pretentious movie?"
check.
"Look, not that I'm not thrilled to expose you"
"To the joys of Russian cinema, but does this visit of yours"
You folks need any help?
We're fine.
Just a little trouble with a tire.
"For your own safety, you shouldn't be on the shoulder any longer than necessary."
"We're leaving now, officer Thank you."
We're clear.
It started.
Briefing's started.
We're not going out today.
We don't have to go to briefing.
"I know, but nervous is nervous, and when he doesn't see me..."
- ... he starts to think I'm in trouble.
- That's just his overactive imagination.
I have a feeling he's gonna see you soon enough.
So the records of gasoline consumption and mileage have not been accurate.
Therefore the logs are gonna have to be adjusted.
The following officers will report to the clerk immediately following briefing.
Patterson.
Wilson.
Sylvia.
"Johnson, T.J."
Poncherello!
Get away from the door.
I said get away.
Excuse me.
"Sorry, sarge, I couldn't hear you."
"We couldn't hear him, right?"
"- No, actually, we're looking at these..."
- Baker.
That's aiding and abetting.
I don't want to see that face.
"Come on, we're not even on duty."
[Collective chatter]
[Sirens wailing]
Magnum .44.
I bet it was from the same gun the exterminator used.
Who the fuck are you?
"Agent Shaw, from the c.I.A."
So far you haven't been very cooperative.
And just why is the c.I.A. Interested in this case?
"We're interested because in these sensitive times, two months before elections, the exterminator has been stirring up a lot of resentment against incumbent politicians and the entire judicial system."
"This could easily be the work of the opposition party, or maybe even a foreign government."
"Dr., uh, Megan Stewart, please."
What do you think?
I think you have to take a shit.
It's coming out of your mouth instead of your asshole.
[Phone ringing]
Hello...
Dr. Stewart.
Hi.
"- Hi, there."
"- Hey, listen."
What time do you get off work tonight?
I'm on call all night.
Damn it.
There is another solution.
"The nurses call it, ""midnight admission."""
Midnight admission.
"It's, uh... it's an empty, private room."
Shame to let it go to waste.
Okay.
See you soon.
[Pa announcement] Coronary emergency.
"Dr. jenester, to emergency."
I haven't taken advantage of my employee benefits yet.
I'm entitled to 50 Euros worth of goods per month.
That includes former employees as well.
I looked into it.
Now's the perfect moment to start in with that.
They owe me 44 Euros and 10 cents now.
That costs 5 Euros and 90 cents?
That stuff is expensive.
Are these friends of yours?
Can't you see this has been blocked off!
?
"But it says, 'shopping free of charge' outside."
They haven't torn down the sign yet.
Please exit the building!
Why?
We want to go shopping!
This is the scene of a criminal investigation.
"It just doesn't work like that, if it's written on the sign..."
"Get out immediately, otherwise you'll be shot out by the task force."
Toni's dream
Can you help me with my tie?
What?
"My tie, I forgot how it works."
No.
Why don't you just ask Franz?
"Okay, okay."
It was just a question.
I just can't do it.
That's fine.
Would you come with me?
No.
Would you please leave me alone now?
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
david:
Get off!
Get the fuck off me!
(REWlNDlNG)
(GUNSHOTS)
DAVID:
I don't know how they got in.
"I mean, how can they have gotten the door code?"
It changes every shift.
Unless someone...
They knew the code and I told Mere... I told Meredith to lock herself inside the broadcast room to broadcast over the emergency channel.
-(pounding)
-Fuck.
"If anyone's even listening, if it's even still on the air..."
They've cut into all our other secure lines of communication.
I don't know how.
"I mean, who could know that much?"
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
Wait.
What did he just say?
(REWlNDlNG)
"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
katherine:
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.
Yes.
"I swear to God, if you were pretending to talk to someone..."
"Katherine, I gave him the code."
He verified the code.
"Yeah, but did you verify him?"
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic and low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape to the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
"That is true, Victor."
He has acrophobia among other things.
Find a different test for him.
Acrophobia is not a problem with my device.
Start climbing.
"I will do anything else you say, but I am not going up that building, understand?"
- I...
- Sickle I command you to climb up that fire escape.
"You will go to the very top,"
"You will turn around, and you will look down."
And you will not be frightened of heights.
Off you go.
It's working.
It's working!
It seems to be.
"- Oh, just until I make one."
- What time is your appointment?
Why?
My teeth are straight.
To justify charging me more money that I don't have.
Robert Dumanjik from the District Attorney's office.
The District...
"Oh, yeah, okay, put him through."
- [telephone rings]
- Hello?
"Hi, Karen, This is Bob Dumanjik, We haven't met, I'm the,"
"- No, I know who you are."
"- Oh, good, good,"
"I understand that you're representing that suit against Atlantor,"
"Yes,"
"I wondered if we could talk about it,"
Talk about what exactly?
"Well, that's what we'd talk about,"
But I don't think that I understand.
"Well, we'd talk about that too, How about tomorrow?"
What is this about?
Should I be expecting a subpoena?
"Oh, no, no, I just think there are some things that are in our mutual interest to talk about,"
Let's say 10:00?
- Downtown?
"- If that's okay,"
- Okay.
"- Great, See you then,"
What was that about?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Does this much slate exist?
They'll have to dig up Rhode lsland to find this much.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
"If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes."
See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
"Let me take care of him, will you?"
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
"Speak up, MacChesney."
Speak up!
"We were swindled, sir."
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
"You surely didn't do that, MacChesney, without proof?"
"Sir, we had our suspicions."
Suspicions of what?
Come on.
I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
"From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir."
"No, I did it."
"I bought the map myself, sir."
"Now, listen."
"Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter."
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it.
It's the first symptom of flett-giordano.
Would you just excuse me for just one moment?
Where's Elka?
She said this thing had no symptoms... and I'm out there... limping around like Dr. house.
Elka said she looked it up on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia?
Wikipedia says that I'm 37.
And I should know.
"I'm the one who ""corrected"" it."
"Okay, calm down."
I'll look it up online.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry.
Uh...
"So in, in terms of publicity,"
"I was thinking-- miss Chase, when exactly were you diagnosed?"
"Uh, last week."
Why?
The most acute symptoms... occur within the first week of onset.
"By now, you should be having trouble with... facial drooping, involuntary body spasms, word slurring, hysteria."
"Boy, this thing is awful."
"Yes, it is."
That's why we applaud your courage in going public... with such a disfiguring disease.
Disfiguring?
Who said anything about disfiguring?
Well.
There's that hysteria.
"Miss Chase,"
"I understand why you're wearing this scarf, but may we just take a look?"
"Oh, um, listen."
Could you just excuse me for just one more second?
Wow.
"It's, uh, not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?"
"Uh, do you like it?"
It-It is rather a fine one.
"- Oh, my."
"- S-Sorry, Grim."
"Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks."
"Ah, very amusing."
"Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?"
"Oh, you're gonna love it' Chef's been fixing his speciality: stuffed crab."

Eh?
What about the Egyptian press?
What about the rest of the world?
They are colonialists.
I don't care if they have an agreement.
"These things are for Egypt, not for the amusement of a British aristocrat."
"Yes, monsieur, I understand."
Very well.
As you wish.
They say we must wait.
Go back to the tomb and watch them.
"If they break the terms of the concession in any way whatsoever, call me immediately."
The slightest infringement and we shall take control of the tomb.
You understand?
HOWARD:
We've counted over 600 objects in this room alone.
Everything has to be wrapped and protected.
"So far, we've used over half a mile of cotton wadding and 16 bales of calico, and we're only halfway through."
"- Good morning, gentlemen."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Howard."
- This is Harry Burton.
"If you need any photographs, speak to him."
I won't allow any other photographers in here.
"Oh, my God."
It's extraordinary.
"Carter, look at this."
"Oh, my God!"
"Evelyn, come and see this."
"Oh, that's beautiful."
Aren't they lovely?
HOWARD:
This must be his wife.
"It's me, José."
- They've asked for reinforcements.
- Smithy.
"- OK, I'll deal with it."
- Show me what we have to do next.
Can you see those iron girders down there?
The inspection tunnel is on the same level.
That's the most vulnerable part of the dam.
The water pressure will destroy the rest.
- It takes a long time to build one of those.
- I don't care.
Do you care that many innocent people are going to die down there?
Why did he say that?
He'd do anything to reach his goal too.
- He's like a leopard.
"- Yes, intrepid and merciless."
I wouldn't like to be his enemy.
"Hey, Jaime!"
"The explosive has to be attached to the end of the girders, understood?"
Make sure nobody surprises us.
I'll stay here.
Everybody take cover!
"Hurry, Jaime!"
There's at least ten of them.
They're in control of the dam.
Wake up!
I can't shoot without hitting our own men.
Some of you must go to the other side!
- The convoy mustn't go onto the dam.
- Too late.
"Hey, look!"
Over there!
"""With strawberry lips you glued me tight"""
(theme music)
(man panting)
- (man screaming)
"- What a way to die,"
- mauled to death...
- Henry... you don't know that's what happened.
"You didn't see it, George."
Those terrible scratches on his face alone would let you know if you did.
Sir.
"What have you, George?"
"Sir, the man who discovered him was checking his snares this morning."
"He seemed surprised, almost disappointed to find out he'd snagged a human."
I suppose he was expecting his dinner.
Right.
Have him come down to the Station House for a word.
Do we know the victim's identity yet?
"He has nothing on his person, sir."
"We searched the area for his wallet, no luck."
"Judging by the scratches on his face,"
I'd say he was attacked by an animal of some kind.
"- Higgins has a theory, sir."
"- Uh, George..."
Does it pertain to this case?
"He certainly thinks it does, he hasn't shut up about it."
(Higgins sighs.)
Henry?
"Sir, it's like a..."
I only saw it for a minute.
Saw what?
"You better follow me, sir."
Push it!
No brandy!
But-- but the pain!
Maybe you'd better let your little brazilian butcher boy do it.
"You remove it, my boy."
I can't work runder these circumstances.
Forgive me.
"Well, community?"
Tonight we stuff ourselves and drink captain taylor's brandy!
Here.
Thank you.
Save your strength.
You're going to need it.
Captain taylor!
My name's crusoe.
Where'd you come from?
"I'm a castaway on this island, but I'm here to help you."
- Are you alone?
- No.
There's more than one of you?
Just.
You're an optimist.
"If I help you regain command of your ship,"
I need your word that you'll take my companion and myself off this island with you when you set sail.
"You have it, sir."
"Jacob moore, the leader of the mutineers, is as desperate a black heart as ever lived."
"A few of the men follow him through allegiance, the rest obey him simply through fear."
I'm working on a plan.
"Until I come back, you stay here."
I will return.
"Good, sir."
Is this an old cannibal trick?
"- Oh, return address."
Exactly why did you take this?
Habit.
Just habit.
"You stuck your hand in the wrong cookie jar, little girl."
The price of being with my husband will be insanity and death.
I hope it was worth it.
Bad Fae.
Stupid girl.
Someone should have told you never to cross a Fury.
Get out of my head.
This is nothing.
I'm gonna sear your mind beyond repair.
Let's turn up the heat.
- Let's go.
- My bag.
"Call the grease monkeys, man."
I can smell brain oil burning down the hall.
"Tong says break some cases, I'll break some cases."
Yeah.
You know the surefire way to convince a therapist that you need help?
No?
Show up to your first appointment late.
Therapy is bullshit.
Human bullshit.
"If you don't play ball, you're gonna end up one castrated cop which means you're useless to our side."
Go to your session.
How's the head?
Achy.
I don't really remember what happened.
Can you just put that down?
"- And where did you get that, anyway?"
He's telling you I'm not real.
He is lying to you.
You're lying to me.
That's Leo speaking.
That's not even Dr. Bryar.
"Why don't you let him think for himself, Leo?"
You...
Can you see him?
"- Yeah, he's right there."
- Shoot this kid.
Why don't you let him make his own decisions?
Shoot him!
The voices.
"They helped you, right?"
It's where you get your ideas from.
"While the other kids were outside in the playground, you were inside reading, studying, learning."
The voices wouldn't stop.
They helped you understand things that other people could never realize and...
"Then as you grew older, it became almost a responsibility."
Right?
A responsibility to use that ability.
To use your knowledge.
String theory.
The Theory of Everything.
"Shoot him, Ted."
"Then M-Theory, encompassing all the strings, unifying the theories."
"- Don't push him, Reid."
- You know what's funny?
Most people say that M-Theory can never be proved because the mathematical tools do not yet exist.
- Don't push him.
"- But you see it, right?"
Am I right?
"Learn how to drive, lady!"
I will get to the meeting when I get there.
I looked death in the face today.
Hel... hello.
"Yes, I would like to leave a message."
My husband ordered an eggshell dryer...
"Not talc, not parchment..."
Eggshell.
"Hey, you're home early."
What happened to you?
Doesn't matter.
"So, I called that appliance store, and I demanded that you get the dryer that you wanted."
"Oh, well, it must've worked because they're taking away the wrong one right now."
"Anything for you, princess."
Ooh!
Who's this guy?
"Get over here, sexy."
"If you want to see sexy, I just..."
- Ooh.
- Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
"Oh, d... what is all over you?"
"- Well, now you are."
- Ah-choo!
What do most of us want from life?
How about someone to love?
Somewhere to live?
Somewhere to work?
And something to hope for.
"Love, home, work, hope - ambitious maybe, but those four expectations define a good life and have done for generations."
"Now there is an election coming, and Panorama has been finding out if politics and politicians can really deliver what Britain wants."
"Oh, about that we're not supposed to be brothers?"
"No, don't flatter yourself."
I don't break that easy.
"Oh, good, 'cause I was just being honest."
"Oh, yeah."
"No, I got that loud and clear."
"[ Telephones ringing, police radio chatter ]"
"Thanks for your patience, agents."
Coroner's report finally came in.
"All right, thank you."
"All right, let's see."
Did Wayne McNut really weigh 300 pounds just moments before time of death?
316 to be exact.
And the official cause of death?
Cardiac arrest.
"But between you and me, that's just a guess."
The vic suffered massive organ damage.
"Here you go, Jenny."
"Ruptured spleen, pierced liver, collapsed lung."
Looked like everything was just [slurps]
Sucked right out of him.
Like he'd been hoovered?
Yeah.
"Yeah, you know, I got to be honest, fellas -- hm?"
We're stumped.
This type of thing just doesn't happen in Stillwater.
"Now, did Wayne have any enemies?"
Hmm.
More like an unfriendly rivalry.
"A guy named ""Slim Jim"" Morgan."
"Like Wayne, he was pretty well-known in the competitive-eatin' circuit."
Competitive-eating circuit?
"- Of course, I knew her well."
Killed in the rearguard action at Gedden.
"I knew she was reported dead, sir."
I never heard any details.
There was a great deal of confusion when the High Council were restored to power.
Most of the old guard were killed in the fighting.
They remained loyal to Servalan right till the end.
"And a lot were executed later, weren't they?"
- All the leaders were purged.
- The penalty for choosing the wrong side.
I myself was under arrest for a short time.
"Well, I suppose it's better to die bravely in the field than to face execution later."
PA SYSTEM:
"Attention, citizens."
Attention.
This is a census call.
Assemble in the concourse now.
Use entrances 1 and 3 only.
"I repeat, entrances 1 and 3 only."
Let's try over there.
- Ah.
Any ideas?
- We'll have to go through him.
"That's what they're expecting, friends."
Follow me.
If you want to stay alive.
We'll lie low till the check is over.
- DAYNA:
What's the check for?
- Catching people like us.
The unadapted.
- Unadapted?
"So far, so good."
I have been directed to address you... on the possibility of making the army your career.
- [Muffled Whimper] - [Laughing] - [Laughing]
[Laughing Continues]
"[Charles, Laughing] Army..."
Career...
I'm sorry.
"If I held that in, my teeth would've exploded."
- You gotta be kidding.
"- Gentlemen, please, it's impolite to laugh at the senile."
- What'd he say?
- Loss of hearing is the first sign.
Will you clowns keep quiet!
Some of us are interested in what Col. Potter has to say.
"Go on, Colonel."
"- Why, thank you, Major."
- [Kissing Noise]
"You blow one more kiss, Pierce, and those lips will never walk again."
Please.
I'd like to hear this too.
- [Making Kissing Noises]
- Oh!
Blow it out your bugle!
"- Colonel, please continue."
"- Gracias, Padre."
"Now, I think you'll admit... the army presents unique opportunities... that can't be had anywhere else."
That's very true.
What other job lets you die for a living?
Certainly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
The army provides a chance to see the world.
Scenic tours of all the great battlefields.
- It provides a home.
"- Where you going, dog?"
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
- I'm gonna kill those bitches!
You already did!
Repeat hemogram and update tetanus.
Keep your hand there and don't take it off until you get upstairs.
"- Dr. Corday, when you have a chance?"
- Be right there.
Make sure the blood bank sends type-specific straight to the OR.
Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
- Are you the one...?
- A neurosurgeon will perform it.
He'll talk with you shortly.
- I'm sorry?
- Don't let me die.
"You' re one cold-hearted bitch, you know that?"
"I don't have any damn pity for you, whore!"
"I'm talking to you, pissface!"
"Don't you dare turn your back on me, you stuck-up little ass-shaker!"
Where the hell do you think you' re going?
!
Pardon me.
Coming through.
"Watch your back, sweetie."
Excuse me.
"- Doc, I'm gonna miss the season-"
- Keep your cup on.
I should have been off two hours ago.
You still here?
Can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
Them's the rules.
"Don't worry, they don't know who you are."
I didn't come here to catch you.
"Till now, your strength and my weakness were the same."
I didn't know who you were till date.
"But now, both our levels are equal."
Arresting you  killing you is not a big deal.
I won't do that.
Do you know why?
You are my special case.
"You are my partner, aren't you?"
I won't leave you so easily.
I will catch you red handed with evidence.
I will know your every move.
Forget about robbing.
"The moment you think of robbing, I will cut your nerves and pluck your heart out."
Rs. 500 crores.
Election fund.
Party office.
12 noon.
Tomorrow.
You challenged that you will catch me red hand.
Catch...you can never catch me.
This is the real kick.
Kalyan or Kalyankrishna...?
Check everyone thoroughly before sending them in.
Be it MLAs or Ministers.
Why so much security?
There is a terror threat to the party office.
I know.
I told you that.
Count fast.
- High command has entrusted me to distribute the election funds.
And if it backfires... what do I risk?
Don't ask what you risk... but if you'll be true to yourself.
"The prints of ""Weekend in Sochaux"" are booked all summer."
It's possible in September.
"For unions, it's free of charge."
Fine.
I'll send you the form.
For us the problem was how to incorporate their demans into a larger revolutionary context.
We were stuck.
So we gave the camera to the workers.
What they shot was pretty surprising.
Stronger that what we did.
Their perspective is truer.
They go straight to the heart of the problem.
I think we've gathered enough material.
They want to edit it themselves.
I'm not at all sure about this.
They need a minimum of technical skills.
We have to help.
Monique can go do the technical stuff.
Great.
That settles it.
I went shopping.
Tonight I work at the restaurant.
With the lesbians?
Not lesbians.
Feminists.
Did you pick up the print?
The phone was ringing all day.
But I need it for tomorrow.
So get it yourself.
I didn't mean that.
What we share isn't only blood ties.
What binds us together is emotion
"Of love, of togetherness, and our upbringing"
I will destroy your dreams of magnanimity.
I'll show you... what money's might means.
You slapped Shekhar Malhotra's ego
I will put to auction in the marketplace your temple
Advertise the auction
I will destroy Saraswati Audio.
I'll make a pauper out of Om Batra
Slash prices.
I don't care.
"We have money, he has nothing"
"I've done it, Om"
This is Jai Batra.
He has designed the fastest car
"Sure, I'm ready for the engine tests"
"Shekhar, Jai here."
I'm returning to India
To pay back what Om owes you.
Sure Jai.
Welcome back To India
"But don't come to return my money, come and save your house"
I'm auctioning your house
He was hiding this all along
He thinks his brother is worthless?
He wants to fight it himself?
Why were you hiding this from me?
Om!
You were a father to me!
You were my father
Why did you tear yourself from me?
Master
"Gao Jian, I took pity on you as a young orphan"
That's why I kept you here to learn martial arts
"But you're not behaving well, causing trouble"
And have no respect for your elders!
"If you don't want to stay here, you can go!"
"Master, it's not my fault 2nd and 3rd Brother have ill treated me"
"And in turn, falsely accused me as the villain!"
"Master, don't listen to him!"
He hurt us on purpose
Brother's wound can get serious if we wait longer
"Master, it hurts so much!"
Shut up!
Dad
Let me check
That's not your business!
What's the first rule of our school?
T roublemaker and treacherous fighters
Will be punished severely!
A crab and claws eight

Hooray as it came!

"A four, a five and a six"
Drink till you're sick!
I'll drink.
I've never hesitated for a drink
Roasted chicken wing
My all time favorite!
And roasted pigeon?
It's just amazing!
I'm late.
My husband and child are expecting me.
I'm sorry.
Nobody is expecting me.
"- Goodbye, Pavlos."
"- Goodbye, Aliki."
That was 'I love you!

"He squeezed every nickel out of this platoon, remember?"
"No, no, no, I tell you, no."
"I can't spare another truck, and that's final."
How am I going to get my platoon back to the barracks from the rifle range?
Never mind.

The enemy is you.
How much weight are you gonna lose?
"Um, like 30 pounds."
- Are you starving?
- I could eat.
You're a masochist.
"Yeah, and you're..."
- You're the other one.
Grab the steering wheel!
And go!
What do they want?
Stop.
This is the expected behaviour if they wave at us.
It must just be some sort of greeting.
They seem to be evolving in this respect as well.
It seems as if a simple movement of the hand replaced handshakes.
This is how they signal that they aren't carrying weapons.
And what do you know about this?
It must be some sort of routine check.
Prepare your IDs.
There's no point looking in the bag.
It's full of the items related to the fire.

"Not a doctor, but a land surveyor."

Yeah.
The producer just called.
I...
I got the job.
When were you planning on telling me about this?
"This morning,"
"And then you put internships on the ""do not discuss"" list,"
And I panicked.
Why?
Why?
This is not about competing for something.
This is-this is about our relationship.
"But both of those have been so tied up in each other,"
"And this job is a huge deal for me, Dan."
But you can't pretend like you going away for three months
Is not gonna affect us.
I think I didn't wanna face that.
It was just so much easier when we were just friends
And we could talk about things.
"All right, is-is that what you want, then?"
You wanna go back to just friends?
I don't know.

"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
At ease.
"Now, men, Mr. Jeffries has something important to say to you."
"Boys, I've been managing picture theaters for a long time."
This is the neatest and best-drilled company of ushers I've ever seen.
But some are not measuring up to the necessary standards of discipline that I insist upon.
I won't mention any names.
This is merely a friendly warning that any usher caught chewing gum during the performance of duty will be dismissed.
I also have a report that a certain usher is making a habit of using the men's lavatory on the mezzanine floor for dice and crap games.
This must stop.
I think I've made myself clear.
Carrasco's back.
- How many people died?
- Have something to drink.
Thank you.
"Welcome, Carrasco."
Enrique!
"They don't know, do they?"
"In Puerto and Timulcha, they called us criminals."
People here should know about that as well.
Padre Julio has kept the truth from them.
"They dropped leaflets from planes, but he said that it was nothing but bad propaganda, that Carrasco was supposed to surrender, that the Leopard was beaten."
Leave them alone for a while.
These men need to rest.
Go back to your work.
I'll go and get him immediately.
"- General, the president is on line 1."
- All right.
Thank you.
- This is General Benítez.
- We need to airlift fuel to the north.
- That's impossible.
- Why?
"During the blockade of Berlin, thousands of planes were employed."
"Of course, Señor Presidente, but we don't have any planes."
Don't argue with me.
Carry out my orders as soon as you can.
- Very well.
I'll do everything possible.
- You better had.
"Excuse me, these are the new defence plans for the refineries."
Thank you.
...plan 3 is to be carried out immediately.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Not me.
You.
Island Hoppers is going to sponsor you in the Iron Man.
"Oh, no."
No way.
A person's gotta be crazy to enter that event.
Mm-hmm.
That makes you the perfect candidate.
"Besides, look at the difference in our bodies."
"I mean, I'm all shiny, muscle and power."
But you...
you got the legs to win it.
That's right!
And I intend to keep them.
"I mean, think about this, T.C."
"Swimming, running a marathon and then bicycling a hundred miles."
All right.
"What-What-What about all this """" I owe you one, T.C.""?"
When does that get paid?
"Well, that's different."
"I mean, that's entirely different."
Vouchers.
What about vouchers?
"Vouchers for... for gas, vouchers for air time, vouchers for this, vouchers for that."
When are you gonna take care of that?
"I'd do it, T.C. I really would, but, see, I'm on a case with Barbara here."
Ah.
"Now, I've had occasion during the past 24 hours to scrutinize the body in question."
- Mediocre reflexes...
- Mediocre?
Average motor skills...
Sure...
But this is not the most important thing in life.
What is most important in life?
To live in harmony with yourself and feel free.
We seem to have problems with that.
You're wrong.
This is the first place I have felt truly free.
"You're joking, aren't you?"
No.
You only value what you lose forever.
We have lost the illusion of freedom.
But we were never free in reality.
We had some troubles and communal inconveniences.
Freedom is the ability not to depend on circumstances.
It is the ability to think.
It is victory over your fears.
Do you ever feel fear?
Sometimes.
Freedom has nothing to do with bars and locks.
Somebody gave an order to do away with me.
Who did it?
My business partner?
He has been dreaming of getting rid of me for a long time.
Sell the control package of shares.
The Americans are offering great money for it.
Sell your shares to me.
I'll buy them.
May be it was Marmazin?
He is an oil-trader.
He is an authority.
"- Hey, bro!"
- He feeds the cops from his hand.
What the fuck is all this?
"So he invited Cho over, killed him, put the body in a sack, dragged it to his house, and then killed his wife?"
Crime of passion.
Make sure you photograph everything.
"Here, there, that stuff over there."
Jong-gu!
Get over here!
"Sergeant, come over here."
Shit!
Oh god...
That cocksucker.
What kind of twisted freak is he?
"Is that scary, or what?"
"Scary, my ass."
"Anyway, the whole town's talking about it."
Who told you that story?
Byeong-gyu.
That goddamned bastard...
"Now he's spreading those stories to you, too?"
"Well, from what I hear, there's definitely something off with that guy."
Like what?
"The corner store owner went crazy,"
"The guy at the mill dropped dead, and then Heung-gu turns up dead two days ago."
So?
All this happened after that Japanese man arrived.
"Quit talking out of your ass, you ignorant dope."
Who're you calling ignorant?
"Look, the test results on Heung-guk came back today."
"Apparently, he ate some fucked-up mushrooms."
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
It won't happen again.
- Thank you.
- Did I fail?
- No.
- I-I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell them...
- Most patients come to Rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh... day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more..."

"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, Miss Porter."
Shall we?
- Of course.
"- And if you decide you don't like it,"
I'll come right back.
- Okay.
- Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"- Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
- I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
- Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"- Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"- Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.

Is she anyone of note?

"God paired us off, did He?"
That's a colourful dress

I wanted to wear a suit.

Have you ever fallen in love at first sight?
I have just chosen my mate for life!
And his name is Om
"What are you doing, Shanti?"
He promotes new singers
So I think I'll sing for him
"I tell you, I love you"
What have I landed myself in?
So horribly out of tune
Now I'd like to hear Om saying that to me in front of everyone
"If I must, I must"
How do you feel?
I feel like a scapegoat
I welcome students from all over the country... who are participating in this finale of...
Best of Best Generation Next
Two teams have made it to the finals
The girls' team from Bangalore.
And the boys from our college
That the charge of treason was dropped almost immediately?
It's a start.
"Before the war, I served under a general."
We traveled a great deal.
We were in budapest when I met anna.
She worked in a hotel tailor shop...
Sold me the most beautiful tie.
"And then the war broke out, and things became..."
Difficult.
She was jewish.
"Still is, I'm happy to say."
"The general carried several letters of transit in his safe,"
"Any one of which would have ensured her safety,"
But he refused to sign.
You forged his name.
Hence the dishonorable discharge.
It was filing the papers that sunk me.
I was arrested in the middle of whitehall.
Hmm.
On a Tuesday.
How did anna get out?
The same way I avoided the noose.
Howard?
"Mr. Stark had unfinished business with the general,"
And he and I had always got along.
"When he heard of my predicament, he..."
Used his influence.
Sounds like a story.
"Another time, perhaps."
"Anna obviously knows what howard did for you,"
But she doesn't know what you do for him?
"Not recently, no."
"""A proclamation to modify the quantitative limitations applicable to the imports of wheat gluten."""

- This is what I mean.
"She's not less worthy, but neither is she more than the other ninety thousand public school teachers who are retiring."
Who weren't lucky enough to have a staffer as a former student.
- That's trouble.
- Who would find out?
"""Who would find out"" is also where we frequently find trouble."
- You're right.
- Yes.
"All right, you're right."
- Hey.
- You get it done?
- Yeah.
- He's taking his name off it?
Yeah.
"Well, it feels like we're almost done in there."
You wanna tell me what this meeting's about now?
Replacing Hoynes.
- What are you...?
- Bruno wanted us to look at replacing.
- Josh.
- So we're looking at it.
"We're looking at it, and everybody's treating me like... ."
- Why?
- There's electoral math.
- Was I sent away?
- No.
- So I wouldn't be at that meeting?
- No.
To me.
If only it had found me first.
If only I could have stepped in front of him.

"The mayor has the highest regard for you, judge."
And I for him.
Your resignation in about six months would be appropriate.
"Six months, did you say?"
How about six hours?
This is the scene at the D.A. 's office  where city officials have been brought in for questioning in the story surrounding the resignation of Judge Walter Stern.

"Lean and hungry, even the fat ones."
Any news?
Got anything?
"Thirty seconds, ladies and gentlemen."
Love is getting kindled...
Sight is going beyond the eyes.
"(Are you) The flower of inner sun, or my penance?"
Is this love or enemity?
"Hey, love has become my eyes..."
And is withholding your beauty.
Your fragrance has become my way
And brings me closer to you.
A storm is galloping like a horse...
And my heart has climbed aboard and vanished.
Even robbery becomes just...
When my wish steals you away.
Where is your father?
Has he absconded?
He isn't picking my calls.
He can't run away from us.
If he doesn't meet us tomorrow
Things may turn ugly.
"- Who's that, Deepa?"
Someone I know.
"Any problem, Deepa?"
No.
Nothing.
"Are you the woman past desires, The one ruling all my desires?"
Are you the one to rope the moon in your forehead?
"You became the enchanted forest in one single flower, my lady"
Are you the one to pour nectar on that day?
The thought of you approaches me and burns my soul.
I lost my loneliness.
I lost myself in your thoughts.
You are my companion.
I like Varun a lot.
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Manoj.
Based on what you said...
After cheating me as Deepa...
She didn't take much time to meet you as Ashwini.
She has met you even when I was still at the hospital.
"So, she might've chosen Manoj as the next target after you much earlier."
Yes.
So we must find out the way she finds these blind people.
Yes.
Apart from Manoj and I being blind...
What is common between us?
A blind man is cooking...
That made people to come to my restaurant.
That gave me publicity.
That helped my business as well.
Yes.
I have even written about him.
Manoj...
Has there been any newspaper article or TV news about you?
I'm not all that famous.
I'm just a simple man.
She will not come after a simple man.
- Exactly!
You are successful in your field.
You must have gotten some recognition.
You must have been received some awards.
Or any ceremonies that you have presided over as a chief guest...
Something like of that sort?
You could have spared the biscuit.
Looks like Vijay Awards memento.
"I'll fix engagement next week as you wish,"
I'll make other arrangements.
"Sister...congratulations, your engagement is fixed next week."
- He ignored me.
- Who?
Who else?
That kick guy!
Bloody idiot!
Is Kalyan here?
When?
Where?
Why are you so excited?
Why did he ignore me?
I am sure he's here to ruin my life.
"It's him, right?"
It's not him...it's not him...
it's him...
I'm sure it's him.
We believe that you'll catch that thief.
You need any help sir?
I need a journalist.
I'm here for my partner.
I'll definitely find him.
"Your interview was rocking, your still in the paper is very glamourous."
You've a good photogenic face.
Have you settled in Malaysia?
How's your accommodation?
"Very good, but weather is hot like you."
"I thought you'd come to marry here, have you come here cracking my clue to catch me?"
"I feel like shaking hands with you, will you give me a chance?"
"Don't rush off buddy,"
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
Because the stone is too small
If use bigger stones you may not require lens
Only ladies have come?
What about the male members?
He is a merchant at Rangoon
He will come once in three years only
"Bye, visit frequently"
"Quick, If you delay like this you will be late for school"
-Look there
- How did he come here?
Why are you standing here?
This is my house We are the new tenants
-ls that so?
"-OK, you may go"
"Careful, leg, gently"
Bye
"Mom,you have gone there without giving me breakfast"
That girl insisted that I must attend the house warming
"Poor girl, she is one legged, bye!"
One legged?
What is he saying?
"-She had both the legs, right?"
-Yes
What do you think about yourself?
Will you give us the amount demanded by us or not?
Do you know who we are?
"If you donate funds for us you are saved, otherwise..."
Let us see how you run this factory
You are talking over phone as we are screaming from here?
Creating mischief?
will tear you apart
"Boss, did you call me?"
- On her husband
- last night at the cocktail party.
- Before he was killed ?
Yes.
I don't want to get her in trouble.
Do you have the application on you ?
"Term policy, a million upon death."
Jennie Hale.
She signed it.
Any idea where she is now ?
"No, I'd like a small service."
"Uh, nothing too pricy."
"No, no."
Cremation.
That's what my husband would have wanted.
So Jennie's got a million reasons to kill her husband.
Should we bring her in ?
I want forensic proof.
She'll wiggle out of it too easily.
Everyone bought one of those policies.
We may have forensic proof.
"There was trace on the murder weapon,"
- Bahamian aragonite.
- Sand ?
"Produced by coral reefs in the Bahamas, high pH, large granule size, unique to the region."
- So our killer was in the Bahamas.
- Not necessarily.
Remember that yearbook we looked at ?
"Oh, yeah. ""Senior class trip to the Bahamas was awesome."""
"I got a way to find out where that champagne bottle came from, but we're going to have to go back in time."
"Hey, Krystal, wait up a minute."
"Oh, officer."
You also burglarized the secret service.
I'll spend a little time in prison.
You're not getting what is important here.
I'm not getting what's important.
And the fact that I changed my name--
"Which, by the way, I did so the soviets wouldn't find me,"
Not to hide from our government.
Important.
That--Mrs.
Frederic fixed all this.
She expunged all the charges.
Someone obviously unfixed it.
"- Artie, focus."
"- Oh, I'm focused."
Here's the key.
Who gave Dickinson my file?
"Find out, that'll take you directly to who has the sword."
And that will lead you to Macpherson.
Who?
Time's up.
"Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time."
Put in for transfers while this whole warehouse business
Is still just a sidetrack in your careers.
Scars don't have to be permanent.
- Yeah.
No can do.
- Just think about it.
"Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do too."
"Now, I may not be your boss anymore,"
"But until someone tells me otherwise,"
I still outrank you.
So this time I am putting you on a plane
!
Don't flatter yourself.
I couldn't care less about a spoiled kid like you.
You're simply a diversion to lure away the palace's eyes.
What?
!
Let me fill you in on a little secret.
We're going to kill the empress.
What did you say?
!
You're going to kill Her Majesty?
!
Do you seriously think you can do anything that absurd?
!
Is killing the empress really that absurd?
We're going to destroy those detestable Outer Terrans and become the rulers of this planet.
I won't let anyone stop us from attaining our rightful place.
"No, not even you, Ion!"
All eyes at the palace are on you at the moment.
"I thank you, tovaras."
Damn you...
Are you that concerned for Esther?
Looks like I guessed right.
"But are you sure it's wise, Ion?"
"She's not only a Terran, but a member of the Vatican."
So what if she is?
!
"My point is, do you really want to be betrayed yet again?"
How do you think I predict every single move you make?
Are you saying Esther is betraying me?
!
What rubbish!
How can I help you?
Okay.
Meet me at the station.
Desmond Bennett wants to make a statement.
Probably wants to make a deal.
Can't wait to wipe that smug British grin off his face.
Cool.
I'll wait for forensics.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, and then I'll go arrest our girl."
All right.
My patients...
"Morgan Lewis, Ethan Grant, Troy Dixon."
What's this?
That's a video statement.
Each patient has one.
Is physical evidence really a good idea?
We decided we needed an insurance policy.
"In case we ever got caught, we have a legal contract and statement that proves the patient gave consent."
You think this is gonna hold up in court?
I hope I never have to find out.
How do we find our patients?
They come to us.
"Well, we're gonna have to do something about that, maybe hire some death dealers."
I'm not soliciting death.
You should be.
What else?
Now we practice injections.
Hold your arm out.
You're a funny girl.
"Relax, it's saline."
"I think you misunderstand the nature of our relationship here, Mary."
"- Will you, I am leaving"
- Hold it
- Kanmani
"- Mom is calling me, I will go"
I was holding the cycle for you to learn
-Who will teach me then?
-Am I not here?
-You?
-Yes I am
- Do you know how to ride a cycle?
- Are you asking me?
I will give you a list of things I can ride
"Bike, Car, Lorry, Bus, Train, Aeroplane, Helicopter..."
- Do you know to ride a cycle?
- Why are you so doubtful?
"Trusting you, if I ride and suppose if you.."
..push me on someone and run away?
"I won't go to jail after pushing you over someone, listen to me"
- You ride and show me first
"- Move away, see now"
From that day to this day The sky has not changed
Man has changed Has mounted on the cycle...
Go singing like this
Oh God!
- Oh God!
- Dirty pig
Were you trying to cheat me?
Festival at coniamman temple Give donation
You don't look like people from temple
To prove that should we have a bell in hand?
- Give us the money
- Why do you drop 50 Rs?
I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus III.
Probably.
Rank hath its privileges.
"How well we both know that, huh?"
Scotty.
- Kirk here.
"- Travers, Jim."
We're waiting.
"Good, commodore."
We're on our way.
Be sure to bring along your tactical people.
I've got an interesting problem for them.
"We'll beam down immediately, commodore."
Kirk out.
"Captain, I wonder why he's so insistent that our tactical aides come down."
"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of nowhere."
He probably wants additional advice.
"Perhaps, captain, but nevertheless, I..."
"Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality?"
"I, for one, could use a good nonreconstituted meal."
"Doctor, you are a sensualist."
You bet your pointed ears I am.
"Ready whenever you are, captain."
Energize.
- Kirk to Enterprise.
Red alert.
"- What is it, captain?"
Cestus III has been destroyed.
"Space, the final frontier."
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission:
"To explore strange, new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
Good.
Nigar Kalfa will be with her
She'd never leave her alone
I'm relieved.
I won't have to worry about her
I wonder whose idea it was to send her there
Our Valide Sultana agreed to it
Nigar Kalfa will be more beneficial there than she was here
I came here for...
His Majesty gave me this lucky charm when I got pregnant to Mehmet
What an elegant amulet
Yeah
I always carried it at the birth of my children
It supported me
I want to gift it to Hatice Sultana
Is that how you ask for forgiveness?
Good idea
That is a very valuable gift
Our Sultana will be happy
Let's visit her some time
Will you accompany me?
Of course
We'll visit her first thing tomorrow
Wow wow
Such great things
If you want we can place one infront of your house
No my Paşa.
I'm not a Paşa.
I'm a poor man
They'd make fun of me
"My Paşa, they'll annoy you too"
Because the ones who saw these at port were already gossiping
"But this is thievery of the educated, done for easy money"
"Mrs Batra, I might report him to the police."
But I haven't the heart
But he will never gain admission into any university.
That's his punishment
He will never find employment in any computer company
His future...
I'm very sorry.
But Why did he steal?
Whatever the reason might've been only Jagadish can tell
You have betrayed my faith in you!
"Not you, all of us bear the punishment"
How much money did you make out of selling papers?
Even you think I'd do such a thing?
I was just helping a friend
"At least you'd understand that, I learnt it only from you"
Learnt from me?
What?
Thieving?
What am I?
A thief?
Helping friends!
Is this how you help friends?
By robbing?
"You haven't a degree, you have no future."
You're ruined
You are a thief!
I am a thief's brother.
And that's the truth
You will achieve nothing in life
"Jai was my weakness, you were my strength"
"But today, you make me weak."
Come on go
Have you started the classes?
Is she learning our language?
We are studying my Paşa.
But she's not that keen
You'll learn our language quickly
How much did you pay for me?
We have got lots of golds.
I'll give you as much as you want
Just let me go
I understand your anger.
But think twice before talking
Because
You are neither talking to a merchant nor a pirate
Were you ever captured?
I'm grieving
I'm miserable
I don't know what to do or what to think
Nobody treats me bad here
But I treat everyone badly
Anything I want is done.
"Dish, drinks"
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm a prisoner
I request you to release me
I realised it is not happening.
But at least let me walk in the yard
"I want to breathe, walk and ride a horse"
Don't tell me you couldn't manage it
Did you find it?
I told you I would bring it
Did anyone see you?
I took it when everyone was in the yard
What do you mean?
You have to pay the remaining six thousand dollars before you can have your license
Six thousand more?
Of course
"Give me back the money, I'm not buying it"
"Well, then all that will cover the administrative costs lf everyone came in like you and messed about, how can we run a business here?"
Country bum
How come you puke just after a short car ride?
Are you alright?
Luckily I haven't bought it
"Otherwise, you can't enjoy it"
Come down
"Hey, you..."
Damn
What happened?
What are you doing?
Stand still
You want your money back?
Here I'm sure to have my money back
And along with some administrative fee
Thank you
Hey
Don't you know me?
I am Choi Ha ls it really you?
Yes I couldn't have recognized you if you hadn't call me
Let me look at you
Well?
You are pretty
Just put on more make-up to make yourself pretty
Money is for spending l heard that you've got married
Are you going to be a mother soon?
Really?
This is all very dramatic but what makes you so sure
- you'll find The Beast tonight?
- Stay tuned.
"Jo, on me."
You know what's great about science?
Eventually it can achieve pretty much anything.
Just put in the hours in the lab and you... can make all sorts of cool things happen.
This is bait.
A scent engineered at a cellular level to attract the predatory olfactory system.
"Which is smart speak for ""it rocks""."
And this is your basic Sunday roast.
Before all the cooking and the gravy.
Add the scent.
"It'll spread and if there's a supernatural carnivore out there, it's going to come running."
I'm switching to night vision.
OK.
Let's fall back to the truck first.
Steve!
Do you smell that?
- So...
- No.
Sorry?
"You were either going to ask me if you could help, or try to find out something personal about me."
Either way the answer's no.
- It's cold out.
- I'm pretty warm actually.
Wasn't talking about the weather.
I see movement.
Ten o'clock.
What are you doing?
!
It's a tranquilliser gun.
-Shh!
- I can't hear anything.
-Quiet.
Logopolis has stopped.
And I was vain enough to think it was me he was after.
Logopolis is his target.
Turn that machine off.
You have no idea what you're doing.
"Merely emitting a sound-cancelling wave, Monitor."
Logopolis is now temporarily suspended.
The silence gives us an opportunity to discuss its future.
There will be no future.
"You are eroding structure, generating entropy."
An absurd assertion.
I know the power of this device down to the last decibel.
But you do not know Logopolis!
"But I shall, shan't I?"
When you tell me of the secret work you're doing here.
I cannot tell you.
Why have you created a copy of the Pharos Project?
"Hmm, the time has come for you to share your secret with me."
No!
No one must know.
That has been our firm decision.
"Very well, we'll wait until you change it."
Patience is a particular virtue of mine.
Father.
That's not your father.
"Tremas is dead, murdered by him, the Master."
Nyssa.
You killed my father?
But his body remains useful.
One goes another comes
All of you burn in hell
What is iy my Bey?
What happened?
Who's this girl?
I don't know.
I don't know her
Brave woman though
Let me take you to the council of poets
"If there's the Aşık(lover) Çelebi, he'd say your future to your face"
Maybe there's another woman in your destiny
Fortunately you are here
I'm always lonely here all day long
Our Paşa is very busy
He can't dedicate much time to you
I have no complaints
It is enough that he is here with me
I wish our baby borned immediately
It is almost over my Sultana
"You'll take have it on your laps soon, inşallah"
Amen
Welcome my Paşa
You too
"Nigar, put this on my table"
I need a ware of this cruel person that he always uses
With your permission I'll go wash my face
It is too hot
Have a seat.
Tell us what you did today
Bring me a cold drink
I'm about to faint
What's that in your hand?
"I hope, Frankie was right."
You think anyone won't notice?
Wait.
I want to get a picture of my heroes.
All my heroes.
"Come on, Dad."
Just because Cody answered one rescue call doesn't mean he's part of the team.
"- Yes, it does."
- Or we're not.
Cody is our liasion on this mission.
He's the reason we're even giving this place a chance.
Are we clear?
"Dad, did that thing just talk back to me?"
Something's definitely wrong with the robots.
We can't use technology prone to malfunction.
They're not malfunctioning.
They're aliens.
- What?
- What?
Script by Arvegtor Timing by Deska
Galactic showdown!
"In a fierce battle for survival, the Republic and separatist armies have clashed in the distant Sullust system."
"Count Dooku's most cunning assassin, Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack."
"Trident group one, attack the starboard engines."
"Trident group two, knock out their port shield generators."
I'll go directly for their bridge.
The port side deflectors are gone.
Lord Tyranus.
My master.
There is a disturbance in the force.
"Your assassin, she has become very powerful."
When did that happen?
In the womb would be my guess.
Any chance we may bump into your old coworkers?
"Or even Wendy, perhaps?"
Wendy and I decided to leave it alone for now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Turns out Ol' Blue Eyes was wrong.
Love isn't always lovelier the second time around.
"In fact, it's kind of painful and strange."
- Yabba.
"- Enough chit-chat, Ziva."
A man's got to work.
- McGee.
- Wallet was found near the body.
No cash.
Victim is Caleb Adams.
"23, petty officer second class on the DD-350 Hagen."
It's a destroyer docked for liberty at Chesapeake Bay.
Check for surveillance in the area.
Those two with him?
They said they found him this way.
I'm still getting the details.
Doc?
Abrasions on his hands and face indicate the possibility of a fight which was ended by this single stab wound.
Ugly.
"That's it, Tony?"
Only one word?
No wisecracks about wayward sailors on shore leave?
No obscure On the Town references?
Is that a movie?
I understand that sailors often refer to this liberty as their annual beer-and-crabs week.
"Yeah, basically there's a really fit bloke"
"""His reputation precedes him."
"""He's been in and out of the scandal sheets."""
"""His attention to style has been noted."""
Something of a dandy.
"In the Regency House, the ladies are all aflutter."
Musician and dandy Mr. Austin Howard has arrived.
"Well, well."
"Famed for their wit, dandies were invited to house parties to charm and amuse the ladies."
How wonderful a greeting.
"Regency pinups, they were feted like pop stars."
Such gaiety.
Everyone's very excited about your arrival.
"Without money or status, there were few opportunities for black people to enter society."
Musical talent offered a rare way in.
There's a definite lack of musical talent in the house.
Is there indeed?
Do you play the piano?
"Uh, no, but I'm going to have..."
My quartet will be arriving shortly.
"Well, I'd like to introduce you to everybody."
"So, what did you think of Mr. Austin Howard, then?"
Um...
Marks out of ten?
An 11.
Really?
G.B.'s only an eight.
"I was going to say 12, actually."
Twelve?
There you go.
"Miss Victoria, 12."
Twelve?
Must be bypassing the filters.
I must find the filter system.
"That'll cut off the flow, it was coming through the ventilators."
Filters.
See what you can do for those two.
Avon.
Have you found anything?
Take a look.
"He's the fourth one I've found, all of them unconscious."
It's Sonovapour.
Yes.
I know.
We found a couple.
It must be coming from the filters.
"Yes, well that should be this way."
It's over here.
Here it is.
Not a very expert job.
Just stuck the tubing into the primary feed.
"It's effective, though."
Look at the gauge.
The cylinder is almost empty.
"Once it was empty, the filter system would have cycled the gas out of the atmosphere."
At which point everybody would just wake up.
On the face of it a seemingly pointless exercise.
So wake them up and ask them what it's all about.
"Increase the oxygen supply, it will speed recovery."
He's dead.
Very.
Someone was very thorough.
All this damage has jammed the main controls on a circular flight pattern.
Can it be repaired?
-Arul don't go
-Leave me
-Listen
"Whatever happens, none of you should come out, go"
- Let us not
"- Go in, do what I say"
-I will..
"-Brother, you just sit here"
How dare you touch the MLA?
Have you beaten my dad?
How dare you touch my dad?
How unfairly they have beaten you up?
B-1 Police Station Ukkadam
MLA Gajapathy came to beat me I have hit him back
So I surrender
The MLA is already dead
- Who hit him?
- Someone called Arul Kumaran
INTERMlSSlON
MLA's party men and the press are anxiously waiting..
..to know his condition What can we tell them?
- I will tell them
- Sir what happened?
Your husband is alright
All of you need not worry
I will give you all details after one hour
"Doctor, why did you lie to them?"
"He is very bad The guy who has hit him, Arul is good"
If the cause of death is revealed
Arul's life will be spoilt by litigations
"So, we must create an atmosphere for two days that he is alive"
All of you must co-operate for that
"Save me from the evil eyes, God!"
You are chattering again
Go see Hürrem Sultana.
She wants to see you
Run to your main Sultana
My son
My Mehmet
What's wrong?
Why are you sad?
I went to mosque with my father
How nice!
"But everyone said "" long live Mustafa "" Noone said anything for me"
They don't know you yet my son
You are little yet
"But when they recognise you, they'll shout out your name the most"
İbrahim will teach Mustafa Italian
I wanted to learn too.
But he said no
Don't be sad my lion
Your mother will teach you everything
Go inside now
The most unique of the Sultanas.
May you order
Order what?
You said to Esma that you want to say something
My Sultana you told me to have my eyes opened and to inform you if I hear anything important
Say it
A huge grant is given to Maidevran Sultana to do charity work
Mahidevran Sultana will have buildings built.
"Hans, baths, fountains"
She's giving out gifts to concubines
Is it Valide Sultana's order?
He's going!
Take them away.
"Sister Renata, we have forced your foes to forsake the bodies of your sisters."
But we have discovered you are in a sinful pact with the devil.
"Confess your sin, apostate!"
I am not guilty of the sin which you have named.
Woe is us!
Get away from us!
"Sisters, come to your senses!"
Holy Sister Renata!
Holy Sister Renata!
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
"- Back, insidious spirit!"
"You are the pure, innocent bride of a celestial angel."
"Pray for us, save us, deliver us from the Devil."
"Pray for us, Sister Renata!"
"Intercede for us, Sister Renata!"
From this sister came all misfortunes.
From this sister came all devilish intrigues.
"Malign spirits, condemned and prohibited, banished, exiled,"
"I command and charge you, in the blinking of an eye, depart all of you who purvey iniquity..."
"You are holy and without sin, you save us sinners."
Sisters!
Sister Renata!
- Get away from me!
"Have pity, dark one!"
"Have pity, base one!"
"Have pity, terrible one!"
"Have pity, dreadful one!"
Have pity!
"Get out, black one!"
I want one of our own
"If this is not bat, and looks good to you"
I can't understand what for you want another flat
Given how much it costs
"Well man, our own flat is our own flat"
Do whatever you want
But fuck
I can't see any logic if this one is so fine
It looks like you want to live in a palace
- No
Do you want to smoke?
- No
I don't feel like smoking
Are you sleepy?
- Yeah
If you want I'll turn the lights and well get some sleep
After the cigarrette is over
"You were born in La Ciega, weren't you?"
"Yes, that's where I grew up"
Do you like it?
- I like it very much
It's so pretty
You're so pretty
It's very beautiful I like it very much
"Yeah, indeed"
But just to stay a little while and then go
To hell with it
Be patient with grandma
What a surprise is the old lady going to get
I might be out of place here
Out of place?
You're my woman
This world will be better off without you.
One less Divergent ruining everything.
"And no one will ever, ever forgive you for what you've done."
You're wrong.

ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Initializing message.
Hello.
I come from outside the wall.
Where we have all but destroyed each other.
We designed your city as an experiment.
We believe it is the only way to recover the humanity we have lost.
And we created factions to ensure peace.
But we believe there will be those among you who will transcend these factions.
These will be the Divergent.
They are the true purpose of this experiment.
They are vital to humanity's survival.
"If you're watching this now, then at least one of you is proof that our experiment has succeeded."
The time has come for you to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.
We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.
But you're not.
Mankind waits for you with hope
beyond the wall.
You Okay?
"Tony, where are you?"
He's coming in again.
I can only see a light.
That's all.
Now it's...
Going black.
Now it's...
Completely gone.
[machines beeping]
He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes
As he struggles to regain consciousness.
"His output is so great,"
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.
But he's dangerous.
"Once I have control of his brain, Letha,"
He will only be dangerous to others.
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
"My experiments are more important than the law, Letha."
"With these receptors placed on certain people,"
"Combined with this boy's powers,"
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.
"Oh, you are absolutely brilliant, professor."
"Now we can go ahead with my plans, too."
Don't bother me with your plans.
"They're empty, unimportant."
"A comment, perhaps, on you and the life you've been leading."
"Now, you look here,"
"Doctor, professor, physicist."
Whatever you are.
I built this laboratory for you at great expense.
I used every penny I had.
DICAPRIO:
Nearly a quarter of a century of global climate talks have come to this pivotal moment in Paris.
195 countries saying they'll do everything in their power to change.
[French President].
[APPLAUSE]
DICAPRIO:
There's no doubt that this agreement is a massive step forward.
But does it go far enough?
REPORTER:
"The Paris Agreement calls for keeping climate warming to well below two degrees Celsius, while striving for 1.5."
REPORTER:
"There's no mention of a carbon tax, there's no mention of any penalties."
REPORTER:
There are no enforcement provisions.
DICAPRIO:
We just have to take it on faith that all these countries are gonna follow through with what they say.
How likely is that?
FOX NEWS:
This is an unattainable deal that Congress has already voted to reject.

OBAMA:
You doing alright?
DICAPRIO:
"In my opinion, a Candor trial would have the greatest chance of achieving true justice."
So are you asking me to petition the Council to grant Candor sole judiciary power?
No.
"As part of Candor's initiation, you administer a truth serum."
Correct?
We don't typically discuss such matters out of faction.
That's a pretty evasive answer.
Evasion is not dishonest.
It's not exactly honesty either.
Yes.
We possess such a serum.
Then use it on us.
- Four.
"-if we're guilty, we'll surrender to the Council."
All right?
"If not, you've just saved two lives."
And made some loyal allies.
JACK:
All right.
But you should know that the serum can be quite brutal.
It was designed for Candor applicants who are already predisposed to honesty.
Not everyone finds it so easy to share their secrets.
Don't wanna do this.
We have to.
Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
May the truth set you free.

All I have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life.
But my mother is determined to see me distinguished.
Orator.
Politician.
Even a barrister would do.
If I drove a barouche.
What do you wish for?
"I prefer the church, but that is not smart enough for my mother."
"She prefers the army, but that is too smart for me."
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.
Country living is my ideal.
A small parish where I might do some good.
Keep chickens...
Give very short sermons.
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -
- When one has no choice of any occupation whatsoever.
Our circumstances are therefore precisely the same.
Except that you will inherit your fortune.
We cannot even earn ours.
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy is our only option.

She's wondering
Then place them immediately
You should be there too
Just in case Hatice won't faint
Welcome my Sultana

Yeung:
We wanted to know whether insect-resistant
"And roundup-tolerant crops were working as advertised,"
So we went to meet up with some soy farmers.
♪
What kind of soy do you grow here?
Yeung:
Have you had any challenges using gm soy?
(speaking foreign language)
♪
So none of these weeds were here when you weren't using gm?
Yeung:
We found these roundup-resistant super weeds
Cropping up on all the soy farms we visited.
How many of these do you normally have?
(speaking foreign language)
Yeung:
And it isn't just the weeds that are getting stronger.
"In some cases, the bugs are too."
Ooh!
What are these?
(speaking foreign language)
So when did you start getting a problem with these things?
♪
Yeung:
"To combat these super weeds and pests,"
Farmers are forced to use larger quantities
"Of other, more potent chemicals."
"So locals call this thing the mosquito, because it's got a huge wingspan"
That just sprays huge amounts of glyphosate all over these soy farms.
"Even though this gmo system is becoming less effective,"
"It's being implemented over so much land,"
Does Valide Sultana know about them?
No
If my Valide sees them she'd be upset
"With your permission,"
It is not worthy of you but...

It brought me luck during my pregnancies
I hope it will save you too bring you luck

It is gossip.

Would a muslim put icons to his house?
Figani Efendi...
"Well, come and see with your eyes then"
There they are
Now you see them
"Look at them, 3 icons"

"Tables, paintings"

Yes.

Hona GurePlaneta-TBk ikusleengandik jasotako emailak.
"Eskatu genienean osasunean nabaritutako aldaketa ez-ohikoak kontatzeko, aste vbtean ia 500 email jaso genituen."
Sudurretik odol jario handia.
Eten ezinezko diarrea.
Eztarria irritatuta.
Neke handia.
"Ez haurrek bakarrik, adin ezberdinetako jende batzuek ere antzeko sintomak aipatzen dituzte."
"Masamichi Nishio doktorea, Hokkaidoko Kantzer Zentroko burua:"
"Diarrea, nekea, eztarriko mina, odola sudurretan..."
"Jende askok baldin badituzte antzeko sintomak, medikuek ohartu behar dute erradiazio dosi apalen síntoma klinikoak direla."
(emaila:
"""Estomatitisa justu istripuaren ondoren"")."
Ez dituzte mesprexatu behar sukarraldi baten sintomak balira bezala.
"""Txernobyl:"
"Hondamendiaren eraginak gizakietan eta ingurumenean""."
Liburu hau The New York Academy of Sciences-ek argitaratu zuen 2009an.
"Egileak hiru aditu dira, tartean Alexey V. Yablokov doktorea, Bielorrusiakoa, Sobiet Batasunean Gorbatxov presidentearen aholkulari zientifiko izana."
"Aztertu zituzten 2004 aurretik plazaratutako 5.000 txosten zientifiko baino gehiago, ondorioztatuz milioi bat jende hilgo zela istripuaren eraginez."
"Kopuru horrek 20 aldiz bikoizten du ofizialki ICRP erakundeak aipatu izan dituen ""4.000 jendeen heriotzak""."
Yablokov doktoreak ohartarazten du sudurreko odola eta guruin linfatikoen handitzea erradiazioen kalteen sintomak direla.
Ofizialki esan da Txernobylek 4.000 jenderen heriotza ekarri zuela.
Baina horretarako oinarritzen dira ICRP bezala industria nuklearrari lotutako erakundeen txostenetan.
"Ez dago garbi nork duen arrazoi [ICRPk ala Yablokovek], baina bistakoa da bien artean sekulako tartea dagoela."
Nola ulertu tarte hori?
"Begira, ICRPk izendatu zuen batzorde bat gorputz barruko erradiazioak ikertzeko, baina desegin egin zuten."
Zergatik?
Batzorde horrek hainbeste urtean behin azterketa bat egin behar zuelako.
"Baina txosten horretan egia kontatuko balute, gorputz barruko erradiazioen arriskuak azalduko lituzkete, eta ezingo lukete jarraitu energía nuklearra sustatzen."
"Jende asko kaltetu baldin baditu barruko erradiazioak, ... iruditzen zait garaia dela kontutan hartzeko erradiazio mota horren kalteak."
"Bideoan ageri denez, Interneten zabalduta zegoen martxotik ari zela zerbait berezia gertatzen."
"Baina orduan istorio horiek hutsalak edo gezurrezkoak ziruditen, zientzialari batzuek berehala esaten baitzuten aldaketok ez zutela zerikusirik erradiazioekin."
Horrelako giroan jende asko ez zen ausartu hitz egitera edo arazo horien zergaitiak ikertzera.

I was looking for you.
Can we talk?
"1107 01:34:29,867 --&amp;gt; 01:34:32,826 Yes, of course go on!"
"1108 01:34:34,110 --&amp;gt; 01:34:37,311 What happened?"
"1109 01:34:50,200 --&amp;gt; 01:34:52,388 Finally I made it!"
"1110 01:34:53,654 --&amp;gt; 01:34:55,654 Thanks."
"1111 01:34:55,739 --&amp;gt; 01:34:58,024 You won a panda ."
"1112 01:34:58,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:01,200 You must be joking!"
"1113 01:35:05,462 --&amp;gt; 01:35:08,129 You know that Selim did not know about the money?"
"1114 01:35:08,300 --&amp;gt; 01:35:10,100 You did not tell him, No?"
"1115 01:35:10,795 --&amp;gt; 01:35:13,436 How was I suppose to know that it'sa secret?"
"1116 01:35:13,517 --&amp;gt; 01:35:16,158 I wanted to thank him.I thought he knows it too."
"1117 01:35:16,800 --&amp;gt; 01:35:18,300 God damn you, Sude."
"1118 01:35:21,900 --&amp;gt; 01:35:24,300 500.000 dollars..."
"Ender... 1119 01:35:24,509 --&amp;gt; 01:35:26,867 I'm talking about 500.000 dollars... 1120 01:35:26,921 --&amp;gt; 01:35:29,467 More money that I earn in a year."
"1121 01:35:29,600 --&amp;gt; 01:35:31,800 I gave my own money.. 1122 01:35:31,990 --&amp;gt; 01:35:34,629 I don't care...Wherever it is from."
"1123 01:35:34,685 --&amp;gt; 01:35:36,686 How can you take so much money and give it?"
"1124 01:35:36,686 --&amp;gt; 01:35:39,015 I gave it to him as loan."
"Even if it's so, you did not tell me."
Why did you hide it from me?
Faruk didn't want the situation to be known.
"AS A WRlTER. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE QUESTlON, I THlNK-- MAYBE IT'S EASlER IN PLAYWRlTING--"
"THE QUESTlON OF ""MY VOlCE."""
"WELL, WHEN YOU'RE WRlTING A PLAY,  YOU HAVE LOTS OF VOlCES."
ALL OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE A VOlCE.
"AND SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GOT A VlLLAlN,"
"WE BOTH ADOPT THE VOlCES OF ""VlLLAlN."" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, SOMEBODY ASKED US, AT ONE POlNT IF, UH, YOU KNOW,"
"HOW, IF YOU WERE COLLABORATlNG,"
YOU COULD SURRENDER YOUR OWN WRlTER'S VOlCE
"AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE COLLABORATlNG ON PLAYS,"
THE ONLY VOlCE OR VOlCES THAT MATTER
ARE THE VOlCES OF THE CHARACTERS.
"IT'S NOT YOUR VOlCE,  IT'S THElR VOlCES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AND THE NlCE THlNG IS,  YOU KNOW,"
WHEN YOU REACH THAT POlNT IN A STORY OR A POEM
"AND YOU'RE PUSHlNG ""CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT?"
"IF YOU'RE COLLABORATlNG,"
THERE'S SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU DEClDE WHAT COMES NEXT.
IT'S ALWAYS EXClTING.
"AND AGAlN, YOU GOTTA TRUST THE TALENT OF THE PERSON"
"WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WORKlNG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF, UH, YOU DO HAVE ANY QUESTlONS  ABOUT ANYTHlNG,"
"UH, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK."
"WE DO HAVE SOME  HANDOUTS FOR YOU,"
"SO YOU SHOULDN'T GO AWAY EMPTY-HANDED. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; OH, RlGHT-- OH, RlGHT. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH, WE'VE GOT-- YOU KNOW,  WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU TALK, I'LL DO THlS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE IMPORTANCE OF FORMAT..."
HOW A PLAY  LOOKS ON THE PAGE
AND HOW LONG IT TAKES-- A MlNUTE PER PAGE.
"WE GAVE YOU A LlTTLE EXCERPT FROM A LONGER PLAY,"
AND WE ALSO GAVE YOU-- OR ARE GOlNG TO GlVE YOU--
WHAT WE TALKED  ABOUT EARLlER
ABOUT GETTlNG STARTED WlTH WRlTING PLAYS.
"THERE'S A SlNGLE SHEET. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (indistinct speaking). &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (indistinct speaking). &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, MARYANNE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (indistinct speaking)."
Bunty.
"- Yes, Sweetie."
This is for you.
"YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD SAlD SOMETHlNG ABOUT SPEAKlNG BRlEFLY"
ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."
Zuek kasu asko ikusi dituzue kontsultak antolatu zenituztenetik.
Guk ere informazio asko jaso ditugu ikusleetatik.
Emaiozue begiratu bat mapa honi...
Hemen saikatu ditugu jaso ditugun 550 informeak.
"Ikus dezakezunez, síntoma ohikoenak dira eztarriko gorabeherak, zehazkiago, eztarri minbera."
Hirutik batek aipatzen du arazo hau.
"Bigarrena da sudurreko odol jarioa, %20 inguruk daukate."
"Ez bakarrik haurrek, baina 30, 40, 50 edo 60koek ere, edozein adinetakoek."
"Hirugarren síntoma ohikoena, diarrea."
Eta ondoren neke handia.
Kausak ez dira identifikatu oraindik.
Baina kezkatu nintzen ikusi nuenean 500 jendeotatik bakoitzak antzeko sintomak zituela.
Zer uste duzu emaitz horiez?
"Begira, Txernobyl inguruetan leku kutsatuetan bizi diren haurren artean sarri ikusi ditugun sintomak dira."
Horregatik ez nintzen harritu.
"Ez da harritzekoa, zeren eta gure gainean sekulako erradiazio kopurua erori baita."
Japoniako doktoreak ez daude ohituta gorputzean arnastuta edo irentsita sartutako errazioarekin.
"Horregatik, norbait ohartzen denean zerbait ari zaiola gertatzen osasunean eta erradiazioagatik dela... ... ospitalera jotakoan doktoreek esango diote urduriegi dagoela, edo ez diote entzungo."
"Horregatik jo dute jende horiek Internetera, edo gure webgunera."
"Ospitaleko diagnostikoarekin ez bazaituzte konbentzitzen, hobe duzu sospetxatzea zure arazoak erradiazioarekin duela zerikusia."
Batez ere orain.
Ez da harrigarri guri emailak bidali dizkigutenetatik gehienak ospitalera ez joan izana.
"Sudurretik odoletan ari zarelako ez zoaz ospitalea, ala?"
Ezta jarioa handia bada ere.
Ospitalera diarrea larriarekin iritsitako askori diarrea birikoa diagnostikatu zioten.
Baina birusen testak negatibo ematen zuen.
Quite a few people came home with the cause of their problems unidentified.
"As has been the case with ""A-bomb bura bura disease"" and Chernobyl-related health problems, medical tests don't reveal any abnormalities for such symptoms."
"If you take a blood test, nothing abnormal is found."
But the medicine you got won't stop your diarrhea.
"So the doctor, not knowing what to do, keep giving you stronger medicines or antibiotics."
"But if the cause is radiation, medicines are hardly effective and the mdical tests don't reveal any abnormalities."
"5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there."
"And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23."
"So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3."
"Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4 is going to be divisible by 12."
"And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors."
15 is the same thing as 3*5.
"So once again, we already have 3 and 5."
"So, this is our least common multiple (LCM)."
"So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180"
"So, our LCM is 180."
"So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator."
"So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?"
"To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20."
"So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20."
"Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20."
4*20 = 80.
"So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180."
"Now, let's do 3/4."
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
4*45 = 180.
"Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45."
3*45 = 135.
"So, 3/4 equals 135/180."
Now let's do 4/5.
"To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36."
"Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36."
"So, 144/180."
And then we have only two more to do.
180/12 = 15.
"Same for numerator, 15."
"So, 11/12 = 165/180."
"OK, so that means that P and Q are equidistant from this"
"line, so that means that this distance is equal to this distance."
"When they say P and Q are symmetric around AB, you can almost pretend like AB's a mirror right here, and P and Q are the mirror images of each other."
Good enough.
And then it also says points Q and R are symmetric around line CD.
So we also know that this distance is equal to this distance.
Good enough.
What is the length of PR?
This is fascinating.
So let's say that this length right here-- let me do it in yellow-- this length is x.
Then what is this green length going to be?
This green length right here is going to be 4 minus x.
How did I know it was 4 minus x?
"Well, this distance up here is 4."
So this is x.
This is 4 minus x.
"Well, then this distance right here is also going to be 4 minus x."
"And if this yellow distance is x, then we also know that this distance is x."
"So the distance from P to R is going to be the sum of all of these, right? x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x."
And I think you see where this is going.
It's x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x.
"These x's all cancel out, right?"
2x minus 2x.
And we're just left with 8.
And that's our answer.
B.
And you could've tried it out.
"You could have assumed Q was right in the middle, and it would have worked out the same, but you know for sure that the answer is 8."
Next problem.
Image clear.
Invert.
I don't know if I'll have time for this.
"And then finally, we have 13/15."
"To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--1510 = 150, 30 remaining for 180."
152 = 30.
"So, 15*12 = 180."
"Multiple numerator by same number, 13."
"We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156."
"So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator."
"Now, it is very easy to compare them."
We only have to look at their numerators.
"Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers."
"The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4."
"And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5."
"Next is 156/180, which was 13/15."
"Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12."
"And, we're done!"
We have finished our ordering.
"HI my name is Allison and I'm the president of Communication Conections,Inc., a nonprofit for families hearing loss.I'm sitting in my favorite place-my garden."
I love all of my flowers.They are beautiful and I have a variety of them.
I work hard to have them grow.
"But my favorite ones are sunflowers.Sure,they are pretty and yellow."
But why do I love sunflowers the most?
It's because they start with such a small seed and you add water and they start to grow.
You add sunlight and they grow more.
"Then all of a sudden,they grow HUGE!"
I was shocked when I saw how big sunflowers grow!
I never knew how big they would grow.
It's kind of t the same for the new nonprofit.
I worked hard for years as a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing children.
I worked for 15 years and I've seen growth and improvement.
"But,I wanted to see a BlG change."
I started with a small idea and decided to set up a nonprofit.
I researched and aksed people to help me.
Shall we play a game while eating?

Jin Se Ryeong's interview isn't over yet.
"Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I plan on getting back to basics.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The place that made me the Jin Se Ryeong of today, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;shouldn't that be my next destination?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Aish!
You refused to listen to me!
"And you just eat! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What is it? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; ♪ When I look into your eyes,  I can't sleep. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; ♪ When I feel your breath,  I am thrilled. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;♪ You're the girl I am so stuck on."

"The kids aren't giving you any more trouble now, are they?"
I heard that there was an accident during the broadcast earlier.
"Ah, yes."
You needn't worry about it.
It is extremely bothersome to deal with kids that powder their faces.
Aigo!
Is the preparation for going public on the KOSDAQ going well?
"Yes, it is going according to plan."
"Nowadays, as soon as you put up a board (sign), you start making preparations to go public or go overseas..."
We are a little late.
It is the most important time now!
Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations.
Yes.
"I will bear that in mind, Chairman."
Ah!
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal to-- what's 50 times 8?
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.
What is this?
"2, 50 times 8."
"Right, that's 400."
"OK, this is 120 plus a 160 is 280."
"280 is equal to 430-- this is a good example-- plus 10F, I just realized."
Subtract 430 from both sides.
So what's 430 minus 280?
It's 150.
So it's minus 150 is equal to 10F.
So F is equal to minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction.
"So F is minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction, or it means that it is 15 Newtons."
"We assumed that it was in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a minus number."
[SNEEZE]
Excuse me.
I apologize if I blew out your speakers with that sneeze.
"But anyway, we assume it was going in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a negative number, so that means it's actually operating in the clockwise direction at 15 Newtons at a distance of 10 from the moment arm."
"Hopefully, that one was less confusing than the last one."
"So let me do another problem, and these actually used to confuse me when I first learned about moments, but in some ways, they're the most useful ones."
So let's say that I have some type of table.
I'll draw it in wood.
It's a wood table.
That's my table.
"And I have a leg here, I have a leg here."
Let's say that the center of mass of the top of the table is here.
It's at the center.
And let's say that it has a weight.
It has a weight going down.
What's a reasonable weight?
Let's say 20 Newtons.
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.
This number line counts by tens.
We have two hundreds; there's the number two hundred.
"Five tens, hmmm... there's different ways we can do that."
Let's just count by tens.
"Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty."
"Five tens and three ones; not three jumps, but three small ones."
"One, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
Let's try two hundred fifty three again because there are a number of ways we can do this.
"Again, our number line is counting by tens."
"We're going to start at two hundred, but this time instead of five tens,  let's do one jump of fifty."
"So, we're at two hundred fifty."
"We need three ones, one, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
"In this lesson you have learned  how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."

"It's me, Beth Hoyt."
It's a big Wednesday show.
"We have not one, but two special guests for you today."
"We've got Julie Klausner, author of the book, ""I Don't"
"Care About Your Band,"" and host of ""The Hit"", and one of my favorite podcasts, ""How Was Your Week?"""
"And if you've listened to ""How Was Your Week?"" Then you've heard the theme song by funny man and indie punk rock legend"
"Ted Leo, who's also here."
"We're going to be playing lots of games, including another round of Fuck, Marry, Kill."
You know how it goes.
"Three names, you know."
Give us some suggestions for that in the chat.
We'll use them.
"First, though, I want to talk about chairs."
Suleiman was killed by Nazif Kara it is a Lie!
I did not kill him!- Silence!
Sit down!
"Please,Sit down, sir."
Nazif.
mrs.
Judge!Suleiman did not tellMahir will be called that particular day.
"I do not have any information,and even claims that it is called the day...I just expected..."
Silence in court!
"But you asked Suleimanto call your sonto talk, right?"
"We know all,even if Nazif Kararefused to meet with your ​​son that you mentioned in your letters."
That's not true!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif!"
She was the one that left my Mahir!
"This woman Kader Alton is the one who left little Mahir,and claims that she is his real mother"
I neverstood between them!
Sit!
Mr. Nazif sit!- She was the one who left Mahirand threw him into the house of my brother!
These are the exact words of Kader father:She never wants to seein the face his brother's killer!
"Sit down, Mr. Nazif,I told you to sit down!"
"Any witnesses what you're saying,Mr. Nazif? is your brother or father stillm alive Mr. Kader to confirm your words? no"
I never saidI do not want to see my son!
Nazif and his familyfiled a lawsuit in order totake him away from me...
They kidnapped memy son!
"Whenever they saw my fatherHow do they pay for it,beat me..."
Every day I said to myself why am I crying for someoneWho does not want me...
I went to file a lawsuitto the police in order to return sonand then they threw meout of the house...
Suleiman was the onlywho stood by mein that difficult days...
"He helped meand opened the door of his house for me , Thus began our relationship..."
Nazif is lying and is again sdtanding between me and Mahir!
Silence in court!
"All right, ma'am."
Wave to each other.
How many work with young people outside of school settings?
"Ah, yes, wave to each other."
How many would like to be working with young people?
(Laughter) Alright.
How many of you are parents?
Look at that.
"Alright, I work with young people who have dropped out of the school systems."
"People from low income background,  ages 16 to 24."
"And what they say to us in the Youth Build program as they come into, is,"
"""They didn't care about us in school."
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, I just want to say, from all  of young people in Youth Build, tens of thousand have been in Youth Build, who have experienced good teachers as I think most of you probably are."
I know that you've started-
"Jon, your blessing to them was very appropriate- you started your career because you want to make a difference, I know that."
"From all the young people in Youth Build who know the teaching makes a difference,"
"I am standing for them to say thank you  very much, it does make a difference."
I am bringing some voices of some young people I work with.
"There are 3.5 million young people  who are between ages 16 to 24, who are out of school, out of work and raised in lower income communities."
"Here is one of them, Mike Dean."
"Well, so much for order."
(Laugh)
I am OK.
(Laughter)
Mike's is in here somewhere.
Staplers are very useful.
(Laughter)
Mike says:
"""I've never had an easy year growing up in Columbus, Ohio."
I lived in a drug-infested home  without a father.
My neighborhood was drown  in confusion and negativity.
The lack of positive goals and dreams led me to a life of crime.
That's what linear dependency means.
That one of them can be represented as a scalar multiple of the other.
"Well if this is true, then I can just substitute this back in for vi."
And what do I get?
I get c times vj-- which is just another way of writing vi because I assumed linear dependence.
That dot vj has got to be equal to 0.
This guy was vi.
This is vj.
They are orthogonal to each other.
But this right here is just equal to c times vj dot vj which is just equal to c times the length of vj squared.
And that has to equal 0.
They are orthogonal so that has to equal 0.
Which implies that the length of vj has to be equal to 0.
"If we assume that this is some non-zero multiple, and this has to be some non-zero multiple-- I should have written it there-- c does not equal 0."
Why does this have to be a non-zero multiple?
Because these were both non-zero vectors.
This is a non-zero vector.
So this guy can't be 0.
This guy has length 1.
"So if this is a non-zero vector, there's no way that I can just put a 0 here."
Because if I put a 0 then I would get a 0 vector.
So c can't be 0.
"So if c isn't 0, then this guy right here has to be 0."
And so we get that the length of vj is 0.
Which we know is false.
The length of vj is 1.
This is an orthonormal set.
The length of all of the members of B are 1.
So we reach a contradiction.
This is our contradiction.
Vj is not the 0 vector.
It has length 1.
So let me do that.
So let me connect the dots as best as I can.
"This should be a line, not a curve."
"My hand isn't 100% steady, but I think you get-- let me do it a little bit better than that."
I think I can do a better job than that.
Let me draw-- that's even worse.
All right.
Last attempt.
That's throwing me off.
So last attempt right here.
There you go.
So that's that first line right there. y is equal to 3x plus 1.
So let me do the second one now.
"So it's written in standard form right now, 2y plus 4 is equal to 6x."
"We want to get this in slope-intercept form, y is equal to mx plus b."
So a good place to start could be to subtract this 4 from both sides.
So it goes on the other side.
So let's subtract 4 from both sides of this equation.
"The left-hand side, we're left with just a 2y, and then the right-hand side becomes 6x minus 4."
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.
"And then to get everything in terms to solve for y, we just have to divide everything by 2."
"So let's divide everything by 2, and we get y is equal to 3x minus 2."
So that's the second equation in slope-intercept form.
So same drill here.
The y-intercept is negative 2.
"So we go-- that's negative 1, negative 2 right there, and its slope is 3."
And notice its slope is the same as the other line.
So it's going to have the same inclination.
"If we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3 in the y-direction."
"1, up 3."
Just like that.
"If we go back 1 in x, we go down 3."
"Well, when the Bradley went down, I flew the guy named Don Hanson."
He was a pilot... coming here all the time.
He had a nice Cessna-180 and the first day...
I have the radio in the basement now.
"Every year, the guy that owns Zenith, it was a fish dock."
Him and my grandfather become really good friends.
From like 1920s or right whenever they started.
"Every time Zenith made a new radio, come out with a different model he gave him a free radio."
He came up in the summer and gave him a new one.
There were Zenith radios with their eyes and everything all over.
And I got the last one.
"Says ""Made expressly for and stolen from"
"Jim Gallagher."" My grandfather's name."
"But anyway, we'd listen to it all night."
We could hear them search and stuff.
"Another uncle of mine, Jack Colton, is in Charlevoix."
He's going to have his 90th birthday here this fall.
He was the exec in the [?].
"And when the call came in, he just took off out with half a crew."
The indicator that tells him it's [?] was painted on both sides.
The engine.
I've been in the basement of one of them
They have different settings.
They're diesel electric.
You go up to like 10 is wide open and then you can push a button and get it up to like twelve.
They went out like that.
Emergency power all the way to Gull Island.
"Those gales, you know nasty."
But the next day I flew with Don and they plowed the runway and just about started to ... up to about that part of the runway.
And it was just slush.
And we took in - As we were getting close to it
The Bradley?
That sounds nifty!
"I think I'll head to the writing center right now!"""

"The Dover Boys at Pimento University or ""The Rivals of Roquefort Hall"""
Pimento University
Pimento U.
"Good old P.U. ♪ Pimento U. Oh, sweet P.U. ♪ ♪ Thy fragrant odor scents the air. ♪ ♪ A pox on Yale. ♪ ♪ Poo poo, Perdue. ♪ ♪ Pimento U., my college fair. ♪"
"Out and away, the most popular fellows at..."
"Out and away, the most popular fellows at old P. U. are the three Dover boys."
"Tom, the fun-loving member of the trio."
"Dick, a serious lad of 18 summers, plus a winter in Florida, as related in The Dover boys in the Everglades."
"And Larry, the youngest of the three jerks... brothers."
"A gay outing at the park has been planned by the merry trio and they are off to fetch their fiancée, Dainty Dora Standpipe at Miss Cheddars' female academy, close by."
"With their usual punctuality, the boys arrive at the appointed hour of 3:00."
Yoohoo!
Yoohoo!
Yoohoo!
And are soon on their rollicking way.
"Forced to pass a certain public house, a tavern of unsavory repute, our young friends meet the distressing situation with their usual uncompromising, moral fortitude."
"Little do they know that even now, within this very tavern,"

"Dear, rich, Dora Standpipe!"
How I love her... father's money.
Confound those Dover boys!
"Oh, how I hate them!"
I hate Tom!
I hate Dick!
"Because in this case, n could be-- could this would be n and this is would be n plus 1-- so n is either equal to 2 or n is equal to minus 3."
That's a little tricky.
The intuition is to just assume that n is positive but it doesn't have to be positive.
So n could be 2 or minus 3 here.
That's a tricky one.
So that one by itself does not help us solve the problem.
"The second part of it, point two it says, 2 to the 2n is equal to 16."
"And whenever you have these in the SAT or the GMAT or anything whenever you have a variable in the exponent, your goal really is to just get everything in the same base."
So we could write the left-hand side the same.
So that's 2 to the 2n.
And how do we write 16 with the base 2?
"Well, 16 is just 2 to the fourth, right?"
And so we get 2n is equal to 4. n is equal to 2.
So this statement alone is enough to figure it out.
This statement alone is not.
So the answer is B.
Statement two alone is sufficient.
40 is B.
"And this was tricky because one, you think that 1n alone is sufficient but it is ambiguous because and n could be minus 3."
41.
41.
OK.
"They've drawn a bunch of, if I see this right,"
They draw a bunch of-- two lines.
Let's see if I can draw this.
So a line and then there's a bunch of circles.
"One circle, two circles they have, and then they keep going."
"Three circles, and then one more."
It's going to be right there.
Four circles.
I think that's about right.
And they say essentially that the circles just keep going on and on.
Neždet. her sisteranswered the phone?
I spoke with her
"Kader Altun,of all those letters that you sentto your son, are missing, right?"
"Maybe theylost in the mail,"
It probably happenedBefore I sent them to my niece in Trabzon. did you ever mention in any of these lettersyour relationship withmr.
Sulejman?
Never!I never mentioned it
"Nazif from Trabzonwas very honored one . to tell him about my relationshiplt would hurt him,and also make him so angry."
"How can we comprehend,you have not to mention it To protect Suleiman's life?"
"Not at all,"
I did not writebecause it was inappropriate...
In the town where I'm fromthey do not accept easilythis kind of relationship.
Maybe Nazif Kara learned about your relationship from someone else?Is that possible?
Maybe some offriend or relative?
No.Nobody knewabout our relationship.
"Many years passedsince I escapedfrom his family,"
"That's why I changed the name,I never used the name Kader,only Nihan"
So I couldnot be found.
mrs.
"Kader,you came to the court on the day of the murder.Why did you come?"
That was the day ofMahir engagement...
I wentand saw my son from a distance...
It is so difficultfor a mother not to benear her only sonon such a beautiful day.
I stood thereas a foreigner...
Then I wentby Suleiman cryand share my pain with him.
Suleiman was alwaysvery compassionate and promised to help meto meetwith my son...
He promised me he would call Mahirand called him to come totalk to him.
"Wait a minute,just a little bit..."
So that was the reasonwhy Suleiman sent the policeto bring in Mahir Kara that day?
I do not know...but I think so...
He promised to call him... mr.
"Judge,This explains everything!Nazif Kara went instead Mahir to prevent the mother to meet her son forever"
And they're both going to be negative because their sum is negative.
And there's something interesting here.
49 is a perfect square.
"Its factors are 1, 7, and 49."
"So maybe 7 will work, or even better, maybe negative 7 will work."
And it does!
Negative 7 times negative 7 is 49.
And negative 7 plus negative 7 is negative 14.
"We have that pattern there, where we have 2 times a number, and then we have the number squared."
This is a perfect square.
"This is equal to x minus 7, times x minus 7, is equal to 0."
Don't want to forget that.
Or we could write this as x minus 7 squared is equal to 0.
So this was a perfect square of a binomial.
"And if x minus 7 squared is equal to 0, take the square root of both sides."
You'll get x minus 7 is equal to 0.
"I mean, you could say x minus 7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0."
But that'd be redundant.
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.
"Add 7 to both sides, and you get x is equal to 7."
Only one solution there.
Let's do another one in pink.
Let's say we have x squared minus 64 is equal to 0.
Now this looks interesting right here.
A bell might be ringing in your head on how to solve this.
"This has no x term, but we could think of it as having an x term."
We could rewrite this as x squared plus 0x minus 64.
"So in this situation, we could say, OK, what two numbers, when I multiply them, equal 64, and when I add them equal 0?"
"And when I take their product, I'm getting a negative number, right?"
This is a times b.
It's a negative number.
So that must mean that they have opposite signs.

"This one here... the teacher, is my husband, Mario Portela."
We got married in 1976.
For me it was stupid having a white wedding because I wasn't a virgin.
But you know people.
Sometimes you must pretend to be what you are not.
"I had already made love with Mario for the first time on October 3, 1975."
It was beautiful.
Though I haven't got the photo.
And this thin kid here is Sebastian Garcia.
"When he was 16 years old, the ""Triple A"" kidnapped him."
"The ""Argentine Anticommunist Alliance""."
They said he was a subversive.
He went to a rally and they took his picture.
"The thing is when they tortured him, the poor kid, they wanted names and he didn't know what to say."
"So they used a cattle prod because he was silent, and he just said the first thing that came into his head."
"The names of his classmates, his teacher..."
I remember coming home that day.
"They'd broken the door down, they grabbed me, and I saw Mario with a hood over his head."
"Amanda, you don't have to tell me this, or hurt yourself."
"No, honey, you're wrong there."
This doesn't hurt.
It shouldn't hurt me.
What I...
You know what hurt most?
"Not the cattle prod, or being raped, or that son-of-a-bitch... flaying the soles off my feet with a razor blade..."
What hurt most was seeing Mario alive for the last time.
They brought him back after a session... two or three minutes...
"I remember he looked bad, and I thought I must look like that too."
Like looking in a mirror.
He could barely stand up.
His body was mangled.

In my home I'm in the midst of so many enemy in there.

"And for me, today... all day long, nothing really happened."

"-Yeah, that's it."
Ballz to you!
"Yeah, now that clip's been floating around, it was posted like three days ago and suddenly it's everybody's catchphrase."
-Balls to you!
-Now I don't know why she said it.
I don't know the context.
"I can't imagine what the interviewer could've asked her to get her to say,"
-Balls to you!
-But everyone told me the rest of the interview went normal and that...
-Balls to you!
"-Was just one soundbite and she wasn't yelling, ""Balls to you"" to everyone."
"I mean, I would've yelled it to everyone, but she didn't."
But I'm on board.
Balls to you is hilarious.
"It's probably the best video that you've ever watched, you just don't realize it yet."
"Don't worry, you'll get it in like a week."
"You'll wake up in the middle of the night like,"
"""Oh, balls to me."""
And I sincerely hope that one of those YouTube guys makes a Balls To You remix.
"-Balls to you, b-balls to you"
"-Yeah, or something like that."
"Come on, balls to you doesn't have to be insulting."
It could be a term of endearment.
"Balls to you guy, sir."
[chuckles]
"Balls to you, sir."
Now I remember you guys sent me this video like a year ago and I thought it was funny but I didn't get time to review it.
"But now suddenly the video's blown up, which suggests that it aired on TV somewhere."
Now the concept of the video is simple.
"A couple of stoners roll up to Taco Bell and order their food, but you know, as Elmo."

"Of course, it was slushy"
He touches the brakes - his right brake is froze up.
No brake.
"So, he's doing this with the 180."
You can see he's going to - didn't want to do something.
"So he said, ""Okay, hang on Brian."""
We're getting from here to the water or whatever it is.
"And he hit the rudder the other way, goosed it and shut the one brake flipped it around and goosed it."
We literally backed up to stop like that.
That was some pretty cool flying.
But I used to fly all the time with Joe.
We'd run over to the other island and we'd check and see if -
We hold all the mail on the freights from the airplane so he'd have two loads to do.
I'd jump in with him and
I'd handle the plane when I was twelve years old on the way back to Charlevoix sometimes.
I did get interested in the Air Force with stuff like that.
You actually handled a plane at twelve years?
"Oh yeah, he just flipped it over onto 195 to cross over."
I took a run at it.
"Not good, I'm sure."
But then the next day we'd help Johnny at a Model A pickup.
We all had
Model As.
"Not all of us, but 6, 7 of us had Model As."
So we went over to... the bodies at the Coast Guard station.
So we went over and picked up a map

Let me see.
Copy and paste it.
Let me copy and paste the next several problems.
We could just move-- be streamlined about it.
"OK, they all fit."
Good enough.
What is the equation of the line that has slope of 4 and passes through the point 3 comma minus 10?
"So if the slope is 4, we know that the line-- so just rewrite it in slope y-intercept form again. mx plus b."
They're telling us that the slope is 4.
So we know the equation of the line is y is equal to 4x plus the y-intercept.
And then we could figure out the y-intercept by substituting in this point that they say it goes through.
So it goes through the point 3 comma negative 10.
So y is equal to minus 10 when x is equal to 3.
So 4 times x. x is equal to 3.
Plus b.
So what is that?
That's minus 10 is equal to 12 plus b.
"We could subtract 12 from both sides of this equation, and we get minus 22."
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.
This 12 obviously goes away.
Is equal to b.
"So the equation of our line is y is equal to 4x plus b, which we just figured out is minus 22."
4x minus 22.
That's choice A.
Problem 30.
"The date in the table show the cost of renting a bicycle by the hour, including a deposit."
"If hours, h, were graphed on the horizontal axis-- let me see if I can draw that."
"So that is on the horizontal axis I have hours, h."
So this is h.
"And costs were graphed on the vertical axis, so let me draw the vertical axis."
So cost is on the vertical axis.
What would be the equation of the line that fits the data?
"I say, ""Time out."
"Stop."""
"You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two."
"There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense."

"""This is crazy."
"We can't do this."""
"And Albert's like, ""What?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."""
"And he said ""Well, that's how we do it."""
"And I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"""
"And before I even let him explain,"
"I said, ""I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."""
"And he says, ""Like the Humane Society?"""
"And I said, ""Yes, like the Humane Society."

"Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress."
"And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, ""Albert, how long?"
"When does he get up?"""
"He's like, ""A day."""
"I said, ""A day!"
"How long does it take them to fall off?"""
You have to do 3 minus i over 3 minus i.
"I'm doing that because when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you end up actually with a real number."
Then you're going to end up with a complex number up here.
"A conjugate, all it means is you keep the real part the same, and you change the sign on the imaginary part."
That's all that word means.
"All right, now let's figure out what this is equal to."
"2 times 3, just same distributive properties as always."
Let me do it in green.
2 times 3 is 6.
"2 times minus i is minus 2i, all of that over 3 times 3 is 9."
3 times minus i is minus 3i. i times 3 is plus 3i.
"Then i times minus i, you can view that as minus i squared."
Let's think about what this is equal to.
"Well, this plus 3i and the minus 3i cancel out."
What's i squared?
"Well, this is equal to negative 1."
So you end up with a minus of a negative 1.
Minus a negative 1 is a plus 1.
So you're left with 6 minus 2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.
"Actually, we can reduce this some."
We can divide the top and the bottom by 2.
So that becomes 3 minus i over 5.
We just divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
That is choice B.
"Problem 29, these go fast."
No systems of equations and all that.
What is the product of the complex numbers 3 plus i and 3 minus i?
They just asked us that.
That was in the last problem.
"When we multiplied 3 plus i times 3 minus i, what did we get?"
We got 10.
We did this whole thing.
But that was some of the stuff.
"There's a lot of routine stuff, a lot of fun."
Different countries.
50-something countries I got into.
"You can see just, some of them listed and..."
"Bangkok, Tokyo, got all that stuff over there in Vietnam"
Different things.
Fun.
I almost stayed in but there were some conflicts and I didn't...
Conflicts with - ?
"At home here, little things were going on."
"If I had stayed in, at Staff Sergeant, I had orders direct from headquarters from Air Force by name."
They were going to ship the first squad of 130s over to Vietnam.
And I was the instructor.
"And there was another guy who just - he had probably 5 or 6 years, he was just a little more than me, and he would have been the NCOlC in charge, and I would have been in charge of instructing and creating the instructions."
"As soon as I put my foot there, the job called for"
"Master Sergeants, both jobs."
"And the Air Force can fill them with one rank less, if they didn't have a Master"
Sergeant.
"So they guaranteed me Tech Sergeant, so I would have been in the Air Force four and a half years, and would have been Tech"
Sergeant.
"And, hell, this guy was retired with that."
"But, maybe I wouldn't have come out of Vietnam either."
But that wasn't the reason I got out.
Different things were going on at the time.
So about what year did you get out?
The end of '64.
The end of August.
I was just in for four years.
Two thousand hours flying time and another... other airplanes too.
"When you got out, where did you come to?"
I went to Grand Rapids and stayed with one of my sisters.
It's not because of that...&amp;gt; get in..
"By the way I am sorry,yesterday your night was destroyed because of us."
It wasn't my night.- Your date with Eylul was left incomplete.
"It was not for me, Mert and Eylul had a date."
Mert didn't want to be alone as it was the first time and I had to do it.
I understood.
Ehh?...
What are we doing now?
"In fact this is the whole bazaar but there are two more places i can show, or we can go... if you want"
Then show me ...
I will be pleased... !
I wish I could see your home too.
"Okay, you're a very stubborn!"
Are you hungry?
"In fact, I didn't eat properly since yesterday."
"Let's go then, I will take you to eat the best meatballs you can ever eat in your life.&amp;gt; Okay."
It's superb..
"There is no one,who doesn't enter if this smell gets on his nose,if there is money in the pocket,can't escape this place"
Excuse me!
"- Tell me , what do you need?"
"Please , sister."
Can we have some red pepper flakes - Of course- And from those little pickle peppers if you have.
I'll bring it right away.
Shall I ask for one more portion from the grill?
"In fact my stomach is full , but my eye not."
I will share it together.
"Master, can you prepare another one in the grill please?"
"The engine is ruined , master."
"it can't be repaired, it has to be changed."
"You talk with that man, if he agrees we will get it done."
"No, impossible, it can't be done before a week."
We also had a place where we ate meatballs in the way Bodrum.
Because it is one of the best music schools of the world.
They accept very few students.

"You also go as soon as possible, I will send these to a reeve..."
"Look here, don't act like this!"
"See, he is in a good mood."
He came to see you from a distance.
"He is in beautiful cars,with beautiful girls.What do you want more?"
He has a real job!
I won't tell your brother you are here.
He has an opportunity to save his life.
He will take exams for a scholarship at university .. and I don't want anything to distract Yaman until then.
"Lawyer, you tell Yaman I want to see him,"
let him decide whether he will come.
You can see him only at the end of the month.
Then find a way so they keep me here until the end of the month.
"Mr. Selim, please."
"Soon I will be in front of the committee, they will send me back to jail."
"I think they should send you there, because you're more intelligent than me..."
Stay in jail like a man for 11 months.
Don't involve your brother too.
"Just this morning you were ranting man, what changed now?"
"I came back from a big mistake, Yaman."
Eylul didn't betray Mira.
Thank God.
"It would have been sad if I wasted two videos and ended up with a careless, negative number."
Anyway.
"So now we have s squared plus a squared, over s squared, times y is equal to this."
Multiply both sides times s squared over-- s squared plus a squared.
"Divide both sides by this, and we get y is equal to 1 over s squared-- And actually, let me make sure that that is right."
"It's 1 over s squared. y is equal to 1 over s squared, times s squared, over s squared plus a squared."
And then these cancel out.
And let me make sure that I haven't made another careless mistake.
Because I have a feeling I have.
Yep.
There.
I see the careless mistake.
And it was all in this term.
"And I hope you don't mind my careless mistakes, but I want you to see that I'm doing these things in real time and"
"I am human, in case you haven't realized already."
"Anyway, so I made the same careless mistake."
"So I factor out an e to the minus st here, so it's plus."
But it was a over s squared.
So this is an a.
That's an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
Right?
This was an a.
And this is the correct answer. a over s squared plus a squared.
So I hope those careless mistakes didn't throw you off too much.
These things happen when you do integration by parts twice with a bunch of variables.
"But anyway, now we are ready to add a significant entry into our table of Laplace transforms."
"And that is that the Laplace transform-- I had an extra curl, there."
That was unecessary.
"When they got back to [?] and found out about three days later, the nun gets a letter from the - the nun that was the principal there and she'd never want to see us here at Beaver"
Island again.
"All we did was, they had Lloyd's cabin out there"
A bunch of the cabins like that.
And the chaperones are in one and the kids are in one.
So Gary and I and a couple of - we just showed up and we went and had refreshments for them until about 5 in the morning.
"Poor kids get on the boat, and Dad was on the boat going over to Charlevoix at the time."
He was the manager.
I had to go over for some reason or other.
I forget what the reason was.
It was rougher than hell.
So I just called the airplane.
I flew.
I wasn't gonna take the boat.
So I get over there and get cleaned up and everything.
I hadn't had enough sleep either.
You had to hollow them all down.
Now you got them all partied up and we had to take them all down to the boat.
The students at the party we went to all night.
"So, your high school class was hollowing what students now?"
The students from [?] that were over here - going back and forth to visit.
So then I got to Charlevoix because I'm down at the dock.
The old man was catching the line and stuff.
I'm looking up and here they are.
And they are green.
Some thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.
I ... at a cattle sale.
A restaurant there.
Because they're working in the restaurants and stuff like that.
It was - I thought I was in love with this one but she was pretty rich so that didn't help any.
For the night.
We had a dance you know.
But are the points in the number line still there?
"Yes, they are embedded in Q, right?"
"So, you might wanna say how Z is embedded in Q. Ok?"
"So, we want these pairs to extend Z so that..."
"Ok, which classes will correspond to Z... to the elements of the natural numbers?"
"What will I... if I... give me the number five, what class would you hope that it somehow associated with?"
"Yeah, how about five over one, so that, for instance, n over one in Q corresponds to n in Z."
So this is the other thing that we might hope for in our construction.
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, if you've taken an Algebra course, then what we are looking for is an isomorphism of a..."
Z into Q.
"But, if you don't know these words yet, that's ok."
"Ok, so tell me what the equivalence relation should be."
"So, after grade school, or after enough examples, we see that, what?"
"Q is the set of all, let's say, m over n..."
"Here's a def... here's a... these are equivalence classes... such that m, n are in Z, n is not zero, where m over n is an equivalence class of a... is the equivalence class of m coma n with the relation..."
What relation?
"Ok, tell me when p... two things, two ordered pairs are equivalent."
When will p coma q be equivalent to m coma n?
Steve.
[Student speaking].
Good!
This is otherwise known as the... what are some name...
You cross multiply to check whether fractions are the same...
Yes that's the equivalence relation...
So with this relation these are equivalent if... if what conditions are true?
Steve suggested doing what?
"Let's take p times n, and check whether it's the same as what? q times n."
And what else?
Let's just demand that n and q not be zero.
Ok?
"40 would be for the average female adult, 50 would be for the average male adult."
"But it's funny, we don't tell that to kids."
"I only learned this recently myself, too."
"Going through my whole life, and never really bothering to find out."
And nobody ever bothered to tell me.
"It's like saying,"
"""Here, have the keys to my car, go pick up some stuff for me, go get my groceries."" But I didn't teach you how to drive the car."
"Teaching kids, ""You got to eat it"", but not teaching them how, or how much."
"Now, again, let me show you how easy it is to get protein."
Especially here in the United States.
"Your standard American diet for breakfast, you got your bacon, you got your cow's milk, and you got your hen periods."
How many slices of bacon would you want?
"I know you might not eat bacon now, but how many slices do you remember as a kid, maybe?"
"Maybe 2, OK?"
Each slice is 5 grams.
Two times five.
How many eggs would you want?
2?
Each egg has 6 grams.
So what are we at?
10 + 12 is 22.
How many glass of milk?
One glass.
Each glass has 8 grams.
So you are at what?
30.
"We are not even done with breakfast, this is not including the toast with cow's butter you might put on it."
"So, you are not even done with breakfast, and you are almost at the limit."
"The average American does not need to worry about getting enough protein, they need to worry about getting too much protein."
That's why the U.S. has the highest rates obesity in the entire world.
"And people always tell me, ""Jesus."
What?
"Emily Rose's condition, in fact, was demonic possession."
An exorcism was her only hope for a cure.
Some of you may find yourself unable to reconcile Emily's beliefs... ...or those of the defendant with your own.
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.
"Because you will see that after the utter failure of doctors to help Emily... ...Father Moore simply tried to help Emily in a different way... ...using an approach that he, Emily and her family firmly believed... ...was her only chance for relief."
And we will show that despite his greatest efforts... ...and his sincere love for Emily... *... there was nothing he could've done* *to prevent the death of Emily Rose. *
Are you okay?
Aren't you gonna eat anything?
*She said it was terrible to hear* *the clinking of spoons and forks. *
"She was always hungry, but she said they wouldn't let her eat."
"Who did she mean by ""they""?"
The forces that were in control of her.
That were inside her.
"You know, the demons."
Tell us what else happened that night.
I walked her back to her dorm... ...and she seemed really nervous and scared.
"*So I held her for a while,* *trying to calm her down. *"
"*I fell asleep, but when I woke up,* *she wasn't beside me. *"
Emily?
Hey.
Can you hear me?
"*I called her father, and he told me* *to bring Emily home. *"
*Jason and I put Emily to bed... *
*... hoping she would sleep. *
And when did Father Moore become involved?
Emily stayed home after that.
"She didn't return to school, and she kept getting worse."
"Eventually, when she didn't get better, we called our priest, Father Moore."
"When he arrived, I sent my daughter Alice upstairs..."
*... to see if Emily was awake. *
Emily?
Vandana....
Come.
Do you remember I had told you that... ... a day would come when your son would call you mother?
Come.
"Perhaps you haven't recognised her, sir."
Do you recollect that she had come with Arun for your birthday party?
"Yes, I have recognised her."
But I don't understand how...
Before marrying according to custom he...
And that is why she was unable to accept her son until today.
She bore her troubles alone... ... so that I could become a pilot in the Indian Air Force.
Because she had made a promise to my father.
There are some things that are greater than the limits of society.
You are one of them.
And I think that you should give your son his medal.
I?
A woman who despite losing her husband in an air crash... ... has the courage to make her only son a pilot.
I believe that her son should receive the medal from her.
"Vandana, your years of penance has borne fruit."
Take this.
Mother!
My son!
Today I can hold my head up with pride and say... ... that I do not know how much penance I must have done... ... in order to become the son of a great mother like you.
Your devotion will bear fruit
Do not weep...
Hello!
"Let's take a look at Chapter 6, Consumer Purchasing Strategies and Wise Buying of Motor Vehicles."
"Um, when should you buy?"
And when should you not buy?
"One of the first things I want you to consider when looking at this chapter, when is it better to have the cash and when is it better to go ahead and buy the item now?"
The first thing you need to look at is what is the difference in the cost?
Okay?
"Oh, he's in Grand Rapids."
He's got a good job.
He worked a couple different jobs but he's working with ACI now.
On ComCast - the place in the
He's got about a dozen guys that work for him.
He trucks them all around.
"My daughter, she's an airplane mechanic."
Civilian mechanic for the National Guard in
North Carolina.
But she had to join the Guard to do it.
And she picked up her pilot's license in high school.
Her AMV license at Western.
And went to Alaska and worked on float planes.
DC6s.
"First year there, she got laid off"
She was the head mechanic of the car wash.
"Next year, when she got laid off she went and flew in the - worked mechanic for these"
DC6s at Air Alaska or something like that.
The guy got a 4-engine piston plane.
He flies down to Kodiak and around there.
"She blew it there, in a way"
"I think, because she's a mechanic so she's working as a mechanic and he found out - of course, it's a small outfit, just a dozen planes."
He found out that she had a pilot's license but also the engineer thing.
So there was a panel that - she was an engineer not a flight mechanic.
Flight mechanic was on the 130.
"I could fly - any crew member could fly - flight mechanic get drunk or something like that, I could handle it because all you did was flip a couple fuel switches and some tea handles."
"If you had a fire, you'd just pull the handle."
So that was
"But, if something happened on the ground, well"
"""he's a mechanic,"" you know."
But as far as the flying part of it...
"Anyway, she flew the panel for him and he said, ""You've got a pilot's license."
I called you.
"positive thinking , greeting to you long time could not see you !!"

Scientists are still mystified by how we retrieve our memories.
Each one of us has about 500 trillion synapses in our brain.
"If we could access all of them, it would be like having an entire Library of Congress in your head."
So could solving the mystery of Jill Price and her memory turn us all into living libraries?
"Once again, Diane Sawyer."
"As we now know, Jill Price has a unique brain that can, in effect, relive her life day-by-day, including watching the TV shows she loved."
I tested her memory with random clips.
"This is ""All in the Family."""
Can she guess which episode from a few seconds?
You ain't ugly.
1975.
"She had her baby on the 22nd of December, 1975, and this was right before."
She's right.
"By the way, she once helped work on a retrospective for CBS."
"Like, ""Who shot JR?"""
"And I would explain what was going on, and when it happened, so it is useful in that respect."
What was the date of that episode?
"""Who Shot JR?"" was on March 21, 1980, but we found out who shot JR on November 21, 1980."
[GUNSHOT]
And I could tell you what I was doing in both of those instances.
"The final episode of ""M*A*S*H""?"
"February 28, 1983, and I could tell you what I was doing that day, and it was raining that day too."
And what about theme songs?

Perhaps today is the end of life for one man
Convicted person Nazif Kara...
Do you think my tensionhas to do with what you're saying?
good morning Nurten good morning Orhan
I was going come to you.
What Ayten he doing ?Is not ready yet?Let's go to my dad's hearing she said she would like to go
"No, he's very sick,still sleeping...hardly slept a little last night."
Really?a quck recovery than .
let me knowif you need something.
There is no waythat the patient can get out of bed he just gained consciencehe should not be moved.
This is what we willexplain to the court
"Come to my office,I will give you the necessary paperwork."
Son...will Mahir be able togo to the hearing? no mrs.
"Feride, did you talkto Ms. Nihan?Will she come?"
For today's hearing willneed to have very strong nerves!
"That son of a bitch will not appear today,doctors would not allow it."
"I still think it's better this way,this time he would not has tostand in front of you and make youeven more nervous."
"Feride, are you okay?Can I do something for you?"
Or are you just upsetfor the hearing?
"See you at the hearing,Turgut."
Mr. Attorney!
"I heard that Mahir Karawill not attend the hearing,do you think it's a good or a bad thing? my dear"
"This is our favor,Of course, because a pencilwill be broken today! we will revengeSuleyman's death today!"
Mahir Kara will not comeand no one will be influencing the decision Feride!
"Where is the son in law will he not come god , god"
Two lines.
And what do they do.
"Well, you bring in your initial guess, you bring in your data, and all you gotta do, right, is minimize that sum."
"So all you gotta tell it is, what do you want to minimize."
"Well the sum of remember i've, this x not, our initial guess of a and b."
"And I have ax+b is my guess for my line fit, minus the actual values, square it, sum it."
"Well, I don't need an absolute value here, by the way, right?"
"Because my data is real and I'm squaring it, okay?"
"So, if I had imaginary data, you have to be careful."
Okay?
"So I'm going to go and then it's going to return e, which is there, I'm just trying to minimize this."
"So you've given it a guess: one, one."
And it has an algorithm.
"Okay, so it's a utilization search algorithm."
It just goes to look and say I'm going to change a and b.
In such a way to minimize that thing. okay.
That's it!!!
"Now, if you go to the L-1 case, the only difference is what?"
You don't square it anymore.
"In the L-1 case, what you do, here it is."
"Now I do take the abso lute ? that I'm not squaring I just. ax+b-y, absolute value, sum."
'Kay?
Line fitting.
That's all we're doing.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
Line fitting today?
"So, it seems like we're taking a step backwards."
"We've been recognizing dogs and cats on our computer, and now we're just doing"
line fits?
But there will be an important point to be made.
"Okay, so let's, we got those and here is our thing."
"Since you bought me this washbasin, I'll pay for our meal."
"Go ahead and eat it, Young Master."
I bought one for you too.
Come and eat.
I'll wait outside for you.
I guess I have to eat this then.
Have you stopped going to the government offices and filing reports?
I stopped it because it was useless.
Then do you think stopping Choi Chul Joo's ship will be useful?
You can never tell a lie.
"Young Master, are you... ...going to stop them?"
They can't regain their daughters by stopping the ship.
The parents are doing something foolish because of their own guilt.
They're trying to protect their daughters!
Protect?
They were the ones that sold their daughters off.
"Choi Chul Joo took them, but their parents were the ones that sold them."
They do not know how to protect.
"It's not that they don't know how, it's just that they're powerless."
"I know, because I lost someone too."
I was too powerless to protect that person.
I couldn't go with that person either.
Do you know how painful that is?
You can say that because you're powerful and you've never lost anyone like that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
"When I was young and imprisoned in the Queen's palace with my mother,"
I was fearful that I would lose her.
"I pretended to be calm and comforted my mother, ... but I knew."
I knew that I wouldn't be able to protect her in the end.
"I knew I would lose her, because I was too young and powerless."
I was desperate to protect her.
But now...
I'll be leaving as soon as he gets better.
It might be a burden to you and the young prince if I stay in the palace.
What burden?
His Majesty is very happy to see you.
I took away too much time as you already have a weary heart.
His body was blue all over...this mean that  there must be someone who's harming him purposely.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
What do you mean by harming His Majesty?
Be careful what you say.
Please calm down and let's hear what the doctor has to say.
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
He's been weak from the tumor and is not eating enough...
Are you sure that there isn't something wrong with his food?
"If there is a problem with the food, we need  to investigate the royal chef and find out the truth."
That's right.
We should...
You are wrong.
It won't be too late to investigate  after His Majesty gains back some energy.
What are you talking about?
We need to find out  the truth in order to prescribe the right treatment to him.
"Your Highness, he is extremely ill so please come back at a later time."
What do you mean?
I'm his mother.
Move a side.
Your Highness!
What's your intention for preventing me from seeing him?
I need to see his condition with my own eyes.
Please tell the Queen Mother that His Majesty  is not in a condition to see her right now.
Are you saying that I am harming him now?
I'm really looking forward to how the MV turns out.
Anyway we're done in the U.S.

Hello
Hello everybody
Hello at the top
Do you remember years ago when they were making Braveheart?
"Everyone said, ""Oh it's ridiculous, Mel Gibson playing a Scottish guy; that's not going to be very convincing."""
Look at him now.
An alcoholic racist.
The most Scottish thing I've ever seen.
"I was going through a town called Bathgate at night. and there was a guy pissing against a front door,"
like that.
He then took out his keys and went inside.
I'm from Glasgow.
"If I had to explain Glasgow to you, I'd say that if I had to pick a city in the world where I could depend on a member of the public to punch a man who was on fire."
To punch a flaming man to the ground.
We should get a photo of that blown up. and use it as the welcome sign at Scottish airports.
"Underneath, we should have the words, ""Scotland welcomes careful drivers."""
I mean the naivety of Al Qaida trying to bring religious war to Glasgow.
We're four hundred years ahead of you guys.
You've not even got a football team.
"There's a fallacy, isn't there, that that baggage handler prevented hundreds of people from being horribly burnt."
These were Scottish people flying to Spain.
People say its good that they didn't hit a fuel depot.
I think it's good they didn't hit the queue coming out of the duty free.
It would have gone up like Hiroshima.
British army have got a big recruitment driving on in Scotland at the minute.
Because that's what you need when you're fighting an unwinnable war in the desert.
"And besides that,"
Gary's Mattresses are probably filled and stuffed with dead minorities.

"-All right, so this video's old."
It's been floating around the Internet for about two years.
It's got about 2 million views and I don't know if it's real or not.
"I mean, look at that."
Terrorist Gary?
"""I'm a suicide bomber and I'm so offended."""
"But see, the address they give for the store doesn't check out on Google Maps."
"Also, the guy in it looks like a stand-up comedian that I've seen on TV."
Which makes me think the video is fake.
It also obvious seems a little too f--ked to have appeared on TV.
"-If you find a mattress at a better price,"
I'll kick a puppy and punch a kitten just for you!
"-All right, I've made up my mind."

"That's it, I'm out."
I'm gonna go have a beer.

"""Blanksy's Beauties."""
No?
I've never even heard of that show.
"""Blanksy's Beauties"" aired only three months in 1977, and she was just 11."
Today she works as an administrator at a religious school.
"Her job history, as unsettled as her life."
She says she was 12 when she realized she had begun to live two lives at once-- the present and the past.
"Her mother, Roz."
She was not easy.
"And that's because everything that was going through her head, she couldn't explain."
"Her brother, Mike."
"There were things I would think to myself, why don't you just get over that."
She doesn't.
It was hard for them because they didn't really know what to do for me.
My brother is totally opposite of me.
"I'm screaming, and yelling, and crying, and they didn't really know what to do for me."
You can see the toll it seems to have taken on her year-by-year.
"This profound lesson she teaches about our memories, our lives."
"Is it possible our happiness and survival come from what we choose to edit, to forget?"
Because you said at one point that we have no idea how much of ourselves is created by editing our memories to shape ourselves.
Right.
And I don't do that.
"Like, I still feel bad about stuff that happened 30 years ago."
But we all do.
We can all remember one or two things.
But not one or two things.
Everything.
And I really live it and feel it.
"And I think, God, if I just done this, then I wouldn't have done this, and I wouldn't be here, and I'm always constantly doing that."
"Her father, Len, a Hollywood agent, looks back."
Most of us are like that oyster that has that little grain of sand.
"Granted it's not something that a normal person should do, and it is dangerous, but you have that awesome rush that  you get to brag to your friends afterwards."
Even if they don't get it.
When people lie and then you learn  about the facts of a story there's also change.
Like the 5 guys everybody believed  raped a girl at Hofstra University.
Oooh the hate they got.
A buncha black guys raped a girl.
Time to go crazy.
I think it's Crazy O'Clock.
"Oh shit, it is."
Then you find out that the girl was lying.
That it was consensual.
And this was from her lawyers mouth.
"Her statement also coincided with a video that was taken of the incident, that showed it was definitely consensual."
I know what you're thinking.
"""I can't believe the girl that was willing to have sex with 5 guys at the same time would lie."
"My world is upside down."""
But congratulations to that girl  because she is definitely our
"Douchebag of the Day for announcing to the world that she was gangbanged by 5 guys in a bathroom by saying that they raped her and later sayings,"
"""Whoops, I lied about it."
"It was just a gangbang."""
Kudos.
"There's also my favorite form of change, which is Photoshop."
"Or as I like to call it, lying."
And we're gonna talk about Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Because Jennifer Love Hewitt had  some photos taken of her and a lot of people were saying that she was fat.
"She went off, ""I'm not fat!"
I'm beautiful.
You don't have to be impossibly skinny.
"Be happy with who you are."""
Which I think is a great message for women.
"On the cover of the new Shape Magazine,  she is Photoshopped."
Oh the hypocrisy gets me so hard.
"An image I quite like is that of being a Trojan mule, if you excuse my metaphor."
"What we are trying to do, is to get into schools, universities anyhow."
"Then the process does the work, really."
But I'll just finish with the story about how off-putting mindfulness can be to some people.
"I have a lovely colleague, very eminent professors of University of Exeter, called Willem Kuyken."
His daughter said to him after he  came back after one of these dos saying how well it went.
"She said, ""You do know dad,  that mindfulness is for losers."""
(Laughter)
"He said, ""Okay, you are sure about that?"""
"She said, ""Yup."""
Then she phone him later.
"She said, "" I just want to clarify that a bit."""
"He thought, ""She is going to say, 'I don't really mean it, dad'""."
"She said:""I just want you to know that it is not just me that thinks that."""
(Laughter)
And this is a girl's experience  in home and so on.
"She is a teenager, anything her parents  do is automatically awful."
"It is important really to start where people are, and to make sure that we do this in ways that appeal to people and don't just gratify our own egos."
"Okay, thank you for your time."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Katherine."

He has a long career working with young people in leadership development in a variety of different kinds of settings.
"We'll hear more about what  he is doing, from John."
"(John Bell) Dear Thay, dear friends, let's see who is in the room first."
How many here are classroom teachers?
Please raise your hand.
"Wow, just take a look around."
Wave to each other.
(Laughter)
How many here are school leaders or school administrators?
It's obvious you're doing well.
It looks good on you!
"Come on, enjoy your meal...- hey. dude..."
Didn't you find any other place to take the girl for a walk?
Your head doesn't work at all!
Don't let your friend wait for you.
Enjoy...&amp;gt; Thanks.
May God never let you lose your appetite!
If you want we can leave right away.
"We will leave after you're done with your meal.- If it's for me, I am sated."
I did a cheekiness.
"When it gets colder it has no taste, come on!"
Did you really give rein for 500000 USD to Faruk?
I gave it from my personal account.
Only fools do unrequited favors.
"I didn't grant that money to Faruk, dad!"
"Cut it out, for God's sake!"
I was married four times... and I didn't give reins to so much money for anyone.
I didn't lend anyone money without getting the return until today!
Neither in my personal life nor in my business life.
"Because I know that everything which belongs to me, belongs to you, to your brother, to my grandchildren and to this holding at the same time."
I don't ever forget this either.-But you don't behave like that
You take steps which you can't take them back.
"Dad, please!"
"Really, I don't have energy to discuss with you."
I have been running here and there all day.
Please could you let me unbrace myself a bit...
Don't test my patience Ender!
"I can tolerate you to feed ""street dogs"" at your home.. but nothing else except your family is yours."
Don't ever forget this!
Call Haldun right away!
"Let him investigate about all Faruk personal possessions.. and put on my desk.-as you wish ,sir."
"If my father did all this, why would he try so hard to bring.. ..you out of the jail?"
Do you know you would have been in jail.. .. for up to five years if he does not helped you.
Why would he do that if he wants to separate us?
Because they want that you should find fault in me.
Forget about all others.
Do you believe that I am the culprit?
Let us leave that matter now.
"Shailu, Do you believe that I am the culprit?"
What can I do but believe.
To get a job so quickly you may.
It is useless to convince you.
You began to believe.. ..your father blindly.
That is why you could not even .. ..believe me.
You dont love me any more.
I cannot be with you if you dont love me.
It is not proper for you to go to Vizag for such a small reason.
Small arguments are common among couples or lovers.
It may look like a small incident for you.. .. but it is very big concern for me.
Then also how can you break a relation?
You should convince her later when she is calm.
Convince her?
Is she a small girl?
Doesnt she have any brain?
You are behaving arrogantly.
I need not beg her.
She will come to me if she wants me.
Why are you worried so much baby?
It is just a small argument.
Is it not your fault that you raised an argument with him.. ..when he was surrounded by many tensions?
You know quarrels will increase if you let them to.. ..otherwise they will simply vanish.
After all the hard work I have done to separate them.. ..this old lady is trying to take away my fruits of success.
What are you still thinking?
Yep.
And trying to gain some control on showing all that different science.
In all those different categories?
In an easy way and getting all the.
"And, you work, you work in Academia, you work in Academia uh, (that) are getting all those reports and stuff and (do)."
I think everybody's doing our thing.
Absolutely yeah.
"It's hard, it's hard for."
The publications group said well we've already set our money on doing this.
But it's terrible.
"That's uh, ."
"The, for the interface, they contracted out."
"Or, um iii...."
"Which they did on their own. , Yeah, they would have been better doing it on their own."
"And, so, the desired for a straight test is very simple in nature to do."
They do a lot of stuff at
"PBS, of course, because of their, um."
"Sure, exporting it out quick would either faxing back."
Uh-huh.
"But they should, but they should make it so there's a choice so people could have a responsive design and be able to read those things very quickly."
Yeah.
"Um, so I, so I do our newsletter so and the spell check, so. , people are just going to scale down hopefully, on the phone and stuff like that, but we still need to rethink the whole ,, ."
"I don't know if you could share this information, but do you have any idea how many people your newsletter goes out to?"
"Um, I think we have, uh, 1,300, I think."
"Okay. ,, ."
"Just curious, um."
"So this, you're bringing up an int..."
"We've only had a newspaper, newsletter for so, so long, so..."
Yeah.
You're bringing up an interesting course idea for me.
"Which is, um."
Taking an existing website and going through a redesign to become more responsive.
Because you don't know poverty - Whatever it is!
"My dad can go to bankruptcy, we can go down to Zero... we will rearrange our life according to that."
"What are those mom, what are those, what?"
"You mean the real, true happiness is this, those things?"
"My sweetheart, are we not a family?"
How fast have you given up ?
"You will see,"
That man will be ashamed for what he did...
And also for attacking my dad in front of everyone ..
He will apologize to dad in front of everyone...
"I am saying it again, I trust my dad."
We have to support him.
After all this I don't even care what people say.
And i know my father is not a thief.
I know that he never wanted to do something bad.
We will pull ourselves together.
"You also pull yourself together, please.."
Are you alright?
I am worried about you.
(and he deletes it).
"And that Orkuc is an orkuc (blurt out) really. he wanders around with Hale, but I can't believe what Eylul did, how can one abandon the friend and go to them?"
"Instead of consoling Mira, both of them ran away..."
"I thought that ""plastic"" was next to Mira, he also went to Hale?"
"It looks like your receiver broke down, I am telling you since one hour."
"I am saying I saw him, I am saying she was in the car, I am saying he was with Hale."
"She needed moral support, by finding and putting her head on a pillow like this..."
"Okay, don't brisk up (simulate),i got it."
"I can understand all of them, but never Eylul."
"I will take one too, my head is exploding too."
"This night after talking to you, i did not get a wink of sleep."
I was so sad.
Who knows what they are talking about us?
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And we'll count about 50 to 100 of them, and we'll place them in a glass tube..."
And then we add some hexane.
And then we grind it up.
"And what you can see is the white part here at the bottom is the pulp of the seed, and that's where the oil is."
And what that oil will do is actually migrate up into the extraction layer here.
"And then will suck that little clear part off, and place it into a GC vile."
"Now once the liquid in in here, we have a computer that can control this robot"
And it applies a sample on every 24 minutes.
"Because this is automated, we can run anywhere from 900 to 1,000 samples within a week, and runs 24 hours a day."
Beth Seaton:
"Why would you run 900 to 1,000 samples?"
Win Phippen:
"Well, if you're breeding plants, you're not quite sure which one has the components that you want."
"So when I make a cross, I've got all the these young seedling plants, and I'm not sure which one I'm interested in."
So I have to collect seeds from each individual plant.
Beth Seaton:
Every single plant?
Win Phippen:
Every single plant.
Beth Seaton:
And that's why you keep these numbers running?
Win Phippen:
And I've got to keep every single vile together.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Once we have the sample in the vile, there's a robot here that is controlled by the computer, that will inject a sample very 24 minutes."
"So, as soon as the sample goes in, it actually enters into a very long glass tube."
It's about 30 meters long.
And so if it's a very
"And by the way, if you come over here to your MATLAB code and say, what's, what's"
A?
Notice how A is saved.
"The one wants components one, two, two is one."
"It only saves what it needs to, Okay?"
"So normally when you say A it , prints out this giant matrix to your screen."
"And it's just saying look, here are the components that are nonzero Yeah."
"I want to add like 68 equals twelve, do you blow the sparseness, or [inaudible] can you say A bracket, six comma A equals twelve, do you then add that point?"
And it's still sparse?
"Yeah, yeah, you can do this, check this out, yeah."
"A six comma twelve is equal to seven, because we like seven right?"
Huh?
"It's the best number ever, and we can just say spy that and check it out."
There's Taylor's number right over there.
It's a seven.
Still sparks.
You can do anything you want now.
Okay.
We're going to keep that there.
"And then by the way, I can put down diagonals anywhere I want now."
Let's put down another row of 1's at one.
Look at that.
I put it one diagonal over.
"As I said go to one, which is the next one over."
Put down ones.
Now our matrix is a little more complicated.
"I encourage you to look at page, whatever in the notes, where I actually show you what this thing looks like.'Kay?"
"And, this thing has a complicated structure, in particular, I guess we could Actually, I have it in my notes, so let m, e let me, let me draw this what this thing looks like."
"Do we have, turn the lights up here real quick?"
And then Alright.
So let me just show you what this thing
looks like.
"I think because now, because even connected to the web uh, I do multimedia for my work too."
So if I created something in there.
There's gotta be finally in the end exported as a.
Multimedia page.
Right.
On there.
Connecting that.
Yeah.
"You know, it would be a lot of free, free videos."
And I've searched for educational page on energy so I have some fun ones that I'd really I ike to put together for kids stuff.
"And, um, there's a lot of, you know, do it, uh, to be able to watch a video and have it actually."
"Get it all together. , out there."
Yeah that's a great idea.
Okay.
"And would you, um, would you find project type courses, maybe past the beginner stage, um, helpful, where you could practice your skills in a certain, um, in a certain environment or piece of software?"
I think...
"Um, I don't usually do the downloads."
"I, I only have a subscription just to watch the videos.'Cause I really never, have never had the time to be able to do one of those full class ones."
"Uh-huh. , The files to work with ."
"Um, I don't, I just don't have that kind of time to be able to use those true detailed trainings."
Sure.
"Um, I mean, if I did I probably would have signed up for that but I only did the one with the crash course videos."
Just the three videos.
That's my subscription on the space there.
"Um, yeah, even with the subscription that you have you still, uh, you can watch all of the different videos."
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Um.
"Yeah, we're just um."
We feel that.
"What we're looking at is expanding from a, uh, a more beginner and foundational level of knowledge."
And how do we start to take deeper dives now?
"You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you are gonna give me a ride home?"
"And I realized I should be the one to take that hit, not Carla"
"Hey, Lindsay, don't worry, he is not allowed to talk"
Is that true
You may nod*
"You know, when I was 15, I cut my own bangs**"
"Oh that's right, Percival, it's a highschool hair story"
"Anyway, Judy Keenan told me that she would also cut her hair off, it was like a suicide pact, only with bangs"
"I cut off my hair, and of course, she backed out, but even though my bangs looked horrible"
"I kept them that way, mostly because those stupid bangs were the only thing in my life that I felt I had control over"
"I'm so tired of everyone telling me what to do, when to be home##, what to wear, when to take my medication"
"I mean, I'm the one who's sick, right."
I can handle my own life
"How about if I tell your parents from now on, prescriptions for your medicine will be given directly to you, you'll be in charge of getting your Dilantin taking it."
Thank you.
Great
"I don't have a ring, but you can kiss my ass"
Feared in grey?
Beautiful in blue?
Feared in grey?
Beautiful in blue?
"I'm gonna grab a fry, some ketchup."
"Ah, it's cold"
This is
I'm back
That was weird
"No, that was weird"
What were you doing
"That's all it was, and if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself"
You're absolutely right.
It's my fault you kissed my wife.
"Oh man, I'm going home"
So let's say that that is the x-axis.
"Actually, I drew this-- let me edit, undo."
OK.
So let me draw the x-axis.
You might realize pretty soon why I have to redo this.
"The y-axis. x, y."
All right.
So we know that a and c are negative.
"So c is the y-intercept, right?"
"When x is equal to 0, we're just left with g of x is equal to c."
So c is the y-intercept.
"So if c is less than 0, we know that the y-intercept is going to be below the x-axis."
It's going to be a negative number.
We know that this is c.
That's where the graph intersects the y-axis.
We also know it's going to be symmetric around the y-axis.
"Well, actually, we don't know for sure that it's going to be symmetrical around the y-axis."
"And I could go into that in more detail, but I won't."
But that's all we need to know.
It depends what the bx-- this term-- is.
But let's just ignore that for now.
And then we know that a is negative.
"So in general, you might want to prove it to yourself, you know the graph of y equals x squared."
That opens up like this.
And the graph of y is equal to minus x squared.
It goes down like that.
So a possible graph for this would look like this.
The important thing is these are the two things that you know when they tell you a and c is negative.
"It's going to be a graph that opens downwards, and it's going to intersect the y-axis in the negative area, below the x-axis."
A legitimate graph also would have looked like this.
It could have also looked like this.
It didn't actually have to be symmetric.
We are in charge of His Majesty's wellbeing as well  as maintaining the palace traditions and rules.
We are the hidden hands that allow the palace to function smoothly.
Everything we do is for His Majesty and the palace.
All of you need to remember and remind yourselves of this.
Yes sir.
"Since the King is new on the throne, all eunuchs  are to be on standby without any shift changes."
If you stay here His Majesty will be in danger.
Don't move a muscle.
"I said, don't move!"
Who is that person?
He came with a recommendation from Yoon-jungho Minister.
Yoon-jungho Minister ... hmm.
He is the future of the palace inner power.
What do you mean?
"Since you became the Head of Eunuchs, you have become sneaky."
As for you...you may be a rat sitting on top of rice pot  but you never know when your luck will run out.
"If you want to stay there for long time, you need  to learn to tame young ones like him."
"Worrying about your food bowl, you must be getting old as well."
What would be more important than one's food bowl?
"You know, I almost got beheaded this time."
"I trust you, so please take care of me in the future as well ... hmm?"
"Your Majesty, please lay to the left of the queen."
"Your Majesty, raise your left side  so that your heart will be higher."
"First, kiss the lower lip and suckle it."
Then you must swallow her saliva.
"Place your hand on her lower stomach, then start caressing her."
Continue until her breast enlarges...
Then cover her breast with one hand; cover it completely.
"Your Majesty, you may start your movement."
"The Queen must embrace His Majesty's waist,  then accept his penetration."
"Your Majesty, I am ready, so go ahead."
You may feel the pleasure building.
And they're like pissed.
"Well, as pissed as a news anchor can be."
"-Boy, that interview on osteoporosis on Good Morning America sounded a lot better now than it did a few minutes ago."
[laughter]
-I'm like an angry troll.
-Don't be trolling girl.
So naturally my question is: so you missed the bridge falling; you can't rewind the tape and watch it?
"I mean, you're a news center."
Do don't have that kind of technology?
Or you couldn't do a split-screen?
Even I can do a split-screen.
"Hell, I can do a triple screen with the troll."
"""Triple screens are gay and so is your face... yo."""
"I don't know, I don't want to rip on him"
'cause I don't know how news stations work.
"But anyway, back to my original point."
"This video's funny, but why 8 million views?"
I don't get it.
"Maybe if they took her and crammed her into a dryer or if they took him and rammed his head into a fire extinguisher, then it would get 8 million views and we would all go"
"""Yeah, I get it."""
"Not that I recommend ramming a news anchor's head into a fire extinguisher,"
I'm just sayin'.
"If such a thing did happen, the video might go viral."
But you know what else you should cram into a dryer?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bing!, and she said..."
"-If you were to have your own holiday, what would it be called?"
-So invent a holiday.
What's your holiday?

I knew there had to be something wrong with her.
She's still perfect

I don;t think it's funny
How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
I'm not hiding.
I don't really want to be bald. .
I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me.
It think it might accentuate my spoon chest*.
Plus the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair
She gotta be interested in more than just your hair
"If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you."

Ladies and gentlemen...
At last we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din but with one fat ball the Yanks stove us in.
Goddamn them all!

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Barrett was smashed

Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
So here I lay in my twenty-third year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been six years since we sailed away and I just made Halifax yesterday.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears.

This one's my project.
"I'll find a way, don't worry."
And...
I love people who keep secrets... who are silent until his death or be silenced by death!
You have a sister named Nurten!...
Ayten-Nurten ..
"She goes to high school, she's a very beautiful young woman..."
It is good to be careful because you never know that samething bad could happen but...
I'm sure you'll be protected!
yeah... but is Nedždet there?
I do not know.
"Is everything all right, young man?"
I'm looking for Necdet.
Me too. but he is not here.
ok
"My daughter, it was a lower class, but I wanted to set it to a higher level to fit accommodation in our society."
"For your sake, I chose not to respect your love for him."
I said to myself I will accept it for Feridie well to see a smile on your pretty face.
"But there have been other things, and the man was lying in the face manipulated you..."
"Now tell me, dear Feride will you accept the man who cheated and lied to you?"
"Maybe you're still confused that's why you went to see him in the hospital, but do not do it anymore, Feride.,"
You're not like that you are a person with dignity and pride even if it was love.
Can a person put their pride and dignity to a compromise?
This man does not deserve all your pain.
All these tears like that from you flowing drop by drop.
Is that what is broken.
"Him I can not never forgive, never!"
"Listen Feride, whatever is done I can not live without you, but please do not use this paternal feelings."
Whatever happened left behind in the past bury love and feelings in the heartand considers them dead.

"There are so many different countries, I don't know, where should I go?"
He said Italy?
"Never go there, it's no good."
The Italians are as false as the Chinese.
"Everything depends on sympathy, if you sing well or not doesn't count."
The teacher sais about France:
"France is super, everybody wants to go there."
"Paris is an excellent city, but when your no genius, you don't have a chance to get in there."
Then he gave me a good advice:
Germany is the best.
Why is Germany so good?
In Germany there are theatres everywhere.
Also in the small towns.
Therefore you build your career from place to place with endurance and passion.
In the end you can stand on the big stage in Bayreuth.
"And in Germany, the teacher said, there is an important difference:"
In Germany the north is more liberal than the south.
Therefore I wanted to go to Berlin.
I then asked everybody who is concerned with Somalia for advice.
"Wolrd Hunger Aid, journalists in Africa, UN, foreign ministry, everyone said the same: don't go there, it's too dangerous."
"But then I found out, that noone I spoke with was in Somalia in the last years."
Everything I found out was only hearsay.
"Entrance examination in Berlin, the next is Bee Chang from Taiwan, with an aria by Rossini:"
Semiramide.
Semiramide by Rossini.
This is really very beautiful.
Wonderful.
But I think you really can't sing Rossini this way.
"This was the sentence that the professors in Berlin said to Bee, when they rejected her."
This european way of singing turned into a legend for Bee.
She later sang a concert in a church in Germany and found out: there's also something about the architecture.
My voice sounded just as the voices on the european CDs that I was always listening to in Taiwan.
100 billion 68 thousand miles.
"2.6 trillion, two-thirds of the way to the moon."
Spendin g that every year on your health care.
Just an outstanding amount of money and here's my last comparison.
"If you look at our health care spending in the context of the world GDPs, France is the fifth largest GDP in the world after the United States, China, Japan, Germany,"
"France, okay?"
They've got 66 million people.
This is their spending on everything.
"Vacations, education, the good French food, housing."
"Defense, cars."
They spend roughly what we spend at everything for 66 million people what we spent for 300 million people just on healthcare.
"In other words, if the US Healthcare System, with world economy, it's the fifth largest economy in the world, the sixth largest world economy."
Just an amazing amount.
If you look at China.
You know we're spending about 40 percent of the Chinese GDP.
Just on health care.
We're worried about them taking us over.
"You know, we should be worried about our healthcare system."
"Now, it's not just the level we need to worry about."
That's very high but if it weren't moving.
We can handle it.
It's also how fast it's growing.
"So, get your audience response clickers out."
"If health care inflation continues at the current rate which is the rate that's been going for about 30 years, when will one-third of the"
"GDP, that's one out of $three in your wallet go to health care?"
"We need music, we got to do the music."
The answer is.
Twenty to 30 or you guys are even more pessimistic than reality.
Alright.
"It's twenty, 40 round about."
"It's actually twenty, 37 and it obviously depends upon healthcare inflation but that's an outstanding number."
One of every $three.
So in the end I didn't get written up again.
Another letter from whoever it was that charges these spy planes crew get another letter from them thanking us for the job done.
And then I get promoted.
The average staff sergeant made it in somewhere between 7 and 9 years and I made it a little over 3.
"And every time I got in trouble, I got promoted."
"Because, we did stuff."
It was a special request mission and you broke the regulations but helped out...
"Yeah, well, we had to do it."
Because it was our job.
Our line pilots.
We didn't have any trouble with our
line pilots.
"These guys are up to 30, 32 years old."
"You get in to maybe a colonel or something, he's"
looking at the back a little bit.
The other guy - you wanted to load up didn't care what you were loading.
"Now load it, they'd fly it."
That was it.
"Now, did you ever speculate on what was in that trailer?"
No.
"Just electronic gear, I'm sure."
Because they were still flying the U-2s.
He'd been shot down already but they were still flying
U-2s and the RB-57s.
There was a B-57 they converted to - Now you see these big 747 jet engines.
At the time - a 707 engine was yay big.
They had those engines that were bigger than that window on the U-2 and on these RB-57s - reconnaissance.
That they had converted to fly reconnaissance missions.
And an RB-57 will do almost as high as a U-2.
They'd take off from there and they'd have to fly
South from Pakistan.
"To get up to 70,000 feet or so, and then turn over to Russia, and land over in Sweden, you know, taking pictures on the way."
That is the total number of ways that you can set the
Enigma machine.
This would be an army Enigma machine around about 1939.
-You are telling me that the Germans would send each other messages like Numberphile or send--
DR. JAMES GRlME:
"Yeah, they did that all the time."
-Or send the U-boat to this position or whatever.
But how were they telling each other their plug settings and their starting rotor numbers?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
So this is very important.
"So these two people, who are miles apart, need to have the same setting."
"Now, the setting was written down for you on a piece of paper."
What they would have is a sheet of paper like that.
And it would be a big sheet of paper for each day of the month.
So it was a monthly sheet.
"For each day of the month, they told you how to set the machine for that day."
"If you didn't have this sheet of paper, you wouldn't know what the setting was that you had to use for that day."
"And nice, little story, the Navy would write these code books in soluble ink."
"So if you get sunk, if you get caught, if you throw the code book into water, that's how you keep the secret."
"-It sounds to me that all you need is an Enigma machine and a copy of that book, and you know everything they're saying."
DR. JAMES GRlME:
You would do.
"So if you had the machine and you had that code sheet, you would be able to decode all the messages."
Fantastic.
Great.
But we had the machine.
"And once we've had the machine, we can pull it apart and find out how it works."
Great.
But it was getting those code sheets.
That was difficult.
They were monthly.
They would change every month.
What is the planting date? planting density? planting methods? the pollination systems?
What roles to bees play in pollinating this particular crop?
"We'll look at what is the impact of pennycress on soybeans, which is a crop that would follow pennycress."
And we'll have a chance to take a look at all of that tomorrow.
We'll offer coffee and doughnuts.
Beth Seaton:
Great!
Win Phippen:
And it starts at 10 a.m. and finishes at noon.
Rain or shine.
Beth Seaton:
"Are your students going to be out here, helping you tomorrow?"
Win Phippen:
The sure will.
"The students, they play a big role in trying to do these research plots."
"They learn how to develop a plant-breeding program, and develop a crop from essentially a weed."
Beth Seaton:
Who is invited to Field Day tomorrow?
Win Phippen:
The intent is really to introduce pennycress to the general public.
"Now, we've invited fellow researchers over from Peoria, who have been working on the crop. and industry folks, who have a vested interest in pennycress in the bio-fuels area."
"They'll be over to talk about what they're up to, in terms of building a bio-diesel plant."
"And local growers, who have had to chance, sort of, play with it, nd they'll give us some feedback on how well it went and some of the challenges they are facing in growing the crop."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, well, we'll be back tomorrow to look at your Field Day."
I hope the weather holds out for us.
Win Phippen:
It sure will.
Thank you.
Win Phippen:
"So we've got some growers and sales folks, and the local support, chemistry support from the USDA."
I'd like to being the day first by introducing Terry Isbell.
Stop!
"Do not come any closer, Young Miss."
I cannot reveal my identity due to reasons untold.
Then at least tell me your name.
"What is the use of revealing my name, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when we are like two leaves flying by in the wind?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let us just remember each other by our fragrances in the moonlight.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
But I don't smell anything.
Do not come any closer and ignite the explosives of love in my heart.
But I don't have any fire on me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The light in your eyes is enough to light any fire in a man's heart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Now that the fire has been put out, I will bid you farewell like the wafting smoke."
Are you telling me to be like fire and go out?
Alright then.
"I'll go. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell, Doe Eyes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
What did you just say?
I...
I mean...
Do you know me?
No.
"But didn't you just say, ""Farewell, Doe Eyes""? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;No, I said ""Farewell, Goggle Eyes""&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because you looked like you had bad eyesight."
So you may go.
"In any case, thank you."
I'll repay this favor in the future.
I am Heo Yi Nok.
I sell medicine in front of Merchant Wang's store.
"By the way, I have great eyesight!"
Don't worry about me!
"He hasn't seen her in a year, and yet he can't say what he wants to her."
Wait!
I have a request.
Forgive me for sending you away without showing you my face.
But I cannot reveal myself to you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But I know I will think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Please take care of yourself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm sorry for sending you away like this.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I will not be able to show myself to you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But even so, I will always think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I hope that you'll be safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Farewell, Young Miss."
"Well, here are her total reading scores."
"Last year in the seventh grade, she made a dramatic leap."
"Her comprehension score went from fourth grade, second month up to seventh grade, nearly a three year gain."
"What's very distinct in our community is a division between blacks and whites, right?"
"What, specifically, about the way that they speak?"
How does she feel about the way mama speaks?
"She feels embarrassed because, like, she's still using improper English."
She feels it's improper English.
Great.
What else?
What other issues about race have come up?
I definitely noticed a willingness in Sarah Lee to think beyond the first initial thought.
"She's starting to push herself beyond that, beyond cliches."
She compares how the schools-- the stamps are different from the schools.
She's highly intelligent and she's a good thinker.
She's capable of thinking through ideas.
But perhaps the best witness to Sarah Lee's progress is Sarah Lee herself.
Remember this moment from a year ago?
He used it in-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
I have matured a lot.
I have participated in my classes.
I've been behaving well.
I've been doing my homework.
My grades have been pulled up.
I've been working very hard.
"And, like, I've been overcoming the mistakes that I did many years ago."
It's clearly beginning to happen for her.
And I think this is going to be a wonderful year.
She's a wonderful girl.
And I think she will leave here and go to high school and college.
"And I hope that whatever her wishes are, they will be realized."
So far our journey through these young lives has been a difficult but mostly hopeful one.
"So, the kind of programming , the kind of programming that is going on."
And I'm asking you to just stay as only the awareness of it.
You're aware of that.
"And somehow in being aware that you're observing a kind of pattern, a kind of story, a kind of picturing."
"Because this is what actually happens quite often, is that there is a picture, you've a little youtube in your head, of somebody going , 'I'm having a baby'"
'being happy and it's like forever'.
Although it is only 10 minutes.
"It's kind of , you know.."
"You tube is only 10 minutes, but you can.."
"So, like this and something, the mind embellishes everything else."
It fills in.
This is how it is.
"You suggest something and the mind fills in all the other parts of it, like this."
"And so, it is the mind that is addicted to it's own projections."
And you've identified with the mind.
And so some of the stain feels like it is coming off on you.
That is the 'I' who want it.
"So, it's a bit entangled there, you see."
"So, I only say, that you're aware of this."
This activity of the mind or personality.
"It's creating these pictures, Ok?"
"So, just now, even now, you can do, that you're aware of what you've spoken also."
Something is aware of this.
There is an awareness of this.
That's the awareness of.
"But now I'm pointing you just to the awareness, without the 'of', something, you see."
In which anything can come.
Ok.
"Well, this story of wanting this, you know, shining prince or whatever, it comes and goes."
"It's not constant, continuously in your mind."
Is it?
No.
He made it sound as if the coffee pickers were his colleagues and the plantation owners were the company director's cousins.
Once we attended a lecture series.
"I heard Rolf Blomberg, Eric Lundqvist and other adventurers."
Sometimes I saw a human vertebra on the necklace.
It was a human Atlas vertebra.
They wouldn't have a chance in a beauty contest.
They buy their pigs and their wives...
Sten Bergman from New Guinea...
He was a bit of a comedian.
He showed a film where he put up an axe on a greased pole.
The natives had to try to take it down.
Dad was so upset that we left in the middle of the lecture.
It was so condescending.
Of course people wanted a good axe.
They shouldn't have to do circus tricks for it.
That attitude affected me a lot.
Dad identified more with the natives than with the explorers and the company head.
Summer home in SkŒne
Tiny fishing villages where people are poorest and lead hard lives are the prettiest to us.

Do you see Sweden in the same way as you see other countries?
Sweden is an integrated part of the world.
"We have a tendency to see Sweden... ...as more ""permanent"" than it is."
"We speak of ""Swedish values""."
When I was in the student union in 1969-1970 we handled a secret fund where women could borrow money to go to Poland and get an abortion.
We didn't have abortion in Sweden in 1970.
Female students in Uppsala borrowed money from us.
Then they took the boat to Poland and got abortions.
That was Sweden in 1970.
Sweden legalized abortion a year after India.
Now we think it's a modern part of Swedish society.
Unfortunately there are no such churches in Taiwan.
And then Bee went to Hamburg.
To the musical.
"When we planned our journey to Somalia, the media reported about a humanitarian catastrophe."
Back then 20 000 people starved to death.
Half a million Somalis fled to Kenia from the draught.
And I saw a photo in a newspaper report.
"There is a small child on the ground in a bent position, about 4 years old, naked."
"Next to it, there is a vulture, waiting for the child to die."
The photographer waited 20 minutes for the vulture to spread its wings.
I would like to stage a play in the National Theatre of Somalia.
It should be like this.
"So good, that the whole audience would be so enthusiastic, that suddenly there would be peace in the whole country."
Then I made one more attempt.
On the rehearsal stage I focused all the lightning on one place.
I lay down there.
"I wanted to see, how long it takes that I get really thursty, and how long I could endure it."
I made a performance as well.
I wanted to feel the earthquake of tsunami 2005 in my body.
I fell to the floor.
I slipped over the stage with tap-dance-shoes.
There were ugly scratches on the stage and it sounded ugly.
And then much more text.
Bee is still in Hamburg at the musical.
I went to drink some water first and turned on the radio.
In the National Theatre in Mogadishu a suicide-bomber blew herself up at an anniversary.
"Mogadishu doesn't need beautiful arts, but hard life."
"At the musical I realised, that the over-optimistic entertainment style doesn't fit my mentality."
Ladies and gentleman:
Bee Chang from Taiwan!
[musical song]
"Then I took of my costume, and looked exotic enough for a part in Lion King."
"Okay as usual, are there any questions or comments about the talk this evening on emotions?"
"Yeah, okay."
Man 1: ...[difficult to hear]
"(if we point one finger at someone, three point back at us)..."
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yeah, you're talking about that one."
That's the old story.
"See three, you don't know what the thumb is doing, but one's pointed that way."
Man 1:
[difficult to hear]
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yes that's right, so if you criticise somebody else.."
This was actually a saying of the Emperor Ashoka.
"Who was a Buddhist, was it it 200 years before the birth of...about 22 hundred years ago or something."
"And he wrote in stone, we know what he said because those stone monuments are still there."
"Usually in museums now, some are in their original place."
He said this wonderful thing that anybody who criticises another person's religion thereby criticises his own faith.
"That's a wonderful thing to say 22 hundred years ago, what a beautiful way of tolerance."
"You criticise somebody else's religion, then you're showing that your own faith is not really up to scratch."
It's not just religion - if you criticise somebody else then you're showing your own understanding of life is lacking.
How can you criticise others?
"How much do you know about them, why they did that?"
How many times have you been criticised - unfairly?
So why do you go criticising others?
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
And you have a happy life.
And there's much doubt to give people the benefit of.. [laughter]
Okay thank you for that Eddy.
"We've got a question there, and then over there, yes"
Man 2 [hard to hear]:
"Your Holiness, I was intrigued by your labelling of grief as a negative emotion."
The way I see it negative emotions are destructive.
Now where was she living and where were you living at the time?
Sal:
"She was based in New Orleans,which is where I grew up."
But I was in Boston at the time.
"And we agreed that she would go home, and we would get on a conference cal,l and we'd figure out something."
I used Yahoo Doodle to tutor her.
"And a couple months later, that worked out."
"Then I started tutoring her brothers, a couple other cousins."
"The whole time, I still had a day job."
"And about a year later, it just became hard for me to scale myself:"
I had trouble scheduling with all my different cousins and family friends and all the rest
And I had a buddy who I was talking to over dinner.
And I said:
"""You know, I'm really enjoying this tutoring thing that I'm doing after work."
"But it is getting difficult."""
"And he said ,""Why don't you just record your lectures and put them on YouTube?"""
"And I said; ""No, YouTube is for dogs on skateboards."
"It's not for serious mathematics, """
"But I tried it out, and, long story short:"
My cousins said that they liked me better on YouTube than in person.
"And other people did too, and they just kept watching it."
"So, it's about 2.5 million people a month are watching the videos."
Tom:
And you've got about 2200 videos.
Sal:
"It is now pushing 2800 videos, on everything from basic addition to vector calculus, and biology, and chemistry, and whatever else."
Tom:
Is this a commercial enterprise?
Are you doing this just to keep the country better informed?
Sal:
No.. a lot of my buddies from the very for-profit investment world are wondering what happened to Sal.
But I decided to make it a not-for-profit.
I'm going to do one more here.
I'm going to do one more.
"""Shakespeare in Love"" win seven Oscars."
"March 21, 1999."
"Well, I give up."
I told you.
You can't stump me.
I surrender.
I surrender.
"Jill Price told Diane Sawyer she decided to share her story because of the memory of seeing a confused woman in a bank, dressed in a bathrobe, clearly suffering from Alzheimer's."
"Jill thought, how can I have so many memories, while her's erode?"
"She hopes her new book, The Woman Who"

We'll be right back.
"If I ask you, apart from Violin do you know what other instrument can be played on the shoulder?"
That's Right!
Is a VlOLA~
If you have no idea what a viola is it actually doesn't matter....
"Since, most of the violists are used to it and not only viola but many other instruments or  music genres are being misunderstood or neglected."
That's why I am here making a mini series  about music knowledges that you may not know.
[ The E Symphony ]
The 1st episode of the E Symphony will be about the viola
The English name of the viola is viola.
(nice translation)
"Some people pronounce as ""viola"""
Viola with other string instruments are all evolved  from a Baroque instrument called the Viol
"You may have now notice that, compare to the violin, cello or double bass, you have less opportunity to hear the word ""viola"""
"But this is pretty normal, this already happened since long time ago"
The structure of early music is
The top part (treble) makes the melody.
The lowest part (bass) makes the basic harmony
"The light that emanates from consciousness, this is revealing the forms of the creation,  you see."
So that is also seen.
"So, the question:"
"Sri Ramana, he describes it as  self-effulgent."
Not relying  upon something else.
Not relying  upon something else.
"The moon, they say, has no light of its own."
I am told this;
I never could prove it.
"They say the moon  doesn't have a light of its own, that it is reflecting only  the light from the sun."
"This is what I'm told,  like that."
Okay?
The sun is not depending  on something else.
The moon is depending  on something; the moon is depending  on the sun's light in order to reflect  even this coolness that we enjoy.
"So, mind is like this moon and mind's light  is like this moonlight."
"It also can only reflect, also,"
"Hm? the energy that's coming  from the sun-self, it's like that."
And the light of the sun and the sun are one.
Harmony.
"Like the fragrance  of a flower and the flower, they are one, not two separate things."
They are like one.
"But the smell can come,  the flower can come."
"And this one is saying,"
'... that which is  self-effulgent.'
I don't think 'self effulgent' -
I'm not sure  about this term 'effulgent' - somebody can help me?
Effulgent means self-radiating?
Self-radiating.
"Then, if he speaks  about a light which is self-radiating, then it can only be  a metaphor for the Self, not the phenomenon  of light only."
"It must be  some metaphor for Self, because Self is beyond  light and darkness."
"In It,  light and darkness manifest, time and space manifest through  the mind and consciousness."
All of these can appear.
I Kiss you sir congratulations
We want them..
We want them
Ok calm down.. they'are coming.. ok they're coming
Ok they're coming..
Ok..Ok calm down they're coming now
Applaud..
Applaud.. here comes the great artist
Thank you very much
How did we do aunty.. they liked us and who does not love a woman like me you fill the whole stage.. of course they'll love you you fill it so much that they can't even see the Kanoon player
"- Kanoon player how are you? - fine.. fine since you're ok then let's start 1, 2, 3,4"
Go ahead
Thank you you're welcome
I'll have my coffee then leave why the rush?
I'll go home and look on the internet for a home to rent since you're looking for a house for rent it means you're staying in Istanbul
No ..
Not for this reason
I don't want to be a burden on Mrs. Nesrin it's not nice
And if you see any house suitable for me just tell me
Ok .. what are you looking for?
"Not very expensive, small, doesn't have any problems no noisy neighbors.. would be enough do you have a friend for me I can share the house with her in fact there is"
Where?
Very close to here
Do you know the owner?
Yes I know him very well but is there a proper house in this area
There is
"Ok, can we go tomorrow and see it together in fact in fact we don't need to go anywhere because the house I'm talking about is this one it has many rooms Jeren"
Why don't you stay here? you mean to live together here
You said you need a friend in the house
I wish for you to live a beautiful and happy life
God willing
Now you have a big responsibility
What's your business here?
Does your son know he's ill?
Does he know what's wrong with him?
How..
And so the the story begins
"City dweller, successful fella"
Thought to himself oops I've got a lot of money
I'm caught in a rat race terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the centuries anxiety
"Yes, it preys on him, he's getting thin"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
"Oh, it's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country"
"He's got morning glory, life's a different story"
"Everything's going jackanory, in touch with his own mortality"
"He's reading balzac, knocking back prozac"
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
"Oh, it's the centuries remedy"
"For the faint at heart, a new start"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest in the country
"He doesn't drink smoke laugh, takes herbal baths in the country"
Says she's come to no harm on an animal farm in the country
"In the country, in the country"
In the country
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"He lives in a house,  a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats  and the food he eats in the country
"No soy, no rice."
It's made actually out of tapioca and arrowroot flour.
"I know that's not making your mouth water, but man, it is good."
Here is another example of where you can get your protein from.
This is a vegan sausage.
"It's about that big, the size of this remote."
There is 4 in a package.
Each one of these has 29 grams of protein.
"Again, the healthiest food you can eat is whole foods."
I don't mean the supermarket.
"I mean the fruits, the vegetables, the rice, the beans, stuff that's fresh."
That is not processed.
And the last thing I want to show you is another video.
It is a happier video.
And this is the whole idea of change in perception.
"I know I am keeping you here, longer than you probably wanted."
But this is a really beautiful story.
And I hope you enjoy it.
"On the night of September 18, 2007 a cow was spotted on the streets of Queens."
"She was tagged for slaughter, but she escaped that fate and literally ran for her life."
Police and firefighters captured her and brought her to Animal Care &amp;amp; Control in Manhattan.
"From there, Farm Sanctuary's rescue team stepped in."
Maxine's dash for freedom.
"There she is, beautiful girl."
"She was tagged for slaughter, and it would have been her fate."
But she wanted to live and so she really ran for her life. and now she'll live out her life in the Sanctuary.
It is interesting how the public responds when one individual animal makes a run for her life.
They end up making headlines on national news.
People's hearts goes out to this one individual animal.
The cruelty that happens to farm animals is largely hidden behind factory farm walls.
And people aren't aware of that.
"When you look in her eyes, everyone wants the best for her."
"And so, that's the exciting thing about pennycress."
It's a brand new crop.
"No one has actually done much research on this particular crop, and so the possibilities are endless on pennycress."
And it's exciting to have students involved in this type of project.
And the employment opportunities are tremendous.
You're starting to see a lot companies starting to talk about green energy and green production.
"And so these students are going to be positioned very well, in terms of getting positions at these companies,"
"looking at new crops, and breeding new varieties, and things like that."
Beth Seaton:
"It's really exciting that we have these opportunities for students here in Macomb, illinois."
And I really appreciate you showing me your lab and talking to me about your project.
Win Phippen:
That's great.
Anytime.
"You know what, later on this week, we're actually having a Field Day about pennycress."
"It will be out at the research farm, and it's opportunity for not only producers, but also, say, for potential students and other students to come out and see what we're doing out in the field."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, great!"
I would love to come out if you would be willing to show it to me.
Win Phippen:
I'd love to.
Make sure to bring your boots!
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, thanks."
Win Phippen:
It should be fun.
Win Phippen:
All right.
Thanks for coming out.
This is the field plots for the pennycress research.
We've got several studies out here.
"The one to the north here is a planting density and planting methods study, where we are trying to answer the question of how many seeds do we need to put in the ground to get a decent yield."
"A French invention, a well-known Ime brand."
"Of course it's a French invention, that is exactly what I want."
How much would you like
Let's say a bagful.
"Thank you, just a moment."
"Excuse me, before I sell you the French invisibility powder, I am obligated to ask you if you know how to use it."
I suppose you ingest it.
-That's correct!
That's not all.
Many people think that all you have to do is ingest the powder and everything will be ok.
"When taking the invisibility powder, or any other medicine, it is important to believe in it."
Do you believe -Of course.
Thank you.
"In that case, here's what you do."
Do you have the patience to listen.
"-Yes, mr apothecary"
"Do the following - ingest a pinch of invisibility powder, kick the big toe of your left foot with the heel of your right foot, and shout in your mind, through the walls!"
"In that instant, you'll be invisible."
You may also walk through walls if you feel like it.
But only in the clothes you're wearing.
"For example, if you turn invisible and steal teamster Ruuskas' hat and run away it is going to look like only the hat is running down the street."
Will I stay invisible then
"Don't worry, Mr Vinski, if you want to become visible again, you just have to do everything in the opposite order."
"Kich the big toe of your right foot with the heel of your left foot and shout in your mind, walls through!"
In that instant you'll go back to normal.
"Yes, I think I got it."
Thank you!
-It's quite simple really.
All great things are simple.
"Excuse me, considering that my shoelace came untied with all this climbing you won't mind if I tie it up."
Of course!
-Thank you!
They're all at about the same place.
And with these bubbles...
"This isn't a video, the bubbles represent figures from a database that draw this diagram."
But I can still pull everything around.
That's the genius of the program.
We can choose specific bubbles and I can go to 1964 and the hostilities between Vietnam and the United States.
If I eliminate the other countries we see only Vietnam and the US.
Al Gore grabbed me and said:
And that was Al Gore!
Then Google's founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page approached me.
They wanted to talk some more and invited Ola and Anna to Google.
Rosling 's son Ola and his wife Anna developed the animated graphics along with three others.
Now they all have jobs at Google.
Google also bought the software for millions.
The money became the basis of the non-profit Gapminder foundation.
Today eight people collect data on development and distribute it free.
For example on video.
How high do they have to be?
Can you adjust the camera?
There was a gender conference on Sunday.
"Then I flew to the US and talked in Portland and at Google's AGM, called Zeitgeist, in San Francisco."
Then I was home...
And then I talked at the world dentist convention.
Then I spoke at a gas conference in Holland...
Now everyone wants to hear the professor.
"Norwegian oil companies, pharmacists, the Swedish medical association the UN Economic and Social Council, Telenor's managers"
European web developers and Bill Gates...
On April 15 I'm going to Trinidad to lecture to foreign ministers and entrepreneurs in Latin America at their meeting on development.
Then I head for Washington for the World Philanthropy Forum.
"Headed by Bill Clinton, they donate money to global development."
"You meet a lot of people, but do you feel you influence development?"
"Yes, because people gain a greater understanding of statistics."
"Now, for the most important question:"
"Is Father Richard Moore guilty... ...beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?"
"Did he, in fact, neglect Emily's needs in such a way... ...that her death is now on his hands?"
No!
That is not a fact.
It is not a fact that Emily was epileptic.
It is not a fact that she was psychotic.
Facts... ...leave no room for possibilities.
The only fact... ...the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case... ...is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.
He did everything in his power to help her.
He has risked his very freedom so we could hear her story.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...in my job I sometimes have to defend bad men.
Father Richard Moore is not one of them.
Don't send a good man to prison.
I'm not asking that you believe everything that Father Moore believes.
I'm simply asking that you believe in Father Moore.
"Madam Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have, Your Honor."
Please read the verdict out loud.
"""In the case of *The People* *v. Father Richard Moore*... ...we, the jury, find the defendant... ...guilty of negligent homicide."""
The court thanks the jury for its service.
Sentencing for this case will be set for April 3rd.
"Your Honor, if it pleases the court... ...Father Moore requested at the start of trial... ...that if found guilty, he would be sentenced immediately."
"Yes, I recall that."
Does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
Very well.
"Father Richard Moore, do you understand this sentence... ...which has been found against you?"
"- Yes, Your Honor."
And do you understand the gravity of this crime?
"That you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?"
"Yes, I do."
Are there any statements you wish to make... ...before I impose this sentence?
(Laughter)
Anyway --
"When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Connecting route through the Andes.
Farewell Argentina.
San Fancisco Pass.
Did you enjoy the ride Harry?
- Yes.
"Through the Andes, did you like it?"
"- Yes, I really did."
Did anything exciting happen during the trip.
"- Yes, Steven did some stunts."
"Dust, dust and more dust."
What is your personal experience this Dakar?
- An enormous experience
"This is Steven, our reckless pilot."
He hits the gas peddle at the right moments.
Steven wants a hummer for the next Dakar.
We flew with the Dodge for a little while.
Alle the cargo is still on the truck.
"Only one fog light is broken, that's all."
and we arrived safely in the bivouac again
"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, the healthy vegan cooking show."
Iím Heather and tonight we are going to make some maple Dijon glazed carrots and parsnips.
This is something that I love to make as part of appetizers night.
Phil and I sometimes
like we were having a celebration to just do a whole dinner of appetizers but it is also be a nice side for other dish or whatever you like.
"So for those of you who have not seen parsnips before they look like a white carrot, they usually have a very fat end as suppose to carrots which are usually fairly uniform just getting skinnier at the tip."
So you wanna have the same amount of parsnips as carrots.
"It doesnít really matter how much youíre doing but anyway with carrots I donít peel them, I just trim off either end and give them a good scrub with a potato scrubber brush."
Three hundred and sixty three...
Yes.
[Laughter].
Ok.
"These belong to some equivalence class, and we'll give that a name."
We'll call that equivalence class one third.
Are you with me?
Ok?
"Now, once you have that, then of course you can talk about fractions, right?"
"And then everybody knows how to work with fractions, which are really disguised ways of dealing with the equivalence relation that is embedded here."
What's the equivalence relation?
Everybody learns in grade school.
When are two fractions equivalent?
"I'll have you think about that, but the set of all such classes will be called Q, which is basically the set of all such equivalence classes... of pairs... of these ordered pairs."
Right?
What ordered pairs?
The ordered pairs in Z cross Z. Ok?
"We might have to be a little careful here, maybe Z cross Z minus 0... the set containing 0... period."
Ok?
Ok.
Everybody with me?
What have we just one?
I've just defined what I mean by Q. Right?
"It's an ordered pair, and... it's equivalence classes of ordered pairs."
"Now, what we haven't said is what the equivalence relation is, so..."
What is the equivalence relation?
"By the way, before we even talk about what the equivalence relation is, what's another thing you might want to be true about Q?"
"Aside from the fact that, you know,"
"I've just said that there's a set here, but somehow... how's it related to the set that I began with?"
"I might want to delineate that, I might want to tell you how is it that Q is related to Z."
"And usually, the way you think about Q, is that it somehow extends Z, right?"
"You have a bunch of points, these are whole numbers on the number line that you grew up thinking about, and now we fill them in with a bunch of points in between, right?"
We will all die... all will die!
No!!
What do we do!?!!?
"Let's survive from this survive, so we all can fulfill our dreams"
let's lead this war to victory it's better if the one that's going to die anyways die right?
I will go!
Injured Jun officer volunteered to take the captain's place in the plan.
"The captain was unable to stop him, and with the words ""Please look after my son"", Jun ran to the enemies will it get better if I sleep?"
It is frightening to go to sleep
Endless darkness.
Dawn that never comes
Will it get better if I sleep?
It is frightening to sleep
Endless darkness.
Dawn that never comes
"With the death of Jun officer, the captain feels agony from the fact that wars require sacrifices"
Are you kidding?

Hi!
Today I am going to talk about how to create this effect; this infinite white background.
If you saw the Apple commercials;
"Odysseus sends back the message, not yet."
Let's wait until nighttime.
Very interesting exchange of messages there.
"They're, they're easy enough to take on the plain surface level and may well be that all that's happened is Penelope has said, yeah, sure I'd like to talk to this stranger."
I could find out about my husband.
"And this stranger says, well let's do it later on."
It's more convenient for me.
"But, there's something also, the, the, the forwardness of Penelope may, asking to make an audience with this stranger whose nothing but a beggar."
"And then the stranger coming back and saying, rather than just sort of dropping everything and saying, oh my gosh the lady of the house is willing to speak with me."
"But rather, saying, hold off, wait."
"Let's do it at nighttime, when we can do it in a different kind of setting."
"Both those things I think are, it's possible that there's a subterranean back message being sent in the message."
"So, kind of like, metadata built into the message that's being sent that says ""I want to pay some attention to you"" on both sides."
We'll see what that attention's going to be in the coming books.
"So, things start to unfold rapidly and quickly in seventeen through twenty."
"Lots of the good stuff starts to, unpack itself here."
Looks Like her .. act like her ..
Identifies with with her ..
And might go further than that ..
"Then this famous person, starts to become the center of their lives"
"Then, it controls their lives"
In looks
In lifestyle
And even in their thoughts ..
They were Affected by her
Ane became ..
Little Monsters !
After the break ..
""" What ?"
"It has just started ? """
""" oh God hurry up -_- """
"When some is identified, with a famous character .."
We used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We
used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We used to wait.
Still moving through the pain.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to Dr. Eric Schmidt."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Thank you.
I'm over here.
I'm over here.
Thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; GÖKE:
"Mr. Schmidt, we're honored. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Thank you all, and thank you very much for having me back to this, such a gorgeous city and congratulations to this show for 50 plus years of great achievements."
"In the years that this show has been going on, there's been a lot of discussion about new ages, new eras, new ideas and I am absolutely convinced that we're about to see a new age, an age of augmented humanity."
"A time when computers will work for us, and they'll make it possible for us to do the things that we really want to do, which are mostly around people and happiness and making the world a better place."
"And when I think about the compute--the consumer electronics industry in particular, what you all have built over the years, we have an opportunity now to entertain, to inform, to educate with technology that we've never been able to do before."
And that's what I want to talk about in this show.
"Today, when you look at a consumer electronics product, think about it as a music player."
"If it's not connected to the internet, it just has what's stored on it."
It can't get the music that's nearby.
It can't get the latest music.
It has to be on the net.
The same is true of everything.
That change is very subtle.
40.
"So, please re, remember there's always one more point in time than the number of periods."
"If you remember that or if you recognize that, you'll be okay."
"So, how maNy points in time, 41."
"Zero, one through 40."
How many periods of time?
"Well, it takes two points of time to make a period, so there one less."
"One, two."
"So, what we'll do to make our life simple is we'll assume that the first $10,000 is at the end of the year."
Why did I do that?
I could always start saving at this point.
"But I'm doing it simply so that I can use the formula and, just directly, you know."
"Use the calculator, and do it, and setup."
"We can change that, so don't worry."
"You can start a payment today, and change it."
It's just a minor difference.
How much?
"Another thing that seems a little bit odd or manufactured in this formula is that you are saving at year 40 too, right, you may not be, right or actually messed up saving in between."
"So, but for convenience, we are trying to understand the problem which is got 40 of these guys, alright."
"So, the good news is even though this formula is very complicated, right, you divide this by how much?"
"I mean, you carry it forward by how much?"
One period but there's no money.
How much do you carry this forward by?
39 periods.
How much do you carry this forward by?
38.
Which is the simplest piece of this?
This guy.
Why?
"Because I'm askin g you, what is the future value at this point in time, alright."
"So, the future value of this point in time of this guy is just itself."
"That's the, that's what I mean, if you learn how to travel in time."
So weird.
"So just remember boys and girls,"
Photoshop is lying.
That's why I love video.
'Cuz you can see the ugly.
"You see so many models that  look fantastic on print but you put a camera on 'em and it's like ""AUlGHAUGHUAHF!"""
I'm sorry.
"That being said, video can lie too."
Lots of makeup and weird lighting.
I've known many a YouTuber to fame-fuck some ugly chick from Stickem.
"But internet, this Thursday I want to  leave you with a question."
Where were you 3 to 5 years ago and how has your life changed?
"Your friends, your family, job, school."
What's different?
And are ya happy about it?
"But guys, that's really all that mattered to me this Thursday."
"My name's Philip DeFranco, and you've just been Philled in."
AUlGHAUGHUAHF!
Hello and welcome of this demonstration of Simon's new dictation mode
This is by no means a finished product ... but really just a tech demo of what is currently possible ... ... with open-source speech recognition technology
"You can see it's basically the whole, same old Simon interface ... ... just this little box on the lower left will tip you off that something is different ... ... because it says active model is ""dictation demo"""
"So, let's see how it works"
Start dictation
This is a demo of Simon
New paragraph
"In this video, I want to demonstrate the current state of open-source dictation."
"As you can see, it is nowhere near perfect."
New paragraph
"Regardless, with a little bit more work, I'm sure we could turn this into something really useful."
"If you want to get involved, please do get in touch with me."
"Select ""him off"" involved"
Go to the end of the document
You just find the root of P and the root of Q and if you check if they're equal.
And then the union operation is simply find the two roots I and then set the idea the first one could be the second one.
"Actually less code than for Quick Find, no fore loops."
There's this one wild loop that we have to worry about a little bit.
But that's a quick and elegant implementation of code to solve the dynamic connectivity problem called
Quick-union.
So now we're going to have to look at can this code be effective for
large problems?
Well unfortunately Quick-union is faster but it's also too slow.
"And it's a little different kind of too slow then for Quick Find, there's times when it could be fast, but there's also times when it could be too slow."
And the defect for Quick-union is that the trees can get too tall.
Which would mean that the find operation would be too expensive.
You could wind up with a long skinny tree.
Of each object just pointing to next and then to do a find operation for object at the bottom would involve going all the way through the tree.
Costing involving in the ray axises just to do the find operation and that's going to be too slow if you have a lot of operations.
"Oh, Opalescence."
Can you just picture it?
"Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
"Why, yes!"
I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me."
Thank you.
What's that?
You wanna help me more!
"Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?"
Careful now.
Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
"Howdy, Rarity?"
Shh...
Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
There is no problem to convert it back to the flat base.
Use a permanent black marker to draw the face.
You can do it on front side of the base or front side of the cabin.
"Two eyes, nose, big smile."
Simple drawing.
OK.
I am going to cut off funny tails from the top of the crane tower.
It would make the sculpture simpler and our crane more recognizable.
Here is the crane with one funny tail on the top.
Instead of funny tails on the top of the crane.
I am going to twist soft about one inch bubble.
Lock both ends of this bubble in one lock twist.
Cut off the rest of the balloon.
This bubble covers all the knots we have made on the top.
"Congratulations, we have made the crane."
In this instruction we used different color balloons to make the crane.
Here is an example of a crane tower made of four green balloons.
You may notice some minor differences in this sculpture.
The crane's arm has extra bubble.
The cabin is different as well.
I added extra row bubbles to the green tower and the green cabin.
Here is the side view.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
Usually I don't use black marker to make any drawings on dark color balloons.
It is just wasting of your time.
Let me show it to you.
Black is hardly visible on a dark background.
"Anyway, let's finish the face."
We can use technique described in this instruction to make large scale sculptures or parts of large sculptures.
"For example we can use it to make a torso, a leg, an arm, a cake, a vase, a hat and so on."
Have fun and happy twisting :)
And it is possible.
You just have to splint with something else.
You splint with bamboo and gauze.
And you need several people to pull.
The most important aspect was politeness.
You explained what you were going to do and what they could expect.
Compassion was more important than the medical performance.
My medical training said the opposite.
"You could behave badly, but you had to follow the latest research."
In Africa you did the best you could.
But you could never compromise on how you treated people.
In rough deliveries you could save the mother by fetal skull decompression.
"If the fetus was dead, you had to put a hole in its head to get it out."
It could save the mother's life when it was too late to do a caesarean.
But first you had to explain to the grandmother that the baby was stuck.
"""I can get it out, but the head will be destroyed."""
"- ""No matter."
"Will she live?"""
"- ""Maybe."
"I can't promise anything."""
"You reasoned with the disciplinary board, or else things went bad."
These are the konzo patients.
It's from 21 August 1981.
That's a date that is etched into Hans Rosling's memory.
That day the request for help came on the back of a cinema ticket from a village in the country.
The Italian nun worked as a sort of district nurse.
She wrote that she had 30 crippled women and children with both legs paralyzed.
She'd been nursing for 20 years and never seen anything like it.
The first woman I examined had extremely sharp reflexes.
That means it's a spastic paralysis.
"Sort of like MS, but the symptoms developed in one day."
I saw immediately that I had never seen anything like this before.
There's a kind of a lot going on now with the online and open access.
Right.
Can you say a little bit about what's gonna happen for in the future.
[laugh].
"But you described, [laugh]."
"You know, more, less paper, more electronic, [laugh]."
Publications.
It'll appear faster.
Yeah.
"You know, like e-Pub before, before it appears."
Right.
In the paper version.
There'll be more new journal.
"I keep getting emails from journals that just started up, you know, and they'll make it sound like it's your field."
And there's probably not such great peer review with them.
They wanna.
"This time they might get some known authors and publish but the, I have had a paper."
"You know which was submitted to a journal that's supposed to be peer reviewed and, and the acceptance came back in about five days."
[laugh]
Right.
You know?
"So I don't think it was really peer reviewed I, of course you know I'm biased but I thought it was a decent paper and, but I don't think it got the kind of peer review that papers normally get from good journals."
"Do you think peer reviews going to be, gonna change somewhat in the future because of this proliferation of online journals?"
Say that again.
"Do you think that the peer review process itself is going to change them like, because of the proliferation of online journals?"
"Well, it shouldn't, but it, it might."
I'm not sure how.
Yeah.
"You know, if they're really in a hurry to publish, they might say, you know, get your review back in a week or, you know."
Yeah.
A lot of people just can't do that.
"That fast, yeah."
"Zombies are at an all-time low level, but the fear of zombies could be incredibly high."
"It doesn't mean we have to have government policies to deal with the fear of zombies,"
"It's ridiculous, for Christ's sake."
The NHS...
"There was a survey in the NHS about dentistry, where they found that some people were removing their own teeth!"
You know...
"And they brought on some senior dentists onto Sky News, and gave out to him, and said"
"""This is terrible, People are removing their own teeth!"" And this guy stood there and went"
"""Well, obviously systems should be put in place to deal with it."""
Which is stupid!
"He should be going ""Well, these people are clearly morons of the highest line"""
[Laughter]
"""Who removes their own teeth, for Christ's sake?"
"I'm a dentist, I don't remove my own teeth, y'know what I mean?"""
But there's kind of a notion that everyones opinion is equally valid.
My arse!
Bloke who's a professor of dentistry for 40 years does not have a debate with some idiot who removes his teeth with string and a door.
Alright?
It's nonsense.
And it happens all the time with medical stuff on the television.
"They'll have a doctor on and they'll talk to the doctor, and they're all ""doctor this, and doctor that"" and"
"""what happened there"" and ""doctor, isn't it awful?"" Right?"
"And then the doctor will be talking about something, with all the benefits of research and medical evidence."
"And they'll turn away from the doctor, in the name of ""ballance"", and turn to some quak, witch doctor, homeopath horse shit peddler on the other side of the studio."
[Laughter]
♪ (eerie music) ♪
I love this game so much!
God damn it.
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, no."
(Finebros) You are going to play this game.
What?
The testing shows that Nathan excels at visual and spatial perceptions.
Fantastic.
What I would like you to do next is write the alphabet for me from A to Z and join all the letters together as if the whole alphabet was one long word.
And
"I'm going to time you to see how long it takes you, OK?"
"Ready, go."
Along with his tally sheet of strengths there are significant weaknesses.
M-- I forgot how to do one letter.
Were you forgetting how to make the letter or were you forgetting which letter came next?
Forgetting how to write it.
"Yeah, how to write it."
So you knew what letter you wanted to write?
And could you picture it in your mind?
I could picture it in my mind but I just couldn't--
Couldn't remember the procedure for making that letter?
So let me give you some others now and see how you do.
Dr. Levine now knows something vital.
Nathan knows what the letter K looks like.
But it's simply too much work to write it down.
Kids like this have what is known as an output problem.
These are kids for whom work is too much work.
Effort is too much effort.
And they sit down to do something and you'd think they'd have to climb the
Matterhorn.
And these same kids tantalize everyone because their intake is so good.
They're so good at understanding things.
They're so good at analyzing.
"Often, they're very creative."
A lot of times they're a wellspring of phenomenal ideas.
"But to be productive, to get some output, to be efficient in your output, is sort of out of the question."
"Nathan, do you see only designs here?"
It's as if within the mind of the child with a learning problem there are three clocks.
They are anti-White.
They are NOT against racism.
They are against the continued existence of all White people and only White people.

"All right, so on Monday, we spoke with Shirley Phelps-Roper about allegations that the internet gathering known as Anonymous had issued a threat, and Westboro Baptist Church responded to that threat."
"Well, today we have everybody here, we have Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church."
"We have a source within Anonymous, the internet gathering known as Anonymous, here."
So let's start at the very beginning.
"Anonymous, can you please tell us, did any active Anonymous members or participants, sources, issue a threat to the Westboro Baptist Church?"
"-No, there was no talk of it."
"The press release was... -Well, how could you know this?"
I was wondering...
"-Well, hold on, Shirley, let's get him to explain... -They're anonymous!"
I'm just saying.
-Let's have him explain.
"-Well, Shirley, with most operations, we have planning, we have execution, we have discussion of it."
"This press release came out of nowhere, and it doesn't seem like the writing style we'd make."
"Nobody that usually writes press releases stood up and said hey, we wrote this."
"The operation came out of nowhere, and you guys responded really too fast."
It was all a bit suspicious.
"-Oh, yikes!"
It was several days before we responded.
"-So Shirley, let's..."
let's take it one at a time.
"How did you originally hear of the threat, Shirley?"
By many emails.
"We received many emails, and then, how else?"
"Oh, also in some print publications."
"Twitter, Twitter was talking about it."
"Oh, and Twitter was sending us links to it, also."
"OK, so Anonymous, can you state... do you, what is your belief?"
Do you believe that the Westboro Baptist Church concocted this letter?
"But once you have the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard deviation."
You just take the square root of it.
The square root of 7.76-- 2.78.
Let's say 2.79 is the standard deviation.
"So this gives us some measure of, on average, how far the numbers are away from the mean which was 4.2."
And it gives it in kind of the units of the original measurement.
"Anyway, I'm all out of time."
I'll see you in the next video.
"Or actually, let's figure out-- we said if this was a sample, if those numbers were sample and not the population, that we figured out that the sample variance was 9.7."
And so then the sample standard deviation is just going to be the square root of that.
The square root of 9.7 seven which would be 3.1.
3.11.
"Anyway, hopefully that makes it a little bit more concrete."
We've been dealing with these sigma notation variables and all that so far.
So when you actually do it with numbers you see it's hopefully not that difficult.
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
Fucking Christ.
What the fuck?
"One minute I'm minding my own business - shoot'n pool, downing shots of who-the-fuck-knows-what and suddenly.."
POOOOOOF
I mean fairy-fucking-godmother?!?
How the hell is this her jurisdiction?
Man. my head.
What the hell was in those shots?
I mean seriously.
All i did was rent a few dogs.
Oh.. and sewed a few sticks to their heads.
Alright. and glued a red light to that little ones nose but fucking christ give me a break...
I did a dime of shrooms earlier.
I needed some light. and (chuckling) i thought he looked cute.
Is that a fucking crime?!?
"How was I to know that abandoned sled in front of city hall belonged to some ""princess""?!?"
I read in my neurology book... ...and there was only one similar disease.
I realized this might be a totally new disease.
I was so scared.
I was scared to death.
Your first thought is that you might get infected yourself.
"You examine sick people, thinking only of yourself."
I had to take a deep breath and tell myself that this was my job.
I examined 30 people and it was an epidemic.
When I got home I sent Agneta and the kids away.
They went to friends' houses and those of us who had met the patients stayed in our house.
After two weeks we were sure that the disease was only in the country.
It was a combination of malnutrition and toxicity - nothing contagious.
Those were two scary weeks.
"Konzo was caused by cassava roots, the only food that survived drought."
"The root contains toxic cyanide, which takes time to remove."
But people were too hungry.
They ate it immediately and were paralyzed.
My scientific articles are in the two bottom drawers...
The disease was called konzo and turned into a research project with a hundred published articles.
"In Sweden, Hans Rosling was bothered by the worldview he met."
Particularly about Africa.
"When your worldview differs so much from reality, facts are interesting."
"If you think Indian women have six or seven children and you learn the average is 2.7, that's interesting."
There have been huge changes.
Child mortality in Egypt is fairly well documented.
25 years ago 20% of children in Egypt died before age five.
Today it's 4%.
From 20 to 4.
A dramatic improvement.
Child health in Egypt has improved faster than it ever did here.
But no one knows that.
Do our news report on the fantastic improvement in child health in Egypt?
I want you to try it.
"If you haven't tried this, go to Publix, Whole Foods, and get all this food at Publix and Whole Foods."
It is really amazing.
"If you try it out on your family, you tell them it's meat,"
I'd love to see the response they give.
It really is good stuff.
"And remember, all meat, dairy and egg products go through a process."
It doesn't just magically form.
"In this case, the process involves killing, cooking, pasteurization, refrigeration, freezing, and we can not forget the all important seasoning."
"I remember going to McDonald's as a child, and I didn't just get a slab of meat."
"A slab of meat had herbs and spices put into it, was put on the grill, cooked, and then it came to me with a bun,"
"lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and onions."
And a pickle.
What all those things are made of?
Plants
"We put condiments, spice and herbs on the meat to make it taste better, in fact, what would meat be without plants?"
It would just be a dead animal.
Would be a carcass on your plate.
It would be no different from road kill.
"So the word of the day is ""Vegan""."
"A vegan is somebody who chooses not to eat any meat, dairy, eggs or fish."
"And again, how is this extreme?"
How is it extreme not to be drinking the milk of any other species?
How is it extreme not to be eating hen periods?
How is it extreme not to be participating in a system that unnecessarily kills animals?
"A lot of kids say, even after all this,they are still like"
"""What do I eat as vegan""?"
"Now, all these products are vegan."
"There is no meat, no dairy, no eggs."
But this is all crap.
This is unhealthy.
This is the junk food vegan.
"When you say, i'm born this way"
"What is the thing that your community can't accept about you, Lady Gaga does ?"
"Nadim: "" about "" Born This Way I want to tell the world, that I was Born This Way """
What way ?
"Nadim: "" My personality is revolutionary in the community """
What is that you don't like about the community ?
"Nadim: "" The artistic things """
"Lady Gaga concentrates on Social issues too, What Issues are those ?"
"What does Lady Gaga once did, and you said, I have that iddue in my community ?"
"Nadim: "" People's physical appearance """
"Nadim: "" Relationship between people, who's based on lies, and they judge you for how you look like """
"Nadim: ""and they lie about you, they always judge looks """
What are Lady Gaga's ideas and thoughts ?
We talked about the love lately

"At schools and anywhere else, and also the gay community """
"She's defending the gay community so clearly, in every song ?"
Nadim:

That's one way to think about it.
"But there are other ways which would describe the same quantity, right?"
"I could have divided the cake into six pieces, and picked two of those pieces."
Right?
"So, the one third we normally write one over three, and this thing we might say two parts of six, and we could write two over six, and we see, already, another issue, which is what?"
"We have two different fractions, but they represent the same thing."
Right?
Sorry my microphone is... it really is falling.
Ok.
"So, this brings us to a concept here, which is... ok, well, we have two ways of representing the same thing."
Two ways of representing the same thing.
These two things are in some sense... we want them to be equi... equivalent.
[Laughter].
Equivalent.
Ok?
"So maybe we want to set up a construction that's... where we define fractions in terms of equivalence relations, ok?"
How are we going to do that?
What will the equivalence relation be?
"So, how about this?"
"Let's take any construction like... any picture like this, and if I want the associated fraction,"
I'll think of one over three as an ordered pair.
"So maybe I'll do the following, in the first picture I'm picking one part out of three, and in the second picture I'm picking two parts out of six, and I'll think of these as equivalent ordered pairs."
Ok?
"And to make this a sentence, I might say write that as equivalent ordered pairs, period."
All right?
Ok.
"And then, what I will do, if I can is, once I figure out what all the things that are in the... that are equivalent are, the idea is that these belong to some equivalence class."
That might have lots of other things in it.
Right?
Like ten coma thirty.
Right?
Or a hundred and twenty one coma... why do I torture myself?
I have the dream that one  day everyone will be able... ...to walk around safely without  worrying about being bullied.
When we think about bullying... ...we typically think about one child bullying another on the playground.
But bullying is far more pervasive.
"People get bullied in  school, their workplace... ...on Facebook and  sometimes even at home."
"People get bullied because  of the clothes they wear... car they drive, music they  listen to or their profession."
The question that comes to my  mind when I think of bullying is... ...What does it achieve?
Does bullying bring inner-happiness?
Does it result in lasting power?
Does it really build self-confidence?
"On the contrary, it is simply a reflection of the bully's own lack of self-worth, ...dissatisfaction and fear."
There are many ways that we can address bullying.
Supporting others is a great preventative strategy.
"If EVERYONE were supported, it would help others be strong and proud of who... ...they are so that THEY  can pursue their dreams."
I dream of a world where EVERYONE can get the support they need to thrive.
Where they are NOT put down by others.
Where they can proud be of who they are and proud of who they want to be.
[applause]
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you.
"Becuase of bullying, many great ideas have been lost."
"People have become depressed, inflicted pain on themselves... ...committed suicide, or turned  their hurt and anger on others."
They have been permanently scarred and... ...hurt because of the  words and actions of others.
"They question their existence, their self-worth."
All because of bullying.
I have a dream that one day all of this will be gone.
No more ideas lost.
No more hurt feelings.
No more suicides.
"No more ""let bullying be gone forever."""
[applause]
We can do it if we start taking  the issue of bullying a priority.

There must be another plan in order to find out where the money is
This money is for you and the others
It's more than what my kids would've given you
I didn't think you'd be able to convince the others to do this
Money can do anything but I didn't do this for the money
I did this because I felt guilty for what I did to you
"I know, that's why I depended on you"
"Take the money, mona"
And what do you intend on doing now?
"Listen, all this means that I couldn't properly raise my kids"

What if they don't come?

How efficient has the planet become at capturing photons?
"Does it capture 50%, 10%, 1%, 1/10^(th) of a percent?"
A guess?
How many for 50% Hands up.
How many for 10%?
Hands up.
A couple.
How many for 1%?
Hands up.
How many for 1/10^(th) of a percent?
Hands up.
See the grad students think it's a 1/10^(th) of a percent.
It's a small amount.
"I don't know the precise number, but it's down between 1/10 and 1% I think."
"So even after 3.5 billion years of evolutionary history, the planet has not become terribly efficient at capturing sunlight."
Freeman Dyson has got this definition of different kinds of civilizations.
One of the stages of civilization would be when you can put a sphere around an entire solar system and capture all of the photons coming off of the sun and harness it for running a civilization.
That would capture the entire solar output.
"Well, you know, we are a tiny little dot on the face of the sun, and we're taking 1/10^(th) to 1% of its photons."
So this isn't a very big number when you look at the solar output.
"What happens is that basically algae, primarily algae, but also trees and all other larger plants, are capturing this."
Then the herbivores are eating the plants.
The primary carnivores are eating the herbivores.
The secondary carnivores are eating the primary carnivores.
"What do you think is in the red arrows, going off to the detritivores?"
"In simple Anglo-Saxon, four letter words, what do you think is in the red arrow?"

Any idea what Africa would look like if you got rid of the dung beetles?
You would need hip-waders; especially in the Serengeti or any of the big national parks.
Scientists were studying sharks off the coast of Florida using an acoustic tracking system.
"In the shallow bay, a locator signal every 15 minutes tracked their movements."
"Then one day, the sharks just disappeared."
And no one knew why.
"At the time, people had bigger problems."
A category four storm was bearing down on the Gulf Coast.
[thunder]
"Analyzing the data, scientists discovered sharks detected the drop in barometric pressure preceding the storm."
They bolted from their shallow nursery to the safety of deeper waters.
"Twelve hours later,"
Hurricane Charlie ripped across Florida.
"When the storm was over, the sharks returned."
"Reef sharks kick off the Survivor countdown because, thanks to incredible senses, they dodge disaster."
"Other animals are not so lucky-- battling adversity for days, months, or years."
One fifth of the Earth's surface is desert.
Baking hot.
Bone dry.
To survive here takes a special kind of animal... and special humans to catch them.
"In the Outback of Australia, these guys are hunting the next survivor sprinting into number 9-- the camel."
"Introduced in the 19th century, camels thrived in the arid land."
Now they're pests.
Rounded up and sent back to the Middle East.
Try running through a desert without water or shade... and you'd be dead in a day.
Camels barely break a sweat.
Camels can go eight days without water.
One secret for survival is on their back.
Camels store fat--not water-- in their hump.
It's a portable pantry.
"By burning all the fat in its hump, a camel can survive without food for up to a month."
"When a camel finds water, it soaks it up like a sponge."
A thirsty animal chugs 30 gallons in 13 minutes.
"Try that at home, and your blood cells would burst."
"""Nice and quiet around here."""
"If there was more land, then he bought some more pigs, a few chickens and some cows."
"""Well that's a fine kettle of fish."""
You know what!
All that grubbing around outside takes far too long.
We're going to fatten you up and fast.
It's not a fairytale storybook.
You're there to be eaten.
"""Errrrr ... not sure that's such a compliment, really."""
"We'll squeeze you altogether nice and efficiently, and you'll all get sick right away."
"""You're telling me ..."""
"Listen Piggy, I'm not interested in your personal vision right now."
"In the Netherlands alone, you lot produce 70 billion kilos of dung, do you know how bad that is for the environment and the climate?"
"""Uh ..."
"I'm sorry for living."""
"Did you know that cows of all farm animals are the largest producers of greenhouse gasses, mostly through all that belching and farting?"
Do you know what the problem is?
You're eating us out of house and home!
"""Who was here so pleased about fattening us up?"""
"But all that food has to come from somewhere, doesn't it?"
So ... we destroy the rainforests and plant soya crops instead.
But the rainforests are really important for the absorption of carbon dioxide.
Then we spray the stuff with pesticides and we ship the soya off the Europe where it ends up in your feeding-troughs.
So well-organised.
What are you people up to?
"""Oh-oh, well that's not our fault."
"Who actually wants to eat meat anyway?"""
"The consumer, OK, is there something wrong with that?"
Well.
"That's a good question, who actually eats so much meat?"
Eating meat is a luxury that we've got all rather too used to.
Don't dare touch our steaks!

"In the summer of 1995 under my grandfather's favorite reading chair, I found a tattered"
Webster's International Dictionary.
In the back were ganged together and printed all the wonderful images from the book; a little universe of 19th century America.
"Little did I know I was about to devote the next 10 years of my life to organizing and printing 4,000 of these little blocks."
The Merriam Webster Company gifted these engravings to Yale University in 1977.
They now live in the press room of the Arts of the Book Collection.
I was enthralled when I first had a chance to see the engravings themselves.
I was fascinated by the numbers stamped and written onto their sides.
I spent much of 1997 identifying and organizing the collection into categories.
"I estimate there are about 13,000 of these little blocks."
Here are carriages and footware.
I used photocopies from the dictionaries to identify the blocks.
I then culled the images I was to print and organized them alphabetically.
Each engraving was logged out as part of a special loan agreement.
"At Quercus Press engravings were cleaned, often revealing amazing manuscript."
Most engravings were not type-high.
"Using various bits of paper, the engravings could be made"
level and raised so they could be printed properly.
Each engraving was then measured for labeling.
The latin names were added for flora and fauna.
The labels were then cast on my 1938 Model 8 linotype machine.
The linotype is really 3 machines at once.
"It composes a line of type, passes it, then redistributes it."
It's all done used these little brass mats.
"Roller skates, reservoirs, anything."
And they will go break that in your home.
"If people have access to the necessities of life, they don't kill, they don't steal, if they are educated properly also."
"Now, for the people that are afraid that there is a bunch of scientists, you would work on the area D, all that is bull."
All that is what you get from the television shows.
There is no need to control people.
"None or whatsoever, in an abundant society."
"We don't want people to have houses, and then go out and buy the furniture."
"We think that, like your automobile."
"You don't have to buy seats, it comes with everything."
So we want to mold all that in the house.
"Jacque and Roxanne build models for films they make, to spread the message of The Venus Project."
"So people say, all my buildings are alike."
They are not.
"If you carefully look at them, there is a widest range of variables."
"Some people say, i don't know that i want to live in a dome."
Your brain is in a dome.
You have been living in a dome all your life.
This is how we make our apartments.
"We change the dive, they changes the shape."
And then pressure.
"Moves a composite material forward, then we cut it."
And then this machine lifts it.
"And this machine, in certain improvement onto that."
Do you understand?
"No humans do any work, any kind of work at all."
Except what you would like to do.
"Art, music, play right, travel, scuba diving."
It wont take 7000 or less people to run everything on Earth.
You need everybody anymore.
"With the advent of automation and nanotechnology, we will make machines enabled to do most of the work."
"There is no such thing as Utopia, as the best as you can design up to now."
If people better understand what's happening in the world they can make better decisions.
Whether they run a company or are activists wanting a new world or are members of a government.
Everyone needs to know how the world looks.
TED Conference Los Angeles 2009
Hans's theme:
8 minutes on HlV
The HlV problem in Africa is not due to poverty.
"The poorer you are, the lower the risk of your having HlV."
The richer part of the continent has more HlV than the poorer.
We don't know why HlV is so common in eastern and southern Africa.
In Ghana less than 3% are infected and in Senegal less than 1%.
But sexual differences between cultures is a sensitive issue so no one does research into it.
They research other things instead.
- Is it a cultural issue?
- It's probably multiple partners.
In parts of southern and eastern Africa the majority of the adult population has 2-3 sex partners.
"It's not that it's a cultural norm or rule, but it is accepted."
There are cultural roots and it's accepted.
It's also related to the fact that sex is a bartering tool.
When you sell your maize you offer sexual favors to raise the price.
Let's see if I...
We've got a lot of information here.
This is very important...
"A yearbook photo, 7th grade class at the Domarringen school."
This is Agneta Thordeman.
We went to school together and have lived together for 40 years.
She started working in healthcare early on and that got me interested.
I decided to apply to medical school.
"In 1972, halfway through med school"
Hans and Agneta took a trip to India.

Hans Rosling became aware of his own prejudices about the world.
MT:
"Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets."
NT:
"Yes, that was a big mistake."
MT:
Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.
He became a recluse.
"Dodged by death, he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria."
NT:
"Everything I did, I did for mankind, for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich, where products of intellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life."
MT:
"Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January, 1943."
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.
His legacy is with us still.
"Tesla became the man who lit the world, but this was only the beginning."
Tesla's insight was profound.
NT:
"Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear, and the coal deposits are exhausted?"
MT:
Tesla thought he had the answer.
We are still asking the question.
Thank you.

"If I give overpowered cheated items to noobs, arguments will start in the groups,"
"The green-eyed monster, the demon of jealousy will tear them apart,"
"And then, bored, disgusted of MMORPG, they will return to the real life."

OK then.
"Mmm, I won't manage to persuade them right now,"
The slugs are then trimmed to exactly match the width of the engravings.
The forms of engravings and slugs are then set as pages.
The page form is filled with bits of leading.
Here's my setup for making engravings.
A jig for engraving small blocks.
Some slugs needed underlay for the I's and L's to print properly.
"This is the final packing layer for a run, showing the make ready."
I spent an additional year writing the pancreas section.
"""Here we are at Quercus Press, on 6/6/06."
"Printing the last, well the first of the last of the runs of the Pictorial Webster's."""
I used the labels from the book to create a marbleized text pattern.
"First the yellow run is printed, then the reds, and finally the green and blue."
"""Is this really the last one?"
"Here it is."""
"""Last one!"""
"""And this is the speed I printed the book, basically; that real slow speed."""
"""Alright that's it."
"Hooray!"""
Next began the binding process.
"For hundreds of years, binders have cut and folded sections this way."
"The Pictorial Webster's had over 5,000 sections to fold."
The sections have holes punched for sewing.
"Using a sewing frame, the books are sewn on double flexible rolled linen tapes with supported kettles."
"Because the sewing is so time consuming, I invited 11 bookbinders to Strong Arm Bindery in Maine where we managed to sew 50 books in a weekend."
"After a book is sewn the spines are pasted up, the edges are trimmed,"
the book is rounded and backed.
The edges are prepared for decoration and edge decoration is applied using rubber stamps.
The endbands are sewn.
The spine is lined with airplane linen and paper and a hollow is formed on the book.
Boards are attached.
"The leather is pared,"
"it gets wetted out, then pasted up."
Not the best idea.

Welcome to the latest edition of Inside CBA.
So many great things have been happening here in the College of Business Administration that I though the best way to convey them is through video so you can literally see for yourself.
"In September, the Nebraska Board of Regents approved plans for our new 240,000 square foot building."
This 84 million dollar project will be privately funded.
"In 2016 when the building's completed, we'll have a facility that will allow us to attract students and faculty from around the world and help us with our growing enrollments."
This fall our freshmen enrollments exploded by a 25.4 percent increase over last year.
And our first time transfer students were up by almost 16 percent.
"Our goal as a college is to hit $5,000 students in accordance with the chancellors charge that UNL's total enrollment should reach 30,000 by 2017."
Size matters.
"For our undergraduate program, enhancing the size of the student body and the faculty provide greater opportunities to find their niche, to locate a mentor who can direct them to their passion, to explore a wider set of opportunities than they can imagine when they graduate from high school."
I'm going to a party with Hollywood folks.
And I'm going to wear this.
We got the name Gapminder from the London underground.
American hotels almost always have an iron in every room so you can look your best.
A little note for Agneta...
There...
It's a new phase of a strange journey for Hans Rosling.
From a doctor in Africa to a professor of international health and most recently a global star with an unusual message:
The world is actually getting better.
He's on his way back to the scene of his breakthrough.
"It's California's ""Davos"" meeting, where Silicon Valley meets Hollywood."
The room is full of key people of industry and entertainment.
From movie stars to film producers.
"The conference is called Technology, Entertainment and Design."
I was invited to it in 2006 and it changed my life.
Yesterday the WHO's statistics manager e-mailed me after I'd requested malaria statistics.
He wrote:
"""I always send your video to my friends, of course I'll help."""
"If I count the number of minutes I've been teaching, this video teaches more than anything I've done in my life."
"All the articles, books, courses..."
None of it can compare with this one video.
That's a humbling experience.
Uppsala University wanted a course in global development.
"The ""Man and Nature"" course had students from many fields."
"Their worldview was cartoonish - really ""us and them""."
They were convinced that no one should touch rainforests.
"That we have to lower our standards, not everyone can have electricity."
I was horrified at their attitude and lack of knowledge.
They thought developing countries lived in harmony in the rain forest.
Only a fraction of so-called devel- oping countries live that way.
So I did a graph with money on one axis and child mortality on the other.
"The idea of ""industrial"" and ""developing"" countries is bullshit."
[Indistinct muttering]
We've now chosen three dishes that stood out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Really stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first person we'd like&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is...
You know that you want to call my name.
"Please, please, call my name."
Ryan.
Let's go.
[Applause]
I'm really not surprised that my plate is one of the top dishes.
These other cooks are gonna have to step up their game if they're gonna want to compete with me.
The next person we'd like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to invite down&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"- Samantha. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go, Samantha.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
I was one of the only people that decided to do something truly new.
I think a lot of people are gonna be jealous of me.
The third person... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please come down...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Scott. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
My mind is just racing.
I know that I wasn't 100% proud of this dish.
It was not executed properly.
Congratulations.
"I mean, your three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- stood out.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you, chef."
Thank you.
You managed to cook what we think are the worst three dishes &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of this mystery box challenge.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Listen carefully. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This season,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we've rewritten&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the rule books,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so none of you should ever get&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;too comfortable&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;in this kitchen,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because we could ask you to leave at any time, starting now."
What?
(Becky) We're all gobsmacked.
We just can't believe it.
It's crazy to me.
"And I'm just like, what the heck is gonna happen now?"
"Okay, we'll taste all three dishes."
Whoever we decide has plated the absolute worst dish will be handing back their apron.
"Ryan, bring your dish up to the station, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (Ryan) I made a balsamic, rum-glazed duck breast with some caramelized bananas."
Are you proud of this?
And I would encourage you to read critically not just like a consumer.
Finally.
I hope this class motivates you to learn.
Learning is a very powerful thing in life.
"And I, I, I'll talk about it a little bit later more in depth."
"But when you learn more, learn Finance."
"And the reason is, if you know Finance, you pretty much know most of anything you want to know in life."
And I'm kind of serious about it.
"[laugh], You know that's, that's the funny part."
"So objectives, why you want to do, think about it."
And I hope you're convinced that this is something that you really need to learn.
What are the prerequisites?
"I've been receiving emails about, prerequisites."
"This is a question that we always get, here in life classes, and this is very tough for me."
"Because fundamentally, it could be everything in life, or nothing."
"Some prerequisites could be nothing, or everything."
Why am I saying that?
"It's because if you're go into the detail of development of Finance, the first thing that's the basis of Finance is Economics."
And Economics is actually called the mother discipline of Finance.
It has borrowed mostly from that discipline.
"So,"
I would encourage you to know that.
"Behavioral Science is also becoming important over time, but economics remains the basic paradigm."
Accounting.
"I must admit, Accounting, though I know some of it, is kind of boring."
"And, but it's a"
language.
"I mean, it's like, if you didn't understand me because I'm speaking"
"English, there would be a problem."
"Similarly, if you don't understand accounting, you cannot understand what's going on."
"And because it's imperfect, like every other language, you really have to know it."
"I promise you, I will give you hints of what to do when we do accounting, because we can't do all of it."
And the Pentecostal Church accepts that a member has a legal abortion.
This was 1948.
I lived in the Luthagen district of Uppsala.
"We had one room, a kitchen, a privy in the yard and cold running water."
I remember Mom doing the laundry by hand with a washing board.
"A washing machine requires electricity, steel and detergent."
And it consumes energy.
But almost everyone in Sweden uses one.
Even the core of the environmental movement.
They probably use a low temperature and only good chemicals.
But if you ask Swedes if everyone in India should have a washing machine many would say that not every Indian household should.
They don't get that people are all the same.
"If I have a washing machine, so should everyone else."
People think Indians shouldn't have washing machines?
Not if they think about it.
But that's the general reaction.
Isn't it really that they're poor and can't afford one?
Consider the planning for how much electricity is needed on earth.
"Work out what we need for lighting, a washing machine, radio and TV."
That gives you the power we need.
None of my students have suggested that the world should be planned for that consumption.
"They hope ""those"" people will be playing flutes under the mango tree."
Isn't that a very generalized image of the students?
"There's a lot of variation, but a surprisingly large number hope that development will stop."
They think it's unsustainable.
We often hear that we already live beyond our means.
"""Everyone can't live like us."
"All Chinese people can't have cars."""
That's what we usually hear.
But the world can't function if we don't all live about the same.
How can the world unite if we don't live in the same conditions?
There's such appeal in having electricity and having some kind of holiday.
And twist the third red bubble.
Lock the free end of the third pinnk and red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the third gray bubble.
And twist the third yellow bubble.
Lock the free ends of the third gray and yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Alright.
Let's take a look on our sculpture.
"Basically, we are making the same fabric as we did in previously published instructions"
"""Fabric 2"", ""Fabric 3""."
The big difference here is we connect both ends of each row in this sculpture.
Twist the fourth yellow and the fourth red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the fourth yellow and fourth red bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the fourth gray and twist the fourth pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the fourth gray and fourth pink bubble in one lock twist.
Keep working in the same fashion.
We can make as many rows as we want.
In this example we use only four balloons to build the tower.
We can use any even number of balloons to build larger in diameter tower.
There is also no limit how high you can make it.
Just add balloons as you need it.
Here is time saving way to make this sculpture.
Hold and twist balloons together to make the bubbles and
lock the ends in one lock twist in one move.
Twisting different size bubbles will definitely distort the tower.
Fix it right away.
I have mentioned before that we can make the tower as tall as we want.
"Let's limit our self here, for this instruction."
So far we have twisted six rows.
Or six bubbles of each color.
Now we have to build a cabin on the top of the crane tower.
We can make different size bubbles to make the cabin in different ways.
Let's do it in the simplest way.
"Yes, the wounds lasted for some time."
And did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
I believe they were stigmata.
"By that, you mean supernatural injuries... ...that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ?"
Yes.
"Stigmata are a sign, a mark indicating one is touched by God."
"After that night, why do you think Emily refused another exorcism?"
I believe she'd accepted her fate.
Is there anything else you'd like to say about Emily?
No.
The defense rests.
Father Moore attaches divine significance... ...to the wounds on Emily's hands and feet.
Why?
Because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.
"That Emily was a saint, touched by the hand of God."
I'm afraid the truth is far less inspiring.
"Because the truth is, by the time these miraculous wounds appeared... ...Emily had already shown a tendency to injure herself... ...and simply did so again on one of the barbed-wire fences... ...surrounding the Rose family farm."
Father Moore's beliefs are based on archaic and irrational superstition.
Emily suffered because she was sick... ...not because she was a saint.
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.
"And in here, facts are what must matter."
And these are the facts of this case:
"Emily Rose had epilepsy, which caused psychosis."
"And, given time, medicine would have cured her."
But it didn't.
Why?
"Because Father Richard Moore convinced Emily... ...that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine."
And in the weeks leading up to her death... ...when she was clearly in need of medical treatment... ...he failed to have her hospitalized.
So... ...the defense has given us an extraordinary... ...creative explanation for the events that led to this.
"Ladies and gentlemen, don't you believe it."
"Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil that did this to Emily Rose."
"So, avoid repetition, avoid excess verbiage."
And ...
"Yes, I've used it. ..."
I've written [laugh] editorials about that which I think you've used it.
I've used.
Yes [laugh].
"And Avoid, you know, sometimes people will write a rather long discussion in the introduction of the paper, where it's, really, the introduction should be."
"Brief, and say why you did this study and what you, basically what you what you tried to accomplish."
But leave all the discussion the review of the literature for the discussion section.
"Don't try to, to put too much in the introduction."
Some things are certainly you need some background.
As to why you did this study.
Which may involve citing some previous
"literature, but don't go into detail."
"At that's, in the introduction."
And .
Don't repeat numerical data in the text.
"You know, you'll have a table which has nice, numerical data with odds ratios and so on, and then there's, in the results, saying table one shows the blah, blah, blah and the odds ratio was this and that and, so avoid repeating that."
"We will often ask authors, you know, just describe."
The finding of the table in words.
And they can see.
The reader can see the numerical examples.
"Good, yeah."
So those are my main suggestions.
Those are good tips.
"Yeah, and you know, one of the, the fears I think that comes up often when I'm teaching a course like this."
"And it's already come up in this class is, a lot of scientists will say to me well I, you know, you know, I've been teaching them to write in simple and concise language."
And they'll say well if I simplify it to much I'm gonna dumb down the science.
It's gonna lose precision.
Mm-mm.
And.
So there's this kind of fear that a lot of scientists have.
Always getting the short end of the stick.
Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture.
"You domesticate some animals, and then you take them on the road with you."
The advantages of herding are obvious.
First: you get to be a cowboy.
"Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter, because they can provide with wool and leather."
"The downside is that you have to move around a lot, because your herd always needs new grass, which makes it harder to build cities."
Unless you are the Mongols.
"By the way, for the next 14 weeks, you will frequently hear generalization followed by"
"""Unless you are the Mongols"""
"But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on certain parts of the world is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication."
"Like, you have sheep, goats, caddle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all of which have something in common: they aren't native to the Americas."
The only half-way useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama.
"No, not that llama."
Two Ls.
"Yes, that llama."
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
"Like, hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat."
But unfortunately they like to eat people.
Zebras are too ornery; grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken.
"Elephants are awesome, but they take way too long to breed."
"Which reminds me, it's time for the open letter."
Elegant.
But first let's see what the secret compartment has for me today.
"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger."
Thanks secret compartment.
"Just kidding, I don't thank you for this."
An open letter to elephants.
"Hey, elephants."
"You are so cute, and smart, and awesome."
Why you gotta be pregnant for 22 months?
That's crazy.
"Yes, the older cousin is laughing again"
"Guffaw...ehg la verga... shouts - So, get to it! echo"
Birdcalls
S:
I'm here with Dr. Agus who is a professor of engineering and medicine here at USC.
We're looking at pictures of things that seem very different to me.
What is the commonality?
Dr:
The commonality is inflammation.
"Inflammation can be manifested by a runny nose or the flu, it could be manifested by an infection in your toes, it could be hitting your head playing football, or hitting your arm when you fall while playing a sport"
All of those can cause inflammation.
S:
Inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language:
It means something is swollen and red.
But here we're talking about inflammation in the medical or scientific sense where it's not things are swollen and red BECAUSE of inflammation.
Dr:
Right.
S:
So what is inflammation?
It isn't just swollen and redness.
Football players get red and swollen.
Dr:
Inflammation occurs when your body senses danger.
"So when something is wrong--whether it be infection, whether it be trauma--in the case of football players your body senses danger and sends in its front-line soldiers which are its immune cells in order to fight whatever is causing it."
"So, if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that is damaged."
"If it's bacteria, they go in there and try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu."
"So, that whole process is what we call inflammation, it's the ""danger process""."
S:
So the immune cells go to the site of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath of the danger.
That sounds like a good thing!
Dr:
It's an awesome thing.
In order to keep all of this running smoothly it's important to establish the clear roles and responsibilities for maintenance of the shared drives.
That brings me to the end of the presentation.
I just want to say thank you.
Paulette Murray:
It looks like you answered any questions people might have had.
Did you want to say anything else before we close out?
Beth Cron:
"No, just thank you for attending today and I'd like to hear any comments or questions that you have."
Paulette Murray:
Okay.
Thank you so much Beth.
You did a wonderful job.
I think a lot of people appreciate it.
Looks like you have some applause coming from the crowd.
Actually we do have a question from Walter before we do that.
"""How many files / bytes did the NARA project take on?"" Good question Walter."
Beth Cron:
Yes that is a good question.
"Off the top, I know there are several shared drives at NARA."
"A couple terabytes, I think, each."
I don't have the exact numbers.
But they were getting quite large.
Hence the need for a cleanup project.
I can answer any questions about the shared drive bulletin.
"But if you do have specific questions, it's best to talk with your NARA appraisal archivist, who is more familiar with your agency and can better answer any specific questions you might have."
Paulette Murray:
"Alright, once again thank you Beth for a great presentation."
Thank you to everyone who had questions or participated in the discussion.
"We'll be hosting other upcoming online briefings, so please keep your ears out for the fliers that we send out so that you can register for those."
And please look for updates about other online things we're offering here at NARA.
"We have the new fiscal year 13 online course schedule online, I believe."
I will put that link into the chat box after I'm done.
"It was nice, thank you."
The Inclusive Design Research Centre is focused  on designing for diversity.
"We try to design with, rather than designing for."
We believe that we will have greater designs for diversity and more innovative designs when there are multiple perspectives.
Our research is intended to help everyone.
A 3D printer is a printer that prints stuff - physical stuff.
It will enable everyone to basically have the equivalent of a little factory in their own home.
"Well, my name is Judith Snow."
"It's not really so much how the Institute has helped me, as it is I'm a participant."
Inclusion brings out a lot of value in society.
"This place is all about the structures of that, making inclusion actually work, so nobody's left behind."
Ontario is probably one of the most diverse communities in the world.
We are a world leader in things like accessibility legislation.
"What we're creating here is potentially an economic driver for Ontario, so that the world can come here to receive innovative solutions for designing for diversity, or for digital inclusion."
"I went to Eton, paid a lot for knowledge"
I joined the Bullingdon at Brasenose College that's where I caught his eye
He told me that his dad was loaded
"I said, 'Mine too, we should run this country!'"
"He said, 'Yah.'"
"And in 30 seconds time, I realised"
I'll need the votes of common people
I must pretend to do the things that common people do
Then I'll shit on the common people
Then I'll shit on common people like you
What else would I do?
I'm a Tory.
That's what we do
So I became MP for Witney
"It was an easy seat, I had to start it somewhere"
So I started there
I met some people who had no money
"I laughed and laughed, and said, 'Ha!"
"Convicted, that's correct."
JG:
"You write in the preface,"
"""It had been and is my view that it was the racism in Middlesex County, fueled by biased, inflammatory publicity in the local press before and throughout the trial, fanned by the documented government lawlessness, that made it possible for the white jury to convict Assata on the uncorroborated, contradictory, and generally incredible testimony of trooper Harper, the only other witness to the events on the turnpike."""
"There was one other state trooper, Harper, who survived the confrontation and who was the main witness against Assata."
LH:
"Yeah, but Harper ran away during the shootout, came back, and his story was conflicted and contradictory."
And—
"Yeah, it all comes down to tapping buttons."
Which brings us to our next accessory.
Probably the stupidest thing ever invented: the Speedboard.
What is it?
It's a piece of fucking plastic!
You attach your controller.
You get it?
In case you don't want to hold the controller with your hands?
"In case you enjoy playing on the floor, or behind a table?"
Then this is for you.
It's embarrassing.
What's the point?
To put the speed at your fingers?
Why in the ass would I need that?
"If I'm playing a game that involves having to tap the buttons like crazy,"
"I'm probably gonna get a turbo controller,"
like the NES Max or NES Advantage.
How could they even sell such a thing?
"Even though it's made by a third-party company, it was actually licensed by Nintendo."
It's like covering a turd in ice cream sprinkles.
"Next up, oh boy, the Konami LaserScope."
Now I just wanna go on record by saying I fuckin' love Konami.
But this thing reeks of ass!
"It's essentially yet another form of the Zapper, but it's voice-controlled."
Classic New England clam chowder.
Five ingredients...
"Potatoes, cream, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;onion, pork, clams.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All of those things at the end of the day, they sound easy, and that's &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what makes it a hard dish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"To me, the most intimidating dish is the one I'm well-known for. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a work of art.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
You seriously have to follow every step religiously.
Any idea?
Your notorious beef Wellington?
It's exactly that.
"It scares the hell out of me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's so intimidating,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;it takes years&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of practice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Felix, out of Joe, Graham,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and my dish,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what dish are you gonna choose?"
I choose...
The theme of today's elimination test is our most intimidating dishes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We gave Felix&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the choice of one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that give us the most anxiety.
The dish that Felix chose was...
A stunning risotto.
All right.
"My whole stomach sinks, and I feel a little nauseous, because I've only made risotto once in my life, and it was not very good."
"Risotto's not intimidating to me because I've made it before, and I'm comfortable doing it in a short period of time."
- Felix.
- Yes.
"For winning the mystery box challenge, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- you don't have to cook it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Yeah! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You're safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Go enjoy your safety &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;up in our gallery.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Applause]
Thank you.
What an amazing position to be in.
"At least one of you will be eliminated &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the back of this risotto,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; so make sure it's not you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;All of you&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have got 45 minutes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to make a stunning risotto. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your 45 minutes starts from...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Now.
Off you go.
"(Announcer) As Felix enjoys the safety of the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; lounge, the remaining home cooks must now choose the necessary ingredients to make one stunning risotto dish."
Butter.
I need butter.
"(Announcer) At the end of the challenge, at least one more person will be sent home."
Is there butter in here?
Seo Jen (Jean) Lee:
I really enjoyed to be Support Leader.
It was great to have responsibility of taking care of Year 7s and be as a leader.
I loved it.
[Mitt Romney]
I'm not gonna let this battle be dictated by facts
I'm rich!
I've got fat stacks and super PACs
We all know what went down in that 2008 election
You're a decent politician with a winning complexion
"You're all Barack and no bite, been no change and we're all still hoping"
"That you'll shut your mouth, but like Guantanamo Bay they're both open"
"You're from the windy city, where you're looking pretty with your blowhards"
"But come January, you'll be left evicted and with no job"
Raw rhymes stronger than my jawline when I spit a phrase
Knocking you harder than front doors in my old mission days
"You see this silver spoon, this dug Mass out of debt"
It took you four years to drop unemployment down below 8%
You feel that Barry?
"You're old news, everyone's having doubts"
And your rhymes are as weak as this economy that you've done nothing about
Call me a vicious business man cause Romney's stealing this race
"I'll go Bain Capital on your donkey ass, restructure your face!"
[Barack Obama]
"They say your father was a great man, you must be what's left"
"Need to stop hatin' on gays, let 'em teach you how to dress"
"You've got the momma jeans, and a Mister Fantastic face"
So rich and white it's like I'm running against a cheesecake!
Republicans need a puppet and you fit
"Got their hands so far up your rear, call you Mitt!"
"I'm the head of state, you're like a head of cabbage"
'Bout to get smacked by my stimulus package
That appeal attracts people all over the world.
Economic growth in Asia is due to millions of families wanting to give their children a better life.
"The TV series ""Home to the Village"" shows the cruelty of urbanization."
It's not fun to move from a rural community to a tenement house.
In China rice growers get silicosis working in stone processing plants.
"Becoming an industrial worker is not a beautiful thing, you'll agree."
We build dams that flood valleys.
But what is the alternative?
"It's living in the countryside and having six kids, of whom two die."
"The population doubles in a generation, there's war and misery."
But the path of development that's available is not pretty.
And of course we have the impending climate threat.
The US ambassador made a statement in a Swedish national paper that:
"""The climate issue cannot be solved without regulating India and China."""
Scandalous!
He's crazy.
"China emits 3 tons of CO2 per capita, the US 21 tons."
He shouldn't talk until the US cuts emissions to 10 tons per capita.
The United States needs to halve its energy consumption.
Where does your great dedication come from?
It's really fun to work with what I do.
My interest in the world developed into curiosity as to why this shouldn't work.
Why is Malaysia free from malaria?
"Why does Singapore, a tropical marsh on the equator have the world's best health?"
They did welfare investments.
"They had children's health centers, got rid of drugs..."
They created good social development.
People tend to say I paint the world in excessively rosy colors.
But I don't.
Ten million children die each year in the world.
But you have to see the improvements even if huge problems remain.
You have to see the risk of climate change and still say that not many people are dying of it yet.
"I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification."
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
"You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow."
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
(Laughter)
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
"You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic."
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
"A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens."
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
(Laughter)
"A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,"
"Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms."
"And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail."
But rats have incredible survival skills.
They can chew through cinder blocks... squeeze through spaces the size of a quarter... survive a fall of 50 feet... swim over a mile... and tread water for three days.
"One pair can potentially produce 15,000 descendants a year!"
Rats don't have many friends... possibly because they go where we go.
Rats are bad for the health.
"In the last 1,000 years, diseases carried by rats have killed more people than all of the world's wars and revolutions combined."
And there's every chance rats will survive
long after we've been wiped off the face of the planet.
Nuclear holocaust.
But rats can survive.
Eniwetok Atoll.
A string of tiny islands in the Pacific Ocean.
It was a tropical paradise for rats.
Until the U.S. military arrived.
"Between 1946 and 1958, 40 nuclear bombs were detonated on Eniwetok Atoll."
The largest explosion carved a mile-wide crater in the coral reef.
MAN:
It is now 30 seconds to zero time.
Put on goggles or turn away.
"Minus ten seconds, niner, eight, seven, six, fiver, four, three, two, one, T zero."
NARRATOR:
The destructive power of the test was roughly 800 times larger than the explosion in Hiroshima.
It seemed the island was wiped clean of life...
but not of rats.
"Shielded from the blast inside cable tunnels or under concrete, they emerged into the apocalypse."
"Two years later, scientists found the rat population had not only survived... but thrived."
They'd scavenged food on the beach and supplemented their diet with a little cannibalism.
"The rats appear healthy, normal animals."
But nobody's quite sure what mutations may have been caused by exposure to so much radiation.
All life needs water.
Southern Africa is ravaged by droughts.
Most fish die.
"They have free weights, they have machines."
The exercise machines are awesome.
I'm involved in the U.R.I. marching band.
I definitely love being at the football games and really channeling the school spirit.
You have the football team here.
The games are so much fun to go to.
Alot of students get into it.
We have a real close team.
The basketball is great.
My favorite sport is college basketball.
Lots of great rivalries.
You kind of just really get into it because everyones energy is high.
It really gives me that sense of school spirit.
I really feel like I've
learned alot and gotten alot of life lessons from all of the activities outside of my classes sometimes.
You're gonna gain a really great education.
"I think it's a really great option, especially financially."
They really focus on making sure that you get the bang for your buck.
I feel like I'm getting a good deal.
Get the most out of your college career because it goes by quick.
The education I'm getting here is great.
They prepare us well for the real world.
"Wow, I really have gotten alot out of the University."
I love U.R.I.
"For this question, we do a little recap of our packet protocol."
If we look at this wave form here you have the clock at the top.
"We have the valid signals that says, we are transmitting data."
"And then, the valid signal goes low the"
last cycle of the packet we are sending out a parity.
"In the second packet here, packet 2, you can see that while we're transmitting a packet, we can suspend that packet by asserting the suspensd signal."
"And therefore, the data transmissions will be delayed and the packet will not transmit until the suspensd signal goes again low."
This is a waveform.

"Well, let's go write out the answer together in the interpreter."
"I'm going to start by defining my function small_words, and it takes a list of words as input."
I definitely want to iterate over each one.
"The problem definition said that we want those involving at most 3 letters, so those are the small words that we yield."
Now I'm going to add some debugging to see if I've gotten the right answer.
I'm going to use one of these list comprehensions because I love them so much.
"Finite State Machines, adding a lexer that follows them automatically,"
"Context Free grammars, parsing, having a parser thet flow through automatically."

Academic research can be deceptively difficult.
"Sure, there's a lot to be found on the internet, but how do you know which sources to trust?"
How do you find the specific information you need?
"And once you have your information, how do you go about starting your project?"
The Sheridan Library can help eliminate some of the guesswork.
The library has more resources than you may realize to help you with your research.
"We have books to inform and inspire, or, put you at center stage."
"We have periodicals to keep you on top of what's happening now,"
and databases to put you on the leading edge;
"Videos to help bring information to life,"
"or, to help you breathe life into what you imagine;"
"quiet rooms where you can compose your thoughts,"
and friendly staff to help navigate it all.
"Of course, we can't guarantee you an A, but we can help you find the resources you need to succeed."
"Contact us through the web chat on the library website, by e-mail, by phone, or, simply come in yourself."
We're here to help.

Hi!
So this week we are discussing women and comedy.
"And you'd probably be forgiven for thinking that there aren't that many women in the comedy scene,"
Man:
"But that's just because women are biologically more funny than women, everyone knows that..."
(Voice effects)
(Music)
Like this.

"So, loosely defined, that is what's possible with the human voice."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
(Applause)
Could you answer some questions about the socia webs?
"Yes,of course"
Where are you from?
I'm from Holland.
Does technology influences your daily life?
"If, in everything that surrounds me."
Do you think that technology is important to survive or could you live without it?
"Not survive without it, it has become a necessity."
What kind of technology do you use?
"Mobile phone, tablet, gaming consoles, computer, and music player etc."
Do you dependent on some technology?
"If, to communicate with other people"
Do you know use social networks?
"Yes, are very simple to use"
How do you think the world has changed thanks to technology ?
"Technology has completely changed the way of life of the people, how they work, how they speak, and its needs changed."
Is all thanks for your time.
"Ellen Langer, as we move increasingly towards an information society away from muscle power increasingly to brain power, how to think how to learn."
"Yet, you've introduced the concept of ""mindfulness"" that really challenges what is the most effective way of learning."
"Walk us through what the basic principles of what ""mindfulness"" are."
"I think the best way to understand it is to realize that all that we've learned and the way that we've learned how to learn teach us to search for ""certainty."""
Because then you think you know it.
"Uh huh -- but ""certainty"" leads to ""mindlessness."""
"That once you know something so well, that you don't have to look at it again, you don't know it all... because things are constantly changing."
"And essentially mindfulness is the act of drawing the distinctions, noticing the novelty."
That's just people trying to increase available calories.
But one revolution leads to another.
"And pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see."
"Many historian also argue that without agriculture we wouldn't have the bad things that come with complex civilization, like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine."
"And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser."
"Without it, humans would never have changed the environment so much, building dams, and clearing forests, and more recently drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer."
"Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean that that was the right choice?"
"Maybe so, and maybe not."
"But regardless, we can't unmake that choice."
And that's one of the reasons why I think it is so important to study history.
"History reminds us that revolutions are not event, so much as they are processes."
"That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today."
"Just as today we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people in the future will remember as revolutions."

"Now, you guys all work for organizations with, with a, with a few exceptions for which this sort of thing should be happening."
How many of you are aware of what management has specified as being the risk tolerance of your organization?
Not even one?
[LAUGH]
Okay.
"So, I mean, that's, that's kind of scary."
That's kind of scary.
"Cuz if you don't know what the risk tolerance is, how can you put a framework in place, that's going to achieve managements expectations?"

This video gives a live demonstration of the recursive constructs in sequel that we introduced in the previous video.
"As a reminder, recursion has been introduced intosequal as part of the with statement where we can set up relations that are defined by queries that themselves refer to the relation being defined, and finally we have a query that can involve the recursively defined relations as well as other relations or other tables in the database."
The typical expression within a with statement for a recursively defined relation would be to have a base query that doesn't depend on R and then a recursive query that does depend on R. We gave three examples in the introductory video and those are the same examples that we'll be demonstrated shortly.
The first one was to compute ancestors when we have only a parent relation and the family tree could be arbitrarily deep.

These URLs are eligible for the feature because they come in key value pairs or name value pairs.
"What it looks like is ""key equals value"" and then perhaps an ampersand."
"And then ""key two equals value two."" And Google, when we see these parameters will treat this URL as equivalent to this URL."
Because the ordering in the parameters doesn't matter.
URLs that are ineligible for this feature are those that don't use the key value configuration.
So if a site uses a bunch of plus signs to separate their parameters.
Or they just use a directory structure.
Or they use their own type of encoding.
None of these types of URLs can actually be used.
Because this feature requires the name value pairs.
Alright.
I know that was a long intro.
But now let's get started with the feature.
Step one is to specify parameters that don't change the page's content.
"So you can ask yourself,"
"""Do I have parameters that don't affect page content?"" Things like a session ID."
An affiliate
ID.
Or a tracking ID.
These types of parameters don't change page content.
"And so in the feature, you can actually mark them as ""does not change content."" And once you've said that, Webmaster"
Tools will put one representative URL as the setting.
And then Googlebot will act accordingly.
"Once step one is completed for all the parameters that don't actually change page-content, then"
let's move on to step two.
Which comes in two parts.
The first part is to specify the parameters that change page content.
So you'll select.
"""Yes, this changes, reorders, or ""narrows"" page content."" And then you can have a type of page content effect."
"Whether that sorts,"
"""narrows"", specifies, etcetera."
And we'll cover more of this in depth.
I'm not sure what I've seen.

"Now, I'd like to ask you about what happens as the number of flips or events, in general, becomes a very large number."
Check all that apply.
The probability of every individual sequence becomes small
The probability of every number of heads becomes small.
"So for example, does the probability of having one head or hundred heads or million heads, any specific number does that becomes small."
"Does the probability of every given proportion, for example, one head out of 100 flips, 10 heads out of 100 flips or 1500 heads out of a billion flips becomes small."
Does every given range of proportions have a smaller and smaller probability.
Are there some ranges of proportions for which the probability becomes small as we have many flips.
Check all that apply.
"Also, assume that the probability of heads is neither 0 or 1."
"That is, we can get both heads and tails from this coin."

How to make giant soap bubbles
"We prepare a mixture of water, Marseilles soap, paper glue, sugar and a little of glycerine."
"This mixture is poured into a flat bottom container, where we dip a hoop and then lift it."
"Better than any comment, the video shows the successful development of the experiment in front of a young audience."
"The soap and sugar in the mixture has reduced the surface tension of water, which allows to create thin films of a huge surface and that can last long."

"(Announcer) In this risotto elimination challenge, many are struggling."
"Oh, my God."
"(Announcer) At the end of tonight, another one of these 17 home cooks will be leaving the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Taste.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Start thinking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about the execution.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Everything.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; 60 seconds to go."
Come on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Check the plate.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let the risotto relax.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Seasoning.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Butter in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Cheese in.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You want rich lava.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Ten, nine, eight, seven, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;six, five,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;four, three, two, one,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; and stop. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Everybody.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
[Cheers and applause]
Well done.
"And the sad news. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tonight, somebody&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;will be leaving&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen."
(Announcer) The judges will taste each risotto dish.
"Then the three worst dishes will be singled out, and one of those home cooks will leave the competition."
"Okay, let's start off back row."
Monti.
I'm a little freaked out right now.
But I'm not going home.
"I came here to cook, and I came here to win this."
"This is risotto made with white wine and chicken stock with a pancetta, pine nuts, sundried tomato, and white asparagus."
"It does not look like a risotto, does it?"
Uh...
They don't look like that ever. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So there's the risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;down there.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I've got to dig for this one.
The pancetta is crispy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That's the nice thing&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;about it.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Unfortunately, your garnish tastes better than the actual body of the risotto."
Have you ever eaten risotto before?
- No.
- That's bizarre.
That I've never eaten risotto?
How are you holding up?
I'm doing all right.
"The thing is, as whoever you're cooking it for is getting the bite, they should get &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a tiny, little piece&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of asparagus,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; a little pancetta, all those things, not huge long pieces that don't really fit on the fork and are just garnished on the top. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Thank you, Monti.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"The judges, they expect us to be at a certain level, and I was far below that level."
[Sniffles]
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.
The psychiatrist you wanted is tied up in another trial.
And the neurologist is sailing to Costa Rica.
"This book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist."
"It's about contemporary cases of possession, mostly in the Third World."
People there are still primitive and superstitious.
Maybe.
Maybe they see possession for what it really is.
Maybe we've taught ourselves not to see it.
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.
Maybe we shouldn't just try to invalidate the prosecution's case... ...by punching holes in the medical approach.
Maybe we should also try to validate the alternative.
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.
Okay.
I guess we could bring in some priests to talk about exorcisms...
"No, the archdiocese won't let us do that."
They wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
She approaches the subject of possession... ...from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.
Keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
But send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner... ...and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore."
"Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered... ...from a serious medical condition... ...that required medical treatment, nothing more."
"He has asserted that any attempt by my client... ...to help Emily by anything other than medical means... ...was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent."
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind... ...to what our evidence and testimony will show.
Medical treatment was not the answer for Emily... ...because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
She was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
"little thing that says, I would say, dude that is totally singular."
Just so you know.
Don't like be messing around doing back slash with that matrix.
Okay.
All right.
That's it for today.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Maile Ohye:
Hi.
I'm Maile Ohye.
I'm a member of Google's webmaster support team.
And I'd
like to help you better understand how to use the URL parameters feature in webmaster tools.
URL parameters is a fairly advanced feature.
So some of this information might be more complex than one would expect.
"Before you further watch this video, please check out the URL parameters page to see if you have a message from Google explaining that we already believe we have high crawl-coverage of your site."
And therefore no adjustments to this feature are necessary.
"The message would say ""Currently Googlebot isn't experiencing problems with coverage of your site."
So you don't need to configure URL parameters.
Incorrectly configuring parameters can result in pages from your site being dropped from our index.
"So we don't recommend you use this tool unless necessary."""
"For those of you who have that message, you're good to go."
And no further viewing is even necessary.
But for those of you who don't have that message please keep watching.
And one of the main takeaways is that improper actions on the URL parameters feature can result in pages no longer appearing in search.
"Again, it's an advanced feature."
The settings in the URL parameters are used by Google as a helpful hint in our crawling process.
"For stronger directives, you want to use things like a robots.txt disallow."
Or a meta noindex.
But using the URL parameters hint is still very helpful.
"In 2010, the Google store only sold about 160 products."
And that seems fine and fairly easy to crawl.
"But the thing is, that of these 160-ish products, it actually created 380,000"
There were two standout risottos. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The first one belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Frank. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Great job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, there was one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that stood out head and shoulders above its competition."
That dish belongs to...
David Martinez.
Both of you will become team captains in the next stage of this competition.
But you know this elimination challenge comes with a departure. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;There were three dishes&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;that stood out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; all for the wrong reasons. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And at least one&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of those three&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;have cooked&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; their last dish in this competition.
"The first dish that was out of character, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bland, subpar,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and on the verge&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of an embarrassment,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; that dish belongs to..."
"Dave Mack. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Come down here, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Please stand over there.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;This next dish&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; had very bizarre flavors and techniques.
Helene.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;That dish belongs to...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"I was trying to not lose my grip on my countertop, because I know I'm gonna be in the bottom three."
I know it.
"The third of the worst dishes had a mix of ingredients that made no sense, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;didn't even seem to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what a risotto was supposed to be."
That dish...
Belongs to Tali. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Gordon)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Those three risottos&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; were embarrassing. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Who will be sent home?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"I did what the challenge asked for, you know, so I feel safe."
I screwed up.
My risotto was undercooked.
"I'm feeling, quite frankly, scared."
My food tastes great.
What do the judges want?
Why didn't they see it on my plate?
"Dave Mack, one step forward, please. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You can't turn out&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;undercooked rice&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; with every mouthful just full of grit."
"Dave, you are not safe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stay there, please.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Helene.
Your dish was really bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We were bitterly disappointed.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
But it wasn't one of the worst two.
"Back to your station, please."
Thank you.
Thank you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dr:
Yes.
S:
Fascinating.
"The people who are dying of heart disease, is it the cholesterol that's killing them or the inflammation?"
Dr:
I think it's a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon where the inflammation allows the cholesterol to deposit; and they go together.
S:
"It's really the statins affect inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation."
Dr:
Exactly.
One of the problems we have in Biology and Medicine is what you can measure.
"So, I can measure cholesterol."
I don't really know how to measure inflammation well.
"So while we can make these associations in big studies where we look back, if I had a metric, a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I could optimize this."
S:
Can you not just measure the amount of cytokines or other inflammatory types of things?
Dr:
There are different types of inflammation.
"So, some inflammation can be good, some can be bad."
"Some can be really causal, some can be a little causal."
"So we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation, the key is to start to tease them out, and be able to modulate them."
"You can develop a drug, but then you would have to optimize it for a particular purpose."
"So, these were optimized to lower cholesterol."
They do that very well.
"It also lowers inflammation, and they work beautifully in that regard."
But how do we optimize that going forward?
"It also means that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation."
"So, what are the easy ways to do that?"
"One is, which I think should be mandatory, is things like the flu shot."
"So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent you from having a bad flu..."

Welcome to the archeology news!
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we'll travel in time to shed light on an interesting event of past human history."
We'll use a biological time machine: cattle DNA.
The DNA is the code of life.
It contains all the information needed for the correct functioning of living organisms.
"Geneticists represent it as an alphabet, with four letters."
"They are chemical basis, represented as letters."
"These letters and the associated code are transmitted from parents to progeny, across generations."
The DNA duplication machinery is not error free.
Letters may be mistyped and errors transmitted to progeny.
These mutations create the genetic variation that is at the row material shaped by evolution and speciation.
A multi pronged strategy will be most effective:
1.
BOYCOTT:
"All corporate products, beginning with Coke, McDonalds, ADM, and Monsanto."
Reduce to eliminate your consumption of gasoline.
You can start this now.
Lawsuits:
"The more of their resources are devoted to circular legal action, which is expensive, the more is taken out of their budget without producing anything."
"File lawsuits of every kind (class action, environmental damage, labor rights)."
2.
STRlKE:
The first week of July 2011.
"Take your vacation time, sick leave, organize your union to strike at this time."
Spend time with family at home!
The main thing is:
DON'T BUY ANYTHlNG FOR ONE WEEK.
"Continue as long as possible, buy the gasoline you will need for a week at least."
"Where legally possible if you rent, organize a rent strike in your building/community."
3.
PREPARE:
"Learn what wild foods are available to you, identify them, and eat them."
"Start a garden, organize within your community to become as food self sufficient as possible."
Store durable food a little at a time so you have a large supply by July.

"In the last June 30, numbers of Egyptians went down on the streets of cairo and other cities to protest against the first elected Egyptian president Morsi"
The army interfered and did a coup against Morsi depending claiming that its decision was a respond to the call of the huge number of protesters on the street as army claimed and their numbers varied
Army used a military chopper to take footage for the protests and market it to the media and the world
And the number of the against President Morsi protesters were like stock market exchange
The numbers race (variations) posed mathematical questions before being political
Some used Google Earth to investigate
"Out of the ordinary, Google made a statement to deny all these claims"
"Wael Fakharany, the regional manager of Google said"
"""All the statistics that were cited to Google about the protest in june, 30th or pro president Morsi are fake"" without going into too much mis-claims about the number of protesters"
"Analysts, specialists and some western media websites tried to use the technology of Google Earth"
"Not to count numbers but to measure the area, hence the capacity of the streets and squares to carry the protesters"
"They found that the space of Tahrir square is at most 53,000 square meters"

"I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more"
"They want Shady,"
I'm chopped liver
"Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya"
A little bit of me mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin the table while he's operating hey!!
"You waited this long, now stop debating"
"Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu-lating"
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney but your husband's heart problem's complicating
"So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me, so let me see"
They try to shut me down on MTV
"But it feels so empty, without me"
"So, come on and dip, bum on your lips jump back jiggle the hips and wiggle a bit"
"And get ready, cause this is about to get heavy"
"I just settled all my lawsuits,"

Now this looks like a job for me
"So everybody , just follow me"
"Cause we need a little, controversy"
"Cause it feels so empty, without me"

No more austerity!
That was the demand from unions in Brussels a day before EU leaders are due to gather in the city for a summit which will be crowned with a new fiscal treaty.
"The pact's aim is to control deficits in the bloc, but as in other parts of Europe which also saw protest action, demonstrators called for a new strategy."
"""Come up with another policy, your policy of austerity isn't working and is creating a gulf between citizens and you the leaders of Europe."" said one protester."
"""Greece is in the red."
"But Swiss banks hold Greek assets which are worth three times more than that country's public debt, so there is a way of finding the money without workers having to pay,"" said another women at the rally which was held in front of the EU Commission."
"Reporting from the protest euronews"" Gülsüm Alan said:"
"""As anti-austerity rallies take place across Europe, EU leaders are getting ready to sign on new fiscal treaty here in Brussels this Friday."
"Instead of solving the bloc's problems Unions believe it will only plunge Europe into a deeper recession."""

"Cassatt has so much in common with her impressionist colleagues and is really picking up on some of the most advanced problems that they were confronting in their art, an interest in artificial light, for example."
The informality of loose brushwork of an attempt to capture a moment in time.
These are all concerns that were important to her impressionist colleagues.
Steven:
One of the areas that I found most interesting is the place where her shoulders meet.
"The representation of her shoulders and the representation of the reflection of her shoulders, and all of that comes together just at the top of the upholstered chair that she sits on, and if you work out from that point, the arc of the balcony that we see reflected in the mirror becomes a reference to her vision, as she looks out at the audience, even as it looks back to her."

Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in you smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night
We've been together
"Lovers at first sight, in love forever"
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
[Instrumental]
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Battle of Anzio
"The Battle of Anzio, which is also called Operation Shingle (January 22, 1944) was an Allied sea landing in the Italian Campaign against German forces of Anzio and Nettuno, Italy."
The attack was commanded by American Major General John P. Lucas. He wanted to get around German forces on the Winter Line. Then he wanted to attack Rome. Making a sea landing in a marshland needed to be done quickly.
The landing surprised the Germans. The Allies even got near Rome. The Allies got their men ready on the beach. The German commander in the Put his guns around the beach. The Germans also flooded the marsh with salt water.
"After a month of heavy fighting,"
the Allies finally got past the beaches in May. The Allies went north-west to Rome which was captured on 4 June.
The German Tenth Army at Cassino were able to go north of Rome. Then they got ready to defend the Gothic Line.
Background.
"At the end of 1943, following the Allied invasion of Italy, Allied forces were stuck at the Gustav Line. Thid was defensive line across Italy. The land of central Italy helped the defence."
Operation Shingle was planned by Winston Churchill in December 1943. He planned to land two divisions at Anzio and capture Rome.
"General Harold Alexander had thought of a plan using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have enough troops or a way to transport them."
"The Anzio and Nettuno beaches are on marshland. When Truscott's 3rd Division was selected for the attack, he said everyone would die. Lucas was told lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a landing in the Anzio/Nettuno area."
Plan.
"Planners thought that if German forces left the Gustav Line to defend against the Allied attack, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line. If troops were left on the Gustav Line, then the Allies could try to capture Rome."
"The Allies planned to attack from the south. They wanted to capture a beach near Anzio, move forward, and be ready to go to Rome."
Availability of naval forces.
One of the problems with the plan was there was mot enough landing ships.
"Only enough tank landing ships (LSTs) to land a single division were available. Later, Churchill made sure enough were available to land two divisions."

Graham's number
Graham's number is a very big natural number that was defined by a man named Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
"Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number were written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe."
Context.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
"It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is ""yes"" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or fewer, we can color the lines so that the answer is ""no""."
"By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ""n"" is the answer ""no"" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ""n"" is it ""yes"" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet."
"In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ""n""=6, the answer is ""no"". But when ""n"" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is ""yes""."
"One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually ""yes"" for at least some large ""n"". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much."
"There is a much smaller limit for the same problem called N. It is equal to formula_1, where formula_2. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November 1977."
Definition.
"Graham's number is not only too big to write down all of its digits, it is too big even to write in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation."
"We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used in an equation to find the next. g64 is Graham's number."
"First, here are some examples of up-arrows:"
"After that, g2 is equal to formula_18; the number of arrows in this number is g1."
"g3 is equal to formula_19, where the number of arrows is g2."
"We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_19, where the number of arrows is g63."
This is Graham's number.

In the gun battle, four policemen and fourteen marchers were killed. Many more were wounded, including Hermann Göring."
Nazi memorial.
"After the Nazis took power in 1933, Hitler turned the Feldherrnhalle into a memorial to the Nazis killed there. A memorial to the killed men was put up on its east side. It is opposite the location of the shootings. This monument was called the ""Mahnmal der Bewegung"". It was designed by Paul Ludwig Troost. The square in front of the Feldherrnhalle (the Odeonsplatz) was used for SS parades and rallies. New SS recruits took their oath of loyalty to Hitler in front of the memorial."
After the war.
"At the end of the war, the Feldherrnhalle was changed back to how it was earlier. Local people smashed the ""Mahnmal der Bewegung"" to pieces on 3 June 1945. In the 1950s, a plan to move Bavaria's memorial to the unknown soldier to the Feldherrnhalle was ended. There was concerns that neo-Nazis would meet at the site."

Background.
Allies.
"The plan for Operation ""Husky"" called for the sea attack of the island by two armies. One would land on the South Eastern coast. Another would land on the central Southern Coast. The attack would be helped by naval gunfire and bombing. The commander was the American General Dwight D. Eisenhower."
"The Allied land forces were from the American, British and Canadian armies. They were put into two groups. The Eastern Task Force was led by General Bernard Montgomery. The Western Task Force was commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton. In addition to the sea landings, airborne troops were to be flown in. They would capture bridges and high ground."
The Allied naval forces were put into two groups to transport the invading armies.
"The island was defended by the two corps of Italian 6th Army under General Alfredo Guzzoni. In early July the total Axis force in Sicily was about 200,000 Italian and 32,000 German troops, and 30,000 ""Luftwaffe"" ground staff. By late July there were 70,000 German troops."
Planning.

"These stated that the Allies were planning to invade Greece and Sardinia, and had no plans to invade Sicily. The Germans thought the documents were real. The Germans moved much of their defences from Sicily to Greece."
Battle.
Two British and two American attacks by airborne forces were done on the night of 9–10 July. They wanted to capture the bridge over the River Anape. Strong wind made them land in the wrong places. Airborne troops attacked patrols. A platoon captured the bridge and fought off counterattacks for a few hours.
The strong winds made the sea landings hard. Landings were made on 10 July on twenty-six main beaches.
By the evening of 10 July the seven Allied divisions were ashore and the port of Syracuse had been captured.
Alexander's plan was to establish his forces on a line between Licata in and Catania. He wanted to capture ports.

Energy for other kinds of welding.
"OFW uses a flame from burning fuel gas and oxygen to heat up the metal. This fuel gas is almost always acetylene. Acetylene is a flammable gas that burns very hot, hotter than any other gas. That is why it is used most of the time. Other gases like propane, natural gas, or other industrial gases can be used too."
"Some kinds of welding do not use heat to make the weld. These kinds of welding can get hot, but they do not make the metal melt. Forge welding is an example of this. Friction stir welding is a special kind of welding that does not use heat. It uses a very powerful motor and a special spinning bit to mix the metals together at the edge. This seems odd because metals are a solid. this is why it takes a lot of force to do and is very hard. The energy for this kind of welding is mechanical energy from the spinning bit."

Homology (mathematics)
"In mathematics, homology is a certain procedure to associate a sequence of abelian groups or modules with a mathematical object, such as a topological space or a group. The word homology has the Ancient Greek root ""homos"", which means ""identical""."
"For a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces."
"The original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their ""holes"". Since a ""hole"" is defined by something that is ""not there"", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape. As it turns out, there are some kinds of holes that homology cannot ""see"" — in which case homotopy groups may be what is needed."

"To describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud)."
Abnormal Breath Sounds.
There are many kinds of breath sounds that are not normal. These are called adventitious breath sounds. Each different kind of abnormal breath sound is a sign of a different problem. Some of the most common abnormal breath sounds are:

Slices of cucumber, tomato, and lettuce are included for garnishing. Eggs can be either mixed into fried rice in the beginning as scrambled eggs or served separately as fried eggs.

When cooking it, one may put anything that can harmonize with the taste."
"Even though any ingredient can be added in nasi goreng, what cannot be taken out is the ""kecap manis"". ""Kecap manis"" is very crucial in the dish which gives the flavor to the nasi goreng. It is what makes the taste of nasi goreng different from other Asian styles of fried rice. Other sauces such as ""ikan asin"" (salted dried fish) and ""saus tiram"" (oyster sauce) can be added as well. The spiciness of nasi goreng is decided by the amount of ""sambal"" (chilli sauce). The sambal can be added during the cooking process or added individually while eating, depending on the preference."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for about 85% to 90% of lung cancer cases. People who have a deficient low pigment count have a higher chance of contracting lung cancer. There are three types of non-small cell lung cancer:
Symptoms:
"Whitchurch, Shropshire"
"Whitchurch is a small market town in the north of the county of Shropshire, England. It is the oldest town inhabited in Shropshire. The town lies 2 miles (3 km) east of the Welsh border. As of 2011, the town has a population of 9,781."
The town was founded by the Romans and there are still some Roman artefacts that can be visited in a Museum.
Taurus (constellation)
"Taurus is a constellation in the northern sky. ""Taurus"" means ""bull"" in Latin. It is a constellation of the zodiac, which means that it crosses the ecliptic. The astronomer named Ptolemy listed Taurus when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is one of the 88 modern constellations that were made by the International Astronomical Union."
"The star clusters Pleiades and Hyades are in Taurus. Taurus also contains the Crab Nebula, which is a supernova remnant. The brightest star in Taurus is a red giant star called Aldebaran."
The Pink Panther 2
"The Pink Panther 2 is a comedy movie released in 2009. It is the sequel to the movie ""The Pink Panther"". In this movie, Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) is assigned to catch a burglar called ""The Tornado"". The Tornado has stolen the famous Pink Panther Diamond."
"This movie also stars Kevin Kline, Beyoncé Knowles, and Jean Reno."
Boston National Historical Park
"The Boston National Historical Park (est. October 1, 1974) is a group of eight sites in Boston, Massachusetts associated with the American Revolutionary War: the Bunker Hill Monument; Charlestown Navy Yard; Dorchester Heights; Faneuil Hall; Old North Church; Old South Meeting House; Old State House; and the Paul Revere House."
Organolithium reagent
"Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air."
Bieler Braderie
"The Braderie (, ) is a festival celebrated every year in Biel, Switzerland at the end of June. In 2013, the festival will start on 28 June and end on 30 June."
Location.
"The main part of the festival takes place between the train station Biel and the Nidaugasse. There are over 100 stalls every year, which sell different things. The shops in Biel usually do their sales in this week, because many people are in the streets during the festival. A stage is set up in the front of the Apollo Cinema. Bands and singers present their music on this stage. The Braderie is known for a lot of famous Swiss stars, for example, Stress, DJ Antoine and Pegasus."
History.
"The Braderie began in 1936. Since 1930 and the big economic crisis, the people of Biel were searching for a way to improve the economy of Biel. The festival was started by Miggi Tièche and Carlo Schneeberger. The first Braderie was a big success. Originally known simply as a solution for the crisis, the Braderie began to be a part of Biel's calendar. There were three Braderies between 1937 and 1939. During World War II, they had to stop the Braderie. The break ended only in 1947, and then the Braderie started again, and it was known as ""Bieler Sommerfest"" (Biel Summer Celebration). Because of the long history from the Braderie, it is common today for most of the stores in Biel to make their sales during the Braderie."
Alba Quezada
"Alba Quezada (born Alba Pilar Fuenzalida Figueroa on August 28, 1985 in Chillán) is a Chilean model and television presenter."

"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer is a German wine-growing-region in the valleys of the rivers Moselle, Saar and Ruwer near Koblenz and Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its wines of Riesling, Elbling and Müller-Thurgau grapes."
There are the following six sub-regions with 19 large vineyards:
Snail
A snail is a common name for a kind of mollusc. The term is used for a gastropod with a coiled shell. Their fossil records extends back into the Carboniferous period.
"Land snails and slugs breathe with a kind of lung. They used to be put together in a group, the Pulmonata. This was a well-known order in traditional taxonomy. However, the Pulmonata is polyphyletic. This means the same life-style evolved in a number of different lines. This is called convergent evolution. Therefore, the Pulmonata is no longer an official term in biological classification."
"The term ""snail"" is also sometimes used for aquatic snail-like gastropods, which usually have gills. Actually, most snail species are marine snails. There are more species of them, and they are far greater in numbers. Many kinds of snails can also be found in fresh water habitats."
Most land snails and slugs are herbivorous. Aquatic snails and slugs are usually omnivores or predatory carnivores.
"In many countries around the world, people eat snails as a delicacy. In France, snails are called ""escargots"", which is also the name of the dish. In French cuisine, the snails are cooked in salt water and then served with a garlic sauce."
The biggest snail is the giant African snail. Their foot is up to 35 cm long.
"The fastest snail is the ""Helix aspersa"". It can reach speeds up to 0.047 kmh."
There are known more than 43000 species of snails all over the world.
Body parts.
Shell.
"Snails are invertebrates, which are animals with no backbones. The shell on the snail helps protect it, and also reduces the loss of water by evaporation. Shells have many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Snails do not breathe through their mouths, instead they have a breathing hole under their shells."
Foot.
"A snails ""foot"" is a muscle which allows it to move slowly across the ground. The foot puts out ('exudes') slime, which eases the snail's movement, leaving a trail. Snails can absorb mineral nutrients through their foot by simply sitting on a rock."
Head.
The head is attached to the foot. On the head there are 15 mm stalks. At the end of the stalks are snail’s eyes.
Habitat.
"Snails are found all over the world. Generally speaking, land snails live in damp habitats. They live in caves and dark places. Snails can be found in dark places such as in a garden under plant's foliage leaves. Some species live in cold places like the Arctic and a few are found in warm places like beaches and deserts."
Food.
"Land snails eat vegetables and fruits, such as lettuce, carrots, cucumber and apples. Aquatic snails are often carnivorous. Snails use their radula to cut food. The radula is a hard, rough plate in the mouth. Radula teeth are like little pieces of sandpaper. They are good for cutting up plants and if the snail eats meat they are good for tearing the meat apart."
"Many animals eat snails. Fireflies, snakes, beetles, fish, insects, turtles and people eat snails too. To defend themselves, snails pull back into their shells."
Ruwer River
"The Ruwer is a river in Germany with a length of , a tributary of the Mosel River. The valley of the Ruwer is a part of the wine-growing region Mosel-Saar-Ruwer near Trier in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its Riesling wines."
"At the lower Ruwer valley are the villages Waldrach, Kasel, Mertesdorf, Eitelsbach and Ruwer."
Tributaries.
"Tributaries are Alkenbach, Altbach, Altweiherbach, Apfelbach, Avelbach, Bausbach, Benninger Bach, Bingelbach, Burg Heider Bach, Burkelsbach, Eitelsbach, Enterbach, Eschbach, Eselsbach, Flonterbach, Gimpelbach, Gondersbach, Grindelbach, Großbach, Hinzerter Bach, Kittelbach, Klinkbach, Kreidbach, Kundelbach, Labach, Lehbach, Misselbach, Moertschelbach, Mühlscheider Bach, Pehlbach, Rauruwer, Rimperterbach, Riveris, Rothbach, Siebenbornbach, Thielenbach, Waldbach, Waschbach, Weiherbach, Wenigbach, Wenzelbach and Weschbach."

Phase-shift keying
"Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information. This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available."
"If we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific number of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information."
"By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text."
"Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates."
Pritzker Architecture Prize
"The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—""firmitas, utilitas, venustas"" (English: ""durability, utility, and beauty""). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money."
Selection.
"Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring."
Winners.
"The first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was ""for 50 years of imagination and vitality"" shown by the many ""museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures"". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. The most recent winner, in 2019, is Arata Isozaki."
Jejomar Binay
"Jejomar ""Jojo"" Cabauatan Binay (born November 11, 1942), also known as Jojo Binay or VNay, is a Filipino politician. He previously served as the 15th Vice President of the Philippines from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2016. Before he became vice president, he was Mayor of Makati City from 1986 to 1998 and again from 2001 to 2010."
"He ran for President in 2016, but lost to Rodrigo Duterte."

Sister city.
Loudéac is twinned with:
"Buzzards Bay is a popular place for tourism, fishing and boating."
The name was given to this bay by colonists who saw a large bird they called a buzzard near the shores. But it was really an osprey.
Towns on Buzzards Bay were hit hardest by the effects of Hurricane Bob in August 1991.
Narragansett Bay
Narragansett Bay is a coastal body of water next to southern Rhode Island. It is on the north side of the Rhode Island Sound. The bay forms New England's largest estuary.
"There are over 30 islands in the bay. The three largest ones are Aquidneck Island, Conanicut Island and Prudence Island."
"Providence, Rhode Island's capital and largest city, is just to the north of Narragansett Bay. Newport is on the southeast side of the bay."
Camberwell railway station (England)
"Camberwell is a closed railway station in Camberwell, South London, England. It was opened in 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. It closed to passengers in 1916 and closed to all traffic in 1964. In 2018, local campaigners raised a 2,000 signature petition to re-open the station."
Heron Quays DLR station
Heron Quays is a light metro station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Bank to Lewisham Line. It is in the Heron Quays area of Canary Wharf in East London.
The station is on the Isle of Dogs and serves the southern part of the Canary Wharf office complex. It is directly connected to that complex's Jubilee Place underground shopping centre. The station is elevated and is in one of the complex's office towers. It has an Oyster card interchange for the Canary Wharf tube station on London Underground's Jubilee line. Through ticketing is allowed between the two stations.
South Quay DLR station
"South Quay is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station on the Isle of Dogs, London, England. The station is between Crossharbour and Heron Quays stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2. South Quay station is located on the southern shore of the South Dock of the West India Docks. The current station platforms sit astride the channel connecting Millwall Dock to the West India Docks."
History.
"The original South Quay station opened in 1987 in Millwall, and was a standard DLR phase 1 elevated station. It was later extended to permit the use of 2 car trains. The station was constrained by sharp curves at both ends and could not be further extended on its original site. The DLR planned to operate 3 car trains on this line so the station was relocated to a new site over Millwall Dock. The new site is some distance to the east, so the relocated station is partly in Cubitt Town."
Abbey Road DLR station
"Abbey Road DLR station is a Docklands Light Railway station in the West Ham neighbourhood of the London Borough of Newham, in East London, England. It is located on the Stratford International extension of the Docklands Light Railway."
Science to Youth Movement
"Science to Youth Movement (in Bosnian ""Pokret Nauku mladima""), was formerly the Alliance of Young Researchers of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1992."
The first organizers and presidents were professors at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Sciences.
Function.
"The Movement’s activities were organized as networks of local young researchers at the annual festivals of the B&amp;H, and at the federal level of the Former Yugoslavia. The participants, mostly high school students, competed to test their knowledge of natural sciences and mathematical sciences in the freely selected topics. The works were written in the form of graduation/diploma theses. They were then defended to the professors of the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Biotechnical and Biomedical sciences, and the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Three prizes were awarded annually, in the form of books."
"Bi-weekly or monthly summer schools were commonly held in historically notable cities/locations, such as Tjentište, Boračko jezero, Treskavica – Vučja Luka (Wolf Harbour) Jezero (near Jajce) and others."
"Many engaged activists from the Faculty of Sciences received the highest awards of the Movement and the ""People's Technique"" (which can be found by searching the Internet)."
Mills is openly gay.
Mitochondrial Eve
"Mitochondrial Eve is a term from genetics and human evolution. It refers to a woman, whose mitochondrial DNA is a parent of all living humans. To put this more exactly, she is the female most recent common ancestor of all humans alive at present."
How this is decided.
"Rather than use full DNA comparisons, two simpler methods are used:"
This gives haplogroups (a haplogroup is a combination of genes on different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and tend to be inherited together).
The results.
"According to current research, Mitochondrial Eve lived about 200.000 years ago. Most likely she lived in East Africa, when ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species."
"Mitochondrial Eve lived later than ""Homo heidelbergensis"" and the emergence of ""Homo neanderthalensis"", but earlier than the out of Africa migration."
"The dating for 'Eve' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in Africa and spread from there, replacing more ""archaic"" human populations such as Neanderthals. As a result, the latter hypothesis became dominant."
King Ghidorah
"King Ghidorah is a fictional monster who appears in movies from Japan. He first appeared in ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"". Since then, he has appeared in several ""Godzilla"" movies. He is a golden three-headed dragon with no arms, large wings, and two tails. He is the strongest monster in the ""Godzilla"" movies."
Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)
"The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 is a piece of music for the piano. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published in Vienna, Austria by Artaria in 1784. It is the second of a group of three piano sonatas. Mozart probably wrote the group in Salzburg in the summer of 1783. It was then that he brought his wife Constance (Weber) to his hometown to introduce her to his father Leopold. The first sonata in the group is No. 10 in C major, K. 330. The third is No. 12 in F major, K. 332. Mozart numbered this group of sonatas 1 through 3. He spent much time teaching during his early years in Vienna. It is likely that these sonatas were written for his pupils."
"The A major sonata is unique among Mozart's piano sonatas. It does not include a movement in sonata form. The first movement is a lilting theme in 6/8 followed by six variations in A major and A minor. The last variation is in 4/4 time. The second movement is a Menuetto in A major with a contrasting section (called a Trio) in D major. It is written in 3/4 time. The third and final movement is the famous ""Alla Turca"" (Turkish March or Turkish Rondo) in 2/4 time. It is considered one of the finest examples of Viennese Turkish music that was produced in the late 18th century. The rondo's rolled block bass chords suggest the drum rolls of a Turkish Janissary band. In true classical style, the rondo alternates between major and minor keys, and loud and soft dynamics. The piece is a favorite for amateur recitals."
Sandy Dennis
"Sandra Dale ""Sandy"" Dennis (April 27, 1937-March 2, 1992) was an American actress. She received two Tony Awards for acting. She performed mostly in theater and movies. Her most notable movies included ""Sweet November"" (1968), ""The Out-of-Towners"" (1970) and ""The Indian Runner"". Dennis was born in Nebraska. She died of ovarian cancer in Westport, Connecticut."
"Sakai, Osaka"
"is a city in Osaka Prefecture. It has over 800,000 people. It is known for its ancient burial mounds and its cutlery industry."
"And the largest kofun, ""Daisen-kofun"", the imperial tomb of Emperor Nintoku is located."
Nebraska City
Nebraska City is a city in eastern Nebraska. It is southeast of Omaha. The city is near the border of southwestern Iowa and northwestern Missouri. It was incorporated in late 1855.
Necropolis
"A necropolis (city of the dead) is a large cemetery complex. One of the most famous is Giza Necropolis and that in Thebes, Egypt."
"Henry VIII spent a lot of time at a magnificent building named Hampton Court Palace that belonged to his friend, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. After falling out with Wolsey, Henry took the palace for himself. He made the palace far larger, building things such as tennis courts and jousting yards."
Life Starts Now
"Life Starts Now is the third studio album by Canadian rock band, Three Days Grace. It was released on September 22, 2009. The producer of the album was Howard Benson. The album was certified Platinum in Canada and was also certified Gold in the US. The album peaked at #3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and at #2 on the Canadian Albums Chart."

Sindh Qalanders is a field hockey team for the Sindh Province in Pakistan. They play in the Pakistan Hockey Federation.
Amsterdam Museum
The Amsterdam Museum is a museum in Amsterdam. Before 2011 it was called the Amsterdams Historisch Museum. It is in the old orphanage between Kalverstraat and Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal.
History.
"Since 1975, the museum has been in a building that was first built in 1580 as Amsterdam's orphanage."
The museum has paintings and old photographs and a cafe.
Lawrence Bragg
Sir William Lawrence Bragg (31 March 1890 – 1 July 1971) was an Australian-born British physicist and X-ray crystallographer.
"Bragg was always known as Sir Lawrence Bragg, and his father was Sir William Bragg. Lawrence Bragg was educated in Adelaide, Australia and in England. He was awarded the Military Cross in World War I."
"Lawrence Bragg discovered (1912) the Bragg law of X-ray diffraction, the basis of X-ray crystallography. He was joint winner (with his father, Sir William Bragg) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915."
"To date, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest Nobel Laureate. He was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953."
"He was elected an FRS in 1921. He was knighted by George VI in 1941, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society."
Hoverfly
"Hoverflies, sometimes called 'flower flies' or 'syrphid flies', are the insect family Syrphidae. Hoverflies mimic wasp stripes, and are usually smaller than wasps. Thus to a bird they may look scarcely worth eating, and dangerous."
"As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers. The adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods."
"In some species, the larvae are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects."
"Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year. Hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests, and can be used in biological control. Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators. Some orchids mimic aphid alarm scent (pheromones), which attracts hoverflies. The hoverflies then pollinate the orchids."
"About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except Antarctica."
"Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps. They are a classic example of Batesian mimicry. The Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing: it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. Hover flies look roughly like little wasps, and their warning colouration is well-known to birds."
"Unlike adults, the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. Predatory species benefit farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops. Hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control."
Atomkraft
"Atomkraft are an English heavy metal band who were part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. They formed in 1979 and disbanded 1988. Their ""Total Metal"" approach is somewhere between fellow NWOBHM bands such as Motörhead and Venom, punk rock bands such as The Dickies, and early Exodus or Slayer."
Sounds.
"The Waray language has sixteen consonants: . There are three main vowels: ""a"" , ""i"" , and ""u"" . Consonants and were once allophone but cannot interchange, like ""palaron"" (to be lucky) [from ""palad"", palm (because someone's luck is seen in the palm)] but not ""paladon"" and ""tagadiín"" (from where) [from ""diín"", where] but not ""tagariín""."
Numbers.
"Native numbers are used for numbers one through ten. From eleven onwards, Spanish numbers are exclusively used in Waray today, their native counterparts being almost unheard of by the majority of native speakers numbers (except for gatus for ""hundred"" and yukot for ""thousand""). Some, specially the old ones, are spoken alongside the Spanish counterparts."
Some common words and phrases.
Below are examples of the Waray spoken in Metropolitan Tacloban and the nearby areas:
J.E.B. Stuart
"James Ewell Brown Stuart (1833-1864) was a general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. He was from Virginia. During the war, he was known for dangerous things he did while riding a horse. He was killed at the Battle of Yellow Tavern in 1864."
Riodinidae
"Riodinidae is a family of butterflies. They are commonly known as riodinids or metalmarks. Metalmarks get their name from the bright, metallic (looking like metal) markings found on the wings of most species. The family has nearly 2,000 species in it. The metalmarks are mostly found in the Neotropical region. Most metalmarks are small. Their wingspan ranges from 20mm to 65mm. Metalmarks vary greatly in wing shape, pattern, and color."
Riodinidae was formerly known as the family Nemeobiidae and as the family Erycinidae. It was also once thought to be a subfamily of Lycaenidae.
Taxicab number
"A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a sequence of special numbers: 2, 1729 etc. A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in ""n"" distinct ways. It has nothing to do with taxis, but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians: Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan."
The story about Godfrey Hardy’s taxi.
"Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. One day he went to visit a friend, the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was ill. Both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers."
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
This story is very famous among mathematicians. 1729 is sometimes called the “Hardy-Ramanujan number”.
Explanation of the Hardy-Ramanujan's number.
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes.
1x1x1=1; 12x12x12=1728. So 1+1728=1729
But also: 9x9x9=729; 10x10x10=1000. So 729+1000=1729
"There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way, but 1729 is the smallest of them."
Known taxicab numbers.
"Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan, mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three/four/five etc. different ways. These numbers are very, very big, and have been found by computers."
"So far, the following six taxicab numbers are known :"
Bernard Frénicle de Bessy
"Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (about 1605–1675), was a French mathematician. He was born in Paris. He wrote many papers about mathematics, number theory and combinatorics. The Frénicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat. He also discovered a taxicab number and in 1693, he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4."
"Like Fermat, Frénicle was an amateur mathematician, but he wrote letters to famous people such as Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, Mersenne and also Fermat, who was his friend. He is mainly remembered for his discoveries about number theory."
Soledad O'Brien
"Maria de la Soledad Teresa O'Brien (born September 19, 1966) is an American broadcast journalist. She does broadcasts for CNN and HBO. She has received an Emmy Award."
"O'Brien was born in St. James, New York."
Multi-level marketing
"Multilevel marketing is a marketing strategy. In normal marketing, salespeople get revenue which is based on their sales. In multilevel marketing, there are also rewards for recruiting new salespeople. Multilevel marketing has also been called network marketing, and referral marketing. Depending on the details, the difference between multilevel marketing and a pyramid scheme can be very small."
Naomi Wolf
"Naomi R. Wolf (born November 12, 1962) is an American feminist writer. She was born in San Francisco. She gained a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University. Her first book ""The Beauty Myth"" was published in 1990. In the book, Wolf writes that there needs to be a third wave of feminism. ""The Telegraph"" described Wolf as ""the woman who made feminism sexy""."
Wolf was born to a Jewish family. Her father is Leonard Wolf.
"In 2012 ""Vagina: A New Biography"" was published. The book got bad reviews."
Do What U Want
"""Do What U Want"" is a song by Lady Gaga. It is the second single from her third studio album, ""Artpop"". The song features the R&amp;B singer R. Kelly. The song was written by both Kelly and Gaga with DJ Snake, Tchami, and DJ White Shadow, while it was produced by White Shadow and Gaga. ""Do What U Want"" has reached the top ten in Canada and the UK and the top twenty on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. It charted moderately on other charts around the world. A music video has been made for the single but was never commercially released."
"A remix was released on January 1, 2014, featuring fellow pop singer Christina Aguilera, after she and Gaga performed the song on the competition series ""The Voice"", where Aguilera was a coach."

Batting (cricket)
"In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat. It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket."
"Any player who is currently batting is called a batter even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batter has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills."
"During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat."
"Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batters try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batters being out. Batters’ safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs."
"As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batter is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed)."

Concentrate
"A concentrate is a special form of a substance, where one of the base components is mostly removed. The most common case is the removal of the solvent from a solution: Fruit juice concentrate will have most of the water removed. The benefit of this is that the concentrate takes up less volume, and weighs less than the original solution. This can save transportation costs. When needed, the solvent can simply be added again."

Italophilia
"Italophilia is the admiration, general appreciation or love of Italy, its culture, society, arts and people. It is often related to the emulation of Italy's ideals and civilization."
Characteristics.
The term is used in two basic contexts: in international politics and in cultural context.
"""Italophilia"", ""Italophile"", and ""Italophilic"" are the terms used to denote pro-Italian sentiments, usually in politics and literature."
A huge italophilia started to develop in Europe during the centuries of the Italian Renaissance.
Actually one of the main reasons of Italophilia in the world is that Italy is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other nation in the world. These sites are culturally important and value according to UNESCO. Indeed about 60% of the works of art of the world are in Italy.
"Another reason is the worlwide appreciation for Italian culinary and foods. Italy is also a big wine producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes, and many italian wines are very famous in the world, like the ""Chianti""."
"Indeed in the American countries with a huge Italian emigration in the last centuries, there it is a widespread italophilia: Argentina, Brasil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Canada and the USA have millions of Italian descendants who promote in their society the love and appreciation for Italy."
"Actually Giorgio Silvestri (director of the ""Assemblea legislativa della Liguria"") has calculated that there are nearly 250 million italophiles in the world."

Research with Wright will have a poetic development and dialogue in many of his future creations of strong identity. The researches with Wright in an artistically unknown America in Italy will continue for years both in Arizona and in Wisconsin, also comparing themselves with other designers such as Auguste Perret, Richard Neutra in California, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Chicago to then reach his own and totally avant-garde Italian rationalist system upon his return to Italy, although open to different types of contaminations that created a concept of avant-garde design that is unique in the world."

Harp.
"There are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc.). Each pedal can change one of the letter-named notes one semitone higher or lower. For example: the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As."
Timpani.
Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like Béla Bartók wrote for pedal timpani.
Harpsichord.
Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops.
Alcoholism
Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol. People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics.
"Alcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated."
"Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism."
"Alcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed."
Diagnosis.
"Being an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking."
"To be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:"
"There is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person ""may"" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers)."
Alcoholism causes many problems.
Problems in the body.
"Alcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause:"
"If a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death."
"In 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use."
Problems in life.
Alcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include:
Alcohol withdrawal.
"If an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal."
"The most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called ""DTs""). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them."
This does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.
Epidemiology.
"In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics."
Around the world.

Giro d'Italia
"The Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, is a famous bicycle race held in Italy, every spring. It is one of the most famous, and best paid bicycle races. The first race was in 1909. It started because the editor of a newspaper called ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"" wanted more people to read his newspaper. He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903."
"The leader of the race wears a pink jersey called the ""maglia rosa"". This is because pink is the colour of ""La Gazzetta dello Sport"". For many years, the leader of the mountain climbing competition wore a green jersey (called the ""maglia verde""), but a change in the sponsor for that competition led to a jersey change in 2012. The mountains leader now wears a blue jersey (called the ""maglia azzurra""). Similarly, the leader of the sprinters' competition wore a mauve jersey (called the ""maglia ciclamino"") for many years. However, a sponsorship change in 2010 also led to a jersey change. The sprints leader now wears a red jersey (called ""maglia rosso passione""). The leader of the young riders' competition, for riders under age 25, wears a white jersey (called the ""maglia bianca""). This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France."

Tiberius
"Tiberius (Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus, 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman Emperor. He ruled from 14 to 37 AD. He was the step-son of Caesar Augustus."
"Tiberius was one of Ancient Rome's greatest generals, whose campaigns protected the northern frontier. He reigned for 22 years, and the first part of his imperial work was excellent. Later, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and somber ruler. After the death of his son Drusus in 23, the quality of his rule declined and ended in terror."
"In 26, Tiberius moved from Rome to the Isle of Capri, and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefect Sejanus. Sejanus became the effective ruler of Rome, and plotted against Tiberius, murdering people who opposed him. When alerted, Tiberius counter-plotted to remove Sejanus from his official positions, and eventually executed him. More executions followed of people who had committed crimes under Sejanus' rule."
"Caligula, Tiberius' grand-nephew and adopted grandson, succeeded the Emperor upon his death."
"In Turkey there are also minorities who speak languages such as Arabic, Kurdish, Armenian, Greek or Ladino, Romani and many others."
"Many of the young adults can also speak English, which is taught throughout Primary, Middle and High school."
Lifestyle.
"Turkish culture is a diverse culture, with some European influence."
"Different parts of Turkey have similar but not exactly the same lifestyles. Central Turkey and Northern Turkey are somewhat more conservative and religious. Western Turkey and Southern Turkey, especially coastal cities are more liberal and secular. Eastern Turkey and Southeastern Turkey are made up of mostly Kurds–most of them are conservative and religious. Cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in major cities of Turkey are overwhelmingly liberal and secular. Cities like Hatay and Mardin, where different religions coexist, and Eskişehir, which is the prominent college town of the country, also have cosmopolitan characteristics."
"Collectivism is dominant in society rather than individualism. This is seen in everything from a civilian's worldview to the socio-political and socio-economic order of the country. People care a lot about what others think of them or their related ones. Sociologist Şerif Mardin, who argues that there is neighborhood watch in Turkish society, states that ""There is no tolerance for deviations from norms in the Turkish tradition, a watching oppression is applied against individuals in this situation and this is not new."""
Traditions.
"The circumcision of boys in Turkey is very common, with over 98% of men being circumcised. This is due to religious and cultural traditions and the circumcisions are celebrated with ceremonies known as Sünnet Düğünü or at a Mevlüd ceremony."

Each province has its own little government but they can only make decisions about small things: the government in Ankara decides important issues. The provinces are in 7 regions. Each province is divided into districts. There are 973 districts altogether. The biggest Main City at the European Side of Turkey is Edirne in East Thrace.
Education.
Turkey's literacy rate is currently 98.3%. People in Turkey have to go to school for 12 years.
Istanbul University was the first university in Turkey. It was established in 1453. Ankara University was the first university that was started after Turkey became a republic. It was established in 1946.
"There were 6065 high schools in Turkey in 2002 according to Ministry of National Education. In 2011, there were 166 universities in Turkey."

"is a city located in Fukui Prefecture, Japan."
History.
"In 1889, the municipal system was introduced. 1 city - Fukui, 9 towns and 168 villages were established."
"Sabae was one of 9 towns. It had administrated 10 villages. These villages are: Funatsu Village, Shin-Yokoe Village, Shinmei Village, Tachimachi Village, Yoshikawa Village, Yutaka Village, Nakagawa Village, Katakami Village, Kitanakayama Village, Kawada Village."
In 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.
"Gozaemon Masunaga, the ""ancestor of domestic eyeglasses,"" started  manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow.  Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae’s eyeglasses industry famous."
Edo period.
"From the beginning Sabae was ruled by Manabe Clan. The Sabae area used to be the gate town of Jōshō Temple. In the Edo period, the West-Sabae Jin'ya (administrative headquarter for a small province) was under the direct control of the Shogunate. At that time, Sabae was the gate town until 1871. In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)"
"Manabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Kyōyōkei - a place where the lords can relax. Kyōyōkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park."
"When Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine."

About 4000 people are involved in the local industry, and it takes about half a year to a year to manufacture one pair of eyewear. Sabae eyewear is manufactured with the technology of titanium."
"The technology is also used in producing medical and electronic equipment. There are more than 5,000 stores in Japan that sell Sabae eyeglasses, and the average price is 35,000 yen excluding lenses now."
Process.
More than 200 steps are required to complete one eyeglasses frame. However these processes can be divided into 9 processes.

Black Forest ham
"Black Forest ham () is a variety of dry-cured smoked ham produced in the Black Forest region of Germany. Since 1997, it can only be made in a well-defined geographical area. In the case of Black Forest ham, the salting, and curing needs to be done in the Black Forest. Most of the pigs used come from other regions of Germany, or the European Union. This only applies to the European Union, though. In the United States and Canada, there are different kinds of ham which are sold as ""Black Forest ham"": These are usually produced locally, and very often, the methods of producing them are different from the original of the Black Forest."
"In 2018, about 6. 1 million tons were produced. About 85 percent was sold through discount stores, about ten percent was sold through specialized retailers, and the remaining fice percent was sold through restaurants."
Preparation.
"Raw ham is salted and seasoned with garlic, coriander, pepper, juniper berries and other spices. After curing for two to three weeks, the salt is removed and the ham aged an additional two weeks. It is then cold-smoked using ""local conifers and sawdust"" at around for several days. It ripens in an air-conditioned room for several weeks, becoming almost black on the outside and acquiring much of its distinctive flavor. As a result it usually tastes very salty."
Characteristics.
"Black Forest ham is boneless and about one-fifth fat. It has a very pronounced flavor and is common in German cuisine. It may be eaten fresh, for example on ""Holzofenbrot"" or rye bread, with fruit, or used as an ingredient in cooked dishes. Whole pieces of Black Forest ham can be preserved for months when stored properly. It is typically served at room temperature."

Otherkin
"Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside themselves, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal can be, for example, a wolf, a dragon or an alien. Some otherkin say that they are vampires and are usually acting like them, for example by drinking blood."
"Otherkin may also say they feel a special connection to other natural elements, for example minerals, the likes of fire, water, and wind, or plants."
"Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they ""are"" otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a past life, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physical bodies are not human, either, but there is no proof either for or against that."

Bonfire
"A bonfire or balefire is a large controlled outdoor fire made from bales of straw or wood. The word is believed to come from ""bone fire"". In the time of the Celts, there were midsummer festivals where animal bones were burnt to ward off evil spirits."
What it means in Great Britain.
"In Great Britain, bonfires are particularly associated with ""Guy Fawkes Night"". This night is also known as ""fireworks night"" or ""bonfire night"".

"In Northern Ireland, ""bonfires"" are associated with celebrations on the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne."
What it means in Japan.
"In Japan, large fires called bon-bi are set to welcome the return of the spirits of the ancestors. Though the two terms are not etymologically or historically related, they serve similar purposes and indicate the universal importance of large fires."
Use of bonfires for rituals.
"Bonfires were also used for rituals. The idea was that the fire would purify. It was used to consecrate things, or people, that is to make them sacred, in some way. In ancient times, cattle were important symbols of wealth and status. Such cattle were led through the smoke of a bonfire. Couples who were to be wed on May Day would leap through the flames of the bonfire to seal their vows. Coals from a bonfire would be taken home to light the fires in family hearths. This practice was thought to bring good fortune. People also believed that the residents of the Faery realm were incapable of producing fire themselves; embers of bonfires would be carried to the underworld and tended there."
Neopagan and Wiccan beliefs.
"Along with the Maypole, the bonfire is an important component of the Wiccan and Neopagan celebration of Beltaine, also known as May Day."
"Nine woods are placed into a traditional Wiccan balefire. These woods are rowan, dogwood, elder, poplar, oak, juniper, holly, cedar, and apple.

1944 United States presidential election
"The 1944 United States presidential election happened on November 7, 1944. Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as president."
"The election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate, as his health was failing. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office."
The campaign.
"The Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that ""Fala was furious"" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being ""indispensable"" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a ""motley crew"". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign."
Results.
The 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States.

"One important change in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was invented. Gas lighting was important too. Streetlights became common first, followed by lights in public buildings and home. In the 1880s people began making power stations and distribution systems to feed the new electric lightbulbs."
Economic changes.
"Britain began ruling its trading colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The British Empire now extended all over the world. It used new technologies like the railways and electric telegraph to communicate across these regions. Many British citizens moved to the colonies to make their fortune."
"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories."
Social changes.
"In the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of ""privacy"" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists."
"The printing press became faster in the nineteenth century and paper was cheaper too. The ""taxes on knowledge"" on newspapers and printed advertisements were lifted. This made magazines and newspapers cheaper. The government tried to improve literacy rates by starting schools for the poor. More books were written for, and read by, the newly educated middle classes."
Entertainment.
"More theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century."
De-Stalinization
De-Stalinization is the way that the Soviet Union tried to undo Joseph Stalin's politics and the heroic image he created of himself using propaganda.
"After Stalin died, a group led the Soviet Union for a while. Georgi Malenkov was the Premier of the Soviet Union; Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Ministry of the Interior; and Nikita Khrushchev was First Secretary of the Central Committee."
"Because Stalin had so prominent a control over the Soviet Union, he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among communists abroad. In the years 1953–1955, a period of ""silent de-Stalinization"" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation."
Revisionism.
"In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union. He attempted to reform the Soviet government and change how socialism in the country should be ran. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, this is called revisionism. He removed Stalin's corpse out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd. Some people disliked Khrushchev’s reform and those who oppose revisionism are called anti-revisionist."

Dizzee Rascal
"Dylan Mills (born 18 September 1984, better known as Dizzee Rascal) is a musician who grew out of the UK Garage music scene, although he has been known to distance himself from this genre. He is also known for being present on pirate radio stations. His music is a combination of both garage and hip-hop beats, also with his own original style of rapping."
History.
"Dizzee Rascal's first song to be released was ""I Luv U"" - a tale of accidental teenage pregnancy. His first album ""Boy In The Corner"" was released in 2003 with good reviews."
The same year (2003) Dizzee Rascal was stabbed in Ayia Napa. Some newspapers tried to link this to a conflict between Dizzee and a UK-based hip-hop group So Solid Crew.
"Dizzee has been described as ""the vital unvarnished voice of modern-day inner-city UK"", and a social element is usually present in most of his songs. However, Dizzee proves that social commentary does not have to be boring. There is often a funny element to his singing, and some might find this (very British) humour similar to that of Mike Skinner of The Streets."

Cosmopolitan distribution
In biology an organism is said to be cosmopolitan (or cosmopolite) if it can be found almost anywhere on the Earth.
Examples include:
Bengalis
"The Bengali people are the main ethnic group in the region of Bengal (now divided between Bangladesh and the Republic of India) in South Asia. They speak Bengali (বাংলা Bangla), a language of the eastern branch of the Indo-Aryan languages."
"They are natively concentrated in the nation of Bangladesh and in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura. Some of the most well established Bengali communities are in the Middle East, Japan, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States."
"Remnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic peoples. The origin of the word ""Bangla ~ Bengal"" is unknown, but it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ""Bang"" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC."
"After the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the ""Atharvaveda"" about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Persia and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ""Gangahrd"" (Land with the Ganges in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire."
Baloch people
"The Baloch (بلوچ) are an Iranian ethnic group who live in the region of Balochistan which includes parts of southeastern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and southwestern Pakistan."
"The Baloch speak the Balochi language, an Iranian language. They mainly live in mountainous places of the Iranian plateau in Iran, Pakistan and parts of Afghanistan. Balochistan is a mountainous region inhabited by the Baloch people."

Wheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
"If the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency."
There are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing:
Stridor.
"Stridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing."
Stridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because:
"Like wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways."
Treatment for stridor depends on the cause:
Children are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor.
Rales (fine crackles).
"Rales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds."
"Rales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like:"
"Rales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs."
Rhonchi (coarse crackles).
"Rhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are:"
"Rhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi."
Unequal breath sounds.
"In a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung."
One of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons:
A pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital.

Computer-generated imagery
"Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is using computer graphics, especially in movies. These images are used for special effects, simulation, and commercials, amongst others. Sometimes the technology is used to produce a static background, which is then merged into the image; at other times it is used to produce animations in 2D or 3D. In its broadest sense, a computer- generated image (CGI) can be defined as any image that is created with the use of a computer- based processor or program. Because computers are widely used, both in image generating and in image processing, these images are pervasive- from billboard advertisements to film productions and photography."

The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.
People can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.

"This Murrinh-patha mythology is based on a view of life that believes life is ""...a joyous thing with maggots at its centre."". Life is good and caring, but during life's journey, there are many painful sufferings that each person must come to understand and live through as he grows. This is the message being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people reason and meaning in life."

"""Current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order."""
"Within this Pintupi view of the world, three long geographical tracks of named places control and guide society. They are interrelated strings of important places named and created by mythic characters on their way through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming.

Evolution of the population
"In accordance with Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD (""21 years of reign"")."
Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 153 AD (120 years of reign).
Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 154 AD (121 years of reign).
"AD 54, AD 153 or AD 154 maybe either his year of ""death"" or ""removal from the power of monarchy"", which is not confirmed."
Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years. This does not exclude the theoretical possibility that in the case of a fortunate combination of mutations there could be a person who lives longer.
Some scientists cautiously suggest that the human body can have sufficient resources to live up to 150 years.
"According to Anuradha Dutta and ‎Ratna Bhuyan, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was murdered and his queen Laisana saved their son, ""the prince""."
Worship as a god.
In traditional Meitei religion.
"Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human."
"According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing ""divine"" in daytime and appearing ""humanly"" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of ""divine origin"" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion."
In Hinduism.
"According to 's ""The Meitheis"" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to ""Enoog Howba Chonoo"", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga (""Dapar Jug"") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga (""Kali Jug""), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, ""Jobista"" (also spelled as ""Yavista"") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata."
"In the 18th century AD, the ""Vijay Panchali"" (also spelled as ""Bijoy Panchali"") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as ""Yavistha""."
"Notably, in the year 2020, ""A Short History of Manipur"", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata."
In art and culture.
"In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of ""Nongda Lairen Pakhangba"" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL)."
"Ritual ceremonies are performed and the ""Salai Taret Huiyen Lalong Thang-Ta Lup"", giving guard of honour, hoists the flag of Nongda Lairen Phakhangba."
The ceremony is performed for the purpose to preserve and promote the indigenous art and culture of Kangleipak.

&lt;revision&gt;
"Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century. This came from a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley challenged the safety of benzoate. In response, business owners, particularly Henry J. Heinz, pursued a different recipe that did not use that preservative."
"Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin. This was due to the use of unripe tomatoes. Those tomatoes were low in pectin. They were less vinegary than modern ketchups. By pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated. There was also no spoiled ketchup or loss in flavor. The changes also helped make it an important American condiment according to some experts."
"Until Heinz, most commercial ketchups appealed to two of the basic tastes: bitterness and saltiness. But the switch to ripe tomatoes and more tomato solids added a stronger ""umami"" taste. The major increase in the concentration of vinegar added sourness and pungency to the range of sensations experienced while eating it."
"In the past, ketchup was produced from fresh tomatoes after harvesting. Vacuum evaporation made it possible to turn tomatoes into a very thick tomato paste. This made it easy to store at room temperature. This allows a factory to produce ketchup throughout the year."
Later innovations.
"In fast food chains, ketchup is often put in small packets that hold ketchup inside. Users tear the side or top of the packet. They then squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets. In 2010, Heinz is offering an alternate squeeze and dip cup. This is meant to offer a cleaner method of dispensing the product."
"In an earlier approach, some fast food outlets dispense ketchup from pumps into paper cups. Some restaurants still use this method."
"In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt. They included green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue colored ketchup. These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. these products have been discontinued."
Standards and Regulations.
Regulations in Canada.
"In Canadian markets, the manufacturing of ketchup is regulated by the Food and Drug Regulation. Ketchup, a heat processed product, must be made from the juice of red-ripe tomatoes or sound tomato trimmings where the skins and seeds have been removed. The ketchup must contain vinegar, salt, seasoning and a sweetening ingredient. They may also contain a class II preservative and food colouring, though not required."
Regulations in the United States.
"In the United States, ketchup is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ketchup must be prepared from a tomato concentrate, juice from mature red Lycopersicum esculentum tomatoes or liquid residue from preparing tomatoes for canning or partial juice extractions. The tomato skins, seeds and other hard substances must be strained. Additionally, ketchup must contain any combination of vinegars, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and/or spices, flavouring, onions or garlic."

Garret FitzGerald
"Garret Desmond FitzGerald (9 February 1926 – 19 May 2011) was an Irish politician who served twice as Taoiseach (prime minister) of Ireland, from 1981 to 1982 and again from 1982 to 1987. Elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Teachta Dála (TD), he served as Ireland's foreign minister from 1973 to 1977 and as leader of Fine Gael from 1977 to 1987."
Early life.
"FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, His mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent."
"He was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD). A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer), a fellow student whom FitzGerald would marry in 1947."
He later qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.
Early political life.
"FitzGerald was eager to enter politics and, although it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil (including Charles Haughey) that he should join them, he made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South-East constituency."
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
"After the 1973 general election, Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, however the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, with his innovative views, energy and fluency in the French language, won Ireland a status in European affairs far beyond the country's size and ensured that the first Irish presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success."
Leader of Fine Gael.
"In 1977, the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen by acclamation to succeed him."
"Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. After the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas than Fianna Fáil, who had been the dominant force in Irish politics for 40 years."
Taoiseach 1981–82.
"By the time of the 1981 general election, Fine Gael won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach, on 30 June 1981."

Fachhochschule Düsseldorf
"The Fachhochschule Düsseldorf is a so-called Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences), that means a special kind of college, with technical, design and business subjects in Düsseldorf."
It was founded in 1971.
Psychoanalysis
"Psychoanalysis is a field of psychology and medical therapy. It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others."
"Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children."
The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:
The unconscious mind.
Sometimes people cannot say why they are feeling the way they feel or acting the way they act. What causes the feelings and actions is called the unconscious mind in psychodynamic theory.
Different methods.
"Under the broad umbrella of ""psychoanalysis"" there are at least 22 different approaches to the theory and clinical treatment. The term also refers to a method of studying child development."
"Freudian psychoanalysis uses a type of treatment where the subject (analytic patient) talks, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams. From these the analyst works out the unconscious conflicts which cause the patient's symptoms and character problems. By interpreting them for the patient, the analyst creates insight into the problems. The analyst identifies and clarifies the patient's pathological defences, wishes and guilt."
"Psychoanalysis has been criticized on many fronts. It has been called a pseudoscience, and lacking in empirical support. However, it remains influential within psychiatry, more so in some quarters than others."
Zaandam
"Zaandam is a city in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It has about 74,000 inhabitants (2014). It makes part of the municipality of Zaanstad."

Windows 3.x
"Windows 3.x was a family of Microsoft Windows operating system, released in 1990-1994. Notable operating systems in this family include Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing many things at once). Windows NT 3.x was released in 1993-1996."
"It also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These included a calculator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start&gt;Run&gt;progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better."
"Windows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support."
Woodwind instrument
"A woodwind instrument is an instrument belonging to the woodwind family. Traditionally they were always made of wood, although some of them are now made of metal or plastic."
In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument. Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes:
"The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments. The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves. The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra. It plays one octave higher than the flute. There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute. Flutes are still sometimes made of wood, but mostly they are metal."
The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute. There is a larger version called the cor anglais (which means: “English horn”). This is a double reeded instrument. The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute. The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet. The bassoon is the lowest of the four.

Joint
A joint is the place where two or more bones make contact. They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support.
"Joints have cartilage in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described structurally and functionally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones."
Synovial bursa.
"A synovial bursa is a small fluid-filled sac lined by a synovial membrane. It has an inner capillary layer of viscous synovial fluid (bit like raw egg white). The bursa is ""a cushion between bones and tendons"" and/or muscles around a joint. This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement."
Hosni Mubarak
"Muhammad Hosni Said Mubarak (; 4 May 1928 – 25 February 2020), commonly known as Hosni Mubarak (), was an Egyptian politician. He served as President of Egypt from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011."
Mubarak became the vice-president of the Republic of Egypt after moving up the ranks of the Egyptian Air Force. Then he became the President after President Anwar Sadat was assassinated on 6 October 1981. His almost thirty-year presidency made him Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha.
"As President of Egypt, Mubarak is thought to have been one of the most powerful leaders in the region. Under the 1971 Constitution of Egypt, Mubarak exercised strong control over the country and was generally considered a dictator. In 2005, he called an election and easily won it. Many opponents believed Mubarak changed the election results so he could win."
"In early 2011, during the Arab Spring, there were huge protests against his government. In the end, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to the armed forces. It is hoped that elections later that year for a new government. On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the shooting of protesters in the revolution that ousted him."
"On 13 January 2013, Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak's sentence and ordered a retrial. On retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on 9 May 2015 of corruption and given prison sentences. Mubarak was detained in a military hospital and his sons were freed 12 October 2015 by a Cairo court."
He was acquitted on 2 March 2017 by the Court of Cassation and released on 24 March 2017.
"He died on 25 February 2020 at a Cairo hospital after having surgery, aged 91."
Euclid
"Euclid of Alexandria () (about 325 BC–265 BC) was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria. Little is known about this person, but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh. It is not known where and when he was born."
The Elements.
"Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry, which is part of mathematics. His ""Elements"" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms."
"The ""Elements"" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of ""greatest common divisors"". They were in his ""Elements"". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers."
"The geometrical system described in the ""Elements"" was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries which mathematicians developed in the 19th century."

Banco Galicia
"Banco Galicia is a private bank of Argentina. It belongs to the Grupo Financiero Galicia. It was founded in 1905 as Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires, and traditionally its Board of Directors was made up of members of the Escasany, Ayerza and Braun Menéndez families. Its shares began trading on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in 1907."
History.
"Banco Galicia was founded in 1905 by a group of businessmen from the Galician community in Argentina, and in 1907 its shares began trading on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. In 2000, Grupo Financiero Galicia was created and became the controlling company of the Bank, acquiring 100% of its shares in 2014."
"The commercial network grew significantly at the end of the 1950s and continued to expand to the 326 branches it has today, developing its potential and earning its reputation as an innovative bank, currently considered a leader and reference within the national banking industry."
"In the late 1950s, Banco Galicia launched the capital investment fund FIMA Acciones and founded the predecessor of the asset manager Galicia Asset Managment."
"As part of its growth strategy, Banco Galicia began to expand into rural areas in the interior of the country, where it was believed that there was high growth potential. Access to financial services in the interior was limited compared to Buenos Aires and its surroundings, and its population used fewer banking services."
"In 1979, it launched the first ATM network in the country, together with 4 of the main banks in the financial system. In order to expand its network throughout Argentina, in 1986 Banco Galicia offered to open 13 branches with ATMs in the province of Santiago del Estero in exchange for placing the Bank's characteristic symbol on the province's flag, as well as It is how today the cross of Santiago can be seen on the provincial flag."
"Between 1995 and 1999, Banco Galicia acquired shareholdings in various entities and formed several non-banking companies that provided financial services -mainly through the issuance of own-brand credit cards- and insurance."
"In 2000, it launched the first Internet financial portal in Argentina and in 2006 the first payment service through a bank's cell phone in Argentina."
"After being significantly affected by a deep economic and financial crisis in 2001 and 2002, Banco Galicia managed to recover to resume its leadership position. It is currently one of the main banks in the Argentine financial system, being the most important among those in the private sector with national controlling capitals."

Bain-marie
"A bain-marie (or water bath) is a piece of equipment used in science, industry, and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time."
Description.
"The bain-marie comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working liquid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source."
Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid.
"The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container, filled with the working liquid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching."
"When a bain-marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of water at sea level). Using different working liquids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures."
Alternatives.
"A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric ""dry-heat"" bain-marie, heated by element below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts."
"Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or ""bath""), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam."
Origin.
"Bains-marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy, when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently. In that early form of chemical science, it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes, occurring in the Earth's core, by which precious metals were believed to be germinated."
"The name comes from the medieval-Latin term ""balneum"" (or ""balineum"") ""Mariae""—literally, ""Mary's bath""—from which the French ""bain de Marie"", or ""bain-marie"", is derived. There are many theories as to how the name ""Marie"" came to be associated with this equipment:"

"Web-based survey have come a long way, from 1980s where first email surveys were conducted to 1990s when initial web-based surveys were introduced. There were almost $500 million spent on web-based surveys in 2002, and According to Inside Research this number climbed up to about $960 million in 2004."
"But despite the advances in survey research, there are still many short comings and problems, such as declining response rates, limited online data bases, mistrust about survey uses (true research versus selling), survey length, issues concerning privacy and security, internet surveys being looked at as spam by some etc."
"Most of Online Surveys that are real will not pay cash, but instead give vouchers or prizes."
"Online or Internet surveys are very useful for many companies. People get rewarded for answering questions about a product, a company or any questions that will help the company to work better."
"Many companies pay people to take a survey, but some are for free."
"In era of digital surveys there is many fraud cases where user will be not paid after completing one. Some ways of avoiding fraud sites is to check them on MyWot, review sites or by simply checking their reviews on forums."
It is getting more popular to fill surveys to get access to website or valuable content.
"Another popular form of surveys that has recently emerged are daily surveys. Daily survey panels allow their members to participate in surveys everyday. The user is taken through a router where they can keep trying to qualify until a survey is found that matches their demographics. Daily surveys pay less than most paid surveys, but the opportunity to qualify is much greater and payouts are usually cash instead of prizes."

"Richardson served as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1970 to 1973, Secretary of Defense from January to May 1973, Attorney General from May to October 1973, and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four Cabinet positions within the United States government (the other such individual being George Shultz)."
"On December 31, 1999, Richardson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79."
Frequency probability
"Frequency probability or Frequentism is one of the interpretations of probability theory. Repeating a scientific experiment very often gives a number of results. It is then possible, to count the number of times that a given event happened and compare it to the total number of experiments."
"This interpretation of probabiilty was very important for statistics. People who use this interpretation are often called Frequentists. Well-known frequentists include Richard von Mises, Egon Pearson, Jerzy Neyman, R. A. Fisher and John Venn."
Other interpretations of probability are Bayesian probability and Axiomatic probability theory
Satellite navigation
A satellite navigation or satnav system is a way of pinpointing position very exactly.
"Satnav uses a system of satellites. The system gives exact positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to find their position (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation). The position is given within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a straight line (line of sight) by radio from satellites. The signals also allow the receivers to calculate the current local time to high precision. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be called a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Global Positioning System is the biggest and most used GNSS. GLONASS, owned by Russia, is the second biggest. China, India, and the European Union are working on similar systems of their own."
Bad Santa
Bad Santa is a 2003 American Christmas criminal black comedy movie.
Property law
"Property law covers two types of property in the common law legal system, real property and personal property. In the civil law system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property is more or less the same as personal property. It includes money, stocks, notes, copyrights and patents."
History.
"The idea behind all property law is property. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch. Land ownership was through land tenure in feudal systems. The first legal right of absolute ownership was under Roman law and was called ""dominion""."
Length of time.
"Disputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong."
Fundamental values.
"Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals."
Media spread disputes.
"A second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute."
Laws.
"Laws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute."
How disputes are resolved.
Negotiation.
"The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful."
"The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated."
Mediation.
"Professional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations."
Time.
"Some disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation."
Law.
"All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not."
Direct action.
"Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute."
Education.
"Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict."
Democracy.
"Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies."
Examples.
"Of course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance."
Seating capacity
"Seating capacity is the highest number of people who can sit in a specific space. This limit can be either from the amount of space available, or from a law saying how many people are allowed to be there at a time."
"Seating capacity can be for different kinds of things. It can be the number of people who can fit in a vehicle, for example an automobile or an airplane. It can also be for a stadium. The largest sports building in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity of more than 257,000 people. Seats can be added on the field to raise that number to about 400,000."
Apotropaic magic
"As one of the main branches of mathematical analysis, it can be seen as the real-number counterpart of complex analysis, which deals with complex numbers. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis."
Cabo Corrientes
Cabo Corrientes is a cape on the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is the most southern point of the Bahía de Banderas.
Homeland
"A homeland (rel. ""country of origin"" and native land) is the concept of the territory (cultural geography) to which an ethnic group holds a long history and a deep cultural association with. It's the country in which a particular national identity began."
Strike (attack)
"A strike (or blow) is an attack with an inanimate object, such as a weapon, or with a part of the human body. It is intended to harm an opponent."
Mazatlán
"Mazatlán () is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa; the surrounding ""municipio"" (municipality) for which the city serves as the municipal capital is also called Mazatlán. It is located at on the Pacific coast, just across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula."
"Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word meaning ""place of the deer."" The city was started in 1531. By the mid-1800s a large group of immigrants had arrived from Germany. These new citizens made Mazatlán into a successful commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. They also influenced the music, banda, which is an form of Bavarian folk music, and also started the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900."
"Mazatlán, with a population of 352,471 (city) and 403,888 (municipality) as of the 2005 census, is the second-largest city in the state (after Culiacán) and Mexico's largest commercial port. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. A car ferry across the Gulf of California from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur exists. The municipality has a land area of 3,068.48 km² (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, El Habal and many other small villages."
Mazatlán is served by Gral. Rafael Buelna International Airport.

Rennet
Rennet is a set of enzymes made from the stomachs of mammals. It is used in things like suet and cakes. It can also be used to make cheese.
Kol people
"The Kols, also known as Kolarians, are the original inhabitants of modern-day West Bengal and North-east India. The term Kol has been corrupted by the Aryan-Sanskritic speakers to the word ""kalu"", meaning both ""black"" and ""ugly"", in almost all of the 16 major languages of the subcontinent. The Kolarians are a Dravidian peoples stock group, whose descendant communities can be found also in West Bengal and elsewhere in the eastern part of the East India."
"Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 6.5 million years ago during the Tertiary era. Semi-recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago. A 10,000 to 15,000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district. This Neo-stone age began 3,000 BC lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements."
"Physically, the indigenous peoples of eastern India were long-headed, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature. Sometimes labeled as ""Negritos"" and ""Negroids"", their physical features are unchanged today among the lowest castes of Bengal, mainly the peasants, as well as 95% of population of West Bengal today who derive from these lower castes and tribes."
Sena dynasty
شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْطِ ۚ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ١٨
"Allâh bears witness that Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in Justice. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise."
Purgatory
"According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, Purgatory is the ""final purification of the elect"": ""All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."""
"“In Purgatory there are different levels; the lowest is close to hell and the highest gradually draws near to Heaven. It is not All Souls Day, but, Christmas, that the greatest number of souls leave Purgatory."
"There are in Purgatory, souls who pray ardently to God, but for whom no relative or friend prays on earth. God makes them benefit from the prayers of other people."
"It happens that God permits them to manifest themselves in different way, close to their relatives on earth, in order to remind men of the existence of Purgatory and to solicit their prayers to come close to God who is just, but good."
Purgatory in art and culture.
"Perhaps the best-known instance of purgatory in the arts is Dante's ""Purgatorio"", the second book of his ""Divine Comedy"". Likewise, the Ghost in William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" may also presuppose a belief in purgatory,"
William Blake
"William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker. He was born and died in London."
"During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. Blake's first collection of poems, ""Poetical Sketches"", was printed around 1783. His most famous poem ""And did those feet in ancient time"" was, over 100 years later, put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called ""Jerusalem""."
Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organised by the BBC in 2002.

Institution
An institution is a social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live.
"An institution has a purpose. Institutions are permanent, which means that they do not end when one person is gone. An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior. The word ""institution"" can be used in two ways. It can mean a very broad idea, or a very ""specific"" (narrow) one. For example:"
"Institutions, in the broad sense, are found in every society. The way that each institution works is different in different cultures. Some important institutions are:"
"Some societies have many institutions in the ""specific"" sense. These societies have an organised government, schools, hospitals, churches, clubs, armies, markets, courts and places for entertainment. Some societies have very few of these things, but this does not mean that there are no ""institutions"". The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many ""controls"" as in a society with schools, markets and a government. An example of a society that has lots of ""specific"" institutions is Western Europe."
Historians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods. They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions.
Race (biology)
"In biology, races are distinct populations within the same species with relatively small morphological and genetic differences."
"The populations are ""ecological races"" if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or ""geographic races"" when they are geographically isolated."
"If sufficiently different, two or more races may be described as subspecies, which is an official biological taxonomy unit below 'species'."
"If not, they are called ""races"", which means that a formal rank should not be given to the group, or taxonomists are unsure whether or not a formal rank should be given."
"Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, is the world's northernmost capital city."
Seat of government.
"Most countries have their seat of government within their capital. However, Malaysia has its capital at Kuala Lumpur, but its seat of government is at Putrajaya. In the Netherlands, the constitution calls Amsterdam the capital, but the seat of government is The Hague."
Climate
"Climate means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other meteorological patterns in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. In simple terms, climate is the average condition for about thirty years. Climate and weather are different: weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere."
"The types of climates are: Tropical, Desert/dry, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean."
"The latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the Köppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from."
Climates can change after a long time. Nowadays people are making the world warmer.
Fold (geology)
"Rock often deforms in such a way that it bends instead of breaking. This is called a fold. The term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat, level surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature. The basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics."
"When two forces act towards each other from opposite sides, rock layers are bent into ""folds"". How folds are formed due to compression is known as folding. Folding is one of the endogenetic processes; it takes place within the Earth's crust."
"Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes, on a variety of scales. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a ""fold belt"", a common feature of orogenic zones."
There are large-scale and small-scale folds. Large-scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates.
Structure of a fold.
The upfold is called an anticline. The downfold is called a syncline.
The imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line.
The flanks of a fold are known as the limbs.
The central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold.
"According to the degree of folding of the layers, folds can be classified into five main types."
Formation of a fold mountain.
Large depressions called geosynclines form between plates. Seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments (sand and silt) which build up on the sea bed.
"Over millions of years the sediments were compressed, by their own weight, into sedimentary rocks, e.g. sandstone, limestone etc."
Landforms formed by folding.
Large-scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round-top mountains along destructive plate boundaries. These mountains are known as fold mountains.
Examples of fold mountain ranges:
Volcanism
Volcanism (or vulcan activity) is the eruption of magma onto the surface of the Earth.
"Magma under the crust is under very great pressure. When folding and faulting occur, cracks or fractures appear. These are lines of weakness."
"When these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma, they will release the pressure in the magma. This allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust. Some magma may even reach the Earth's surface as lava."
"There are some natural languages which are simplified, such as Basic English and Special English."
"An artificial language is quite different, as it is built for some special purpose. They are always very precise, and must be used according to pre-set rules. Symbolic logic, mathematics, programming languages."
Windows Mobile
Windows Mobile is a discontinued operating system that came with basic applications for mobile devices.
It is designed to look like desktop versions of Microsoft Windows.
"The first version was Pocket PC 2000, released in April 2000. It was based on the kernel of Windows CE 3.0 (Handheld PC 2000). Then came Pocket PC 2002, released about two weeks before Windows XP. It was similar to 2000, having full compatibility with Windows CE. Windows Mobile 2003, released in April 2003, was the first version called Windows Mobile. It was software-compatible with Windows"
CE 3.x and 4.x.
"Windows Mobile 5 was released around July/August 2005. It was similar to WM2003, except for a few new additions."
Windows Mobile 6.0 was released in February 2007 and had a kernel powered by Windows CE 6.x.
"6.1 in 2008 was much the same, and 6.5, released in 2009/2010, was the last version."
It was discontinued in March 2010 and replaced by Windows Phone.
"Microsoft ended sale of Windows Mobile devices on June 13, 2010 and ended all support of it on August 21, 2010."
"Two months later, Windows Phone was released."
Shoot (professional wrestling)
"A Shoot is something in professional wrestling that is completely real and is not scripted. In other words, broken kayfabe. A shoot rarely happens."
Worked shoot.
"On the scripted level, a Worked shoot is a scripted segment that takes place in a show with elements of reality being exposed, such as an off-screen incident between wrestlers being used as fuel for an on-screen rivalry between them. It can also be a segment that fans are meant to believe is a shoot, but is not."
Proto-World language
A Proto-World language is a possible proto-language that all other languages came from.
Sustainable biofuels
"Biofuels are fuels from plant materials. They offer the prospect of oil price moderation. Some biofuels can supply sustainable energy. Responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia."
Biofuel options.
"There are many biofuel options which are available. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition."
"Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources."
Lord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several trade-offs:
"Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product."
"According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland."
Plants used as sustainable biofuel.
"Since June 2022, floods in Pakistan have killed at least 1,191 people, including 399 children. The floods were caused by monsoon rains and melting glaciers. It is the world's deadliest flood since the 2017 South Asian floods. On 25 August, Pakistan declared a state of emergency because of the flooding. By 29 August, it was said that around 'one-third' of the country was underwater. By 2 September, the death toll passed 1,200."
Milutin Šoškić
Milutin Šoškić (Serbian Cyrillic: Милутин Шошкић; 31 December 1937 – 27 August 2022) was a Serbian professional footballer. He played as a goalkeeper. He made 50 appearances for Yugoslavia national football team between 1959 to 1966. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1960.
Šoškić died on 27 August 2022 at the age of 84.
"Aptos, California"
"Aptos (Ohlone for ""The People"") is an unincorporated town in Santa Cruz County, California."
Manuel Duarte
"Manuel Almeida Duarte (29 May 1945 – 2 September 2022) was a Portuguese footballer. He played as a striker. He played for the Portugal national football team, making two appearances in 1966."
Duarte died on 2 September 2022 at the age of 77.
Cadena nacional
"In several Latin American countries, a ' (; plural '), also referred to as a ' () or ' () is a joint transmission through the media, generally radio and television stations, which aims to reach the largest number of inhabitants of a State. These types of broadcasts are usually of a political nature, since they are mostly messages from government authorities about different matters of general interest, as well as the transmission of electoral debates for the elections to the executive power of each country."
"The institutional characteristics of the national chain vary according to the legislation and customs of each country.  It may be a resource officially provided for in legislation or the name may be used informally, to describe a coordinated transmission. The coupling of the different media to the signal of the official chain can also be voluntary or compulsory.  Similarly, the national network can be used for different types of transmissions in addition to the official messages of the State authorities."
Criticism.
Argentina.
"During the government of Cristina Kirchner, the number and frequency of ""Cadenas Nacionales"" increased, some media criticized their use as not limited to cases of ""institutional significance""."
"The then National Senator for Citizen Unity Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, at the presentation of his book ""Sinceramente"" in Rosario (Argentina), said that ""he does not regret the national channels, since otherwise the media would not have shown the public policies of the then President of Argentina""."
"During the administration of the President Mauricio Macri, its use decreased."
Chile.
"In Chile, during the period of the Popular Unity, some radio stations (mainly from the opposition), got off the ""Cadenas Nacionales"" to broadcast their normal programming. At that time they were mandatory."
Honduras.
"Another similar situation was the opposition, on the part of the Honduran press, to broadcasting national channels during the government of President Manuel Zelaya, considering that ""in the past the ""cadena nacional"" system was used constantly, mainly by the de facto governments, without satisfactory results""."
Venezuela.
"Mandatory national channels with political content have been strongly criticized by some media, since in some countries they must broadcast content that often differs from their editorial line."
"That was the case of the radio station RCTV in Venezuela, an opponent of Hugo Chávez, which refused to broadcast a message from the ruler in 2007, despite the fact that in said country there is a Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, which obliges radio and television to broadcast information from the Executive Power. Currently, a ""Cadena nacional"" is broadcast almost every day, normally headed by Nicolás Maduro or Delcy Rodríguez."
Expulsion of Jews from Spain
"The decision of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile to banish the Jews from Spain in the year 1492. While Jews who converted to Christianity were not banished, Tomás de Torquemada and the Spanish government still tortured many of them. They did not believe that the converted Jews were really Christian in the Spanish Inquisition."
Flirting
"Flirting is a form of human behavior from one person toward another person, or between two people, usually showing a sexual or romantic interest in the other person. It can include conversation, body language (such as winking), or short physical contact."
Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness or honesty is mainly a moral value. A trustworthy person is someone in whom we can place our trust and be sure that the trust will not be betrayed. Examples could be
"The first example is moral. It depends on what we know about the person, their family and upbringing."
"The second example is technical. We would need to know what kind of jobs the person had done before and, perhaps, what kind of training he had."
"In order for one to trust another,their worth and integrity must be proven over time. That applies especially to the first (moral) case."
"Trustworthiness in technical matters may be identified by attributes such as reliability, dependability and qualifications."
Shamisen
"The shamisen or samisen (Japanese: 三味線, literally ""three taste strings""), also called sangen (literally ""three strings"") is a Japanese musical instrument with three strings, that is played with a big plectrum called a ""bachi"". The pronunciation in Japanese is usually ""shamisen""."
Obi
"Obi (帯, おび) is a Japanese word meaning ""belt"" or ""band"". Mostly, it is used to describe the types of sash worn with kimono and keikogi."
"Obi are worn by both men and women. They can be very simple, made of one layer of lightweight fabric, or decorated heavily, made of stiff, woven material, embroidered and dyed with different designs."
"Obi for men are less wide and shorter than obi for women. Men mostly wear ""kaku"" obi, but sometimes wear ""heko"" obi, which are made of much softer material. ""Heko"" obi are worn casually, but ""kaku"" obi can be worn casually and formally."
"Obi for women are much wider and longer. Most women usually wear a ""nagoya"" obi, which is wider at one end. In summer, women wear ""hanhaba"" obi with ""yukata"". Formal obi for women can be woven from metallic yarns, covered in embroidery, or dyed in an elegant design."
"Obi for women are usually the most expensive part of a kimono outfit. However, obi for men can be expensive as well. Expensive obi are usually made by very skilled artists. Some of these people are called National Living Treasures because they are so skilled."
"Obi worn for practicing martial arts are a lot thinner and shorter than other kinds of obi. They come in different colours, and the colours show how skilled someone is in practicing martial arts. When someone becomes skilled enough, they wear a new colour of obi. Both men and women wear the same size and length of obi in martial arts, and they are not decorated with embroidery or dyes designs."
Nitrogen fixation
Nitrogen fixation how nitrogen in the air (N2) is changed (converted) into ammonia () or other nitrogenous compounds in the soil.
"Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because nitrogen compounds are needed for making all nitrogen-containing organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids."
"Atmospheric nitrogen is a relatively unreactive molecule. It is useless to all except a few bacteria and archaea. Biological nitrogen fixation converts into ammonia, which is used (metabolized) by most organisms."
Nitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways:
Biological.
Microorganisms that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs).
"Cyanobacteria are in most environments on Earth. They play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. Cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids."
Several cyanobacteria are also diazotrophs which can fix nitrogen from the air. This is an ability which may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archaean.
"Cyanobacteria in coral reefs can fix twice the amount of nitrogen than on land—around 1.8 kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day. The colonial marine cyanobacterium ""Trichodesmium"" may fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen-fixation in marine systems on a global scale."
Root nodule symbioses.
"Sometimes a mass will change to energy. Common examples of elements that make these changes we call radioactivity are radium and uranium. An atom of uranium can lose an ""alpha particle"" (the atomic nucleus of helium) and become a new element with a lighter nucleus. Then that atom will emit two electrons, but it will not be stable yet. It will emit a series of alpha particles and electrons until it finally becomes the element Pb or what we call lead. By throwing out all these particles that have mass it has made its own mass smaller. It has also produced energy."
"In most radioactivity, the entire mass of something does not get changed to energy. In an atomic bomb, uranium is transformed into krypton and barium. There is a slight difference in the mass of the resulting krypton and barium, and the mass of the original uranium, but the energy that is released by the change is huge. One way to express this idea is to write Einstein's equation as:"
E = (muranium – mkrypton and barium) c2
"The c2 in the equation stands for the speed of light squared. To square something means to multiply it by itself, so if you were to square the speed of light, it would be 299,792,458 meters per second, times 299,792,458 meters per second, which is approximately"
(3•108)2 =
(9•1016 meters2)/seconds2=
"90,000,000,000,000,000 meters2/seconds2"
So the energy produced by one kilogram would be:
"E = 1 kg • 90,000,000,000,000,000 meters2/seconds2"
"E = 90,000,000,000,000,000 kg meters2/seconds2"
or
"E = 90,000,000,000,000,000 joules"
or
"E = 90,000 terajoule"
"About 60 terajoules were released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima. So about two-thirds of a gram of the radioactive mass in that atomic bomb must have been lost (changed into energy), when the uranium changed into krypton and barium."

"The idea of a Bose-Einstein condensate came out of a collaboration between S. N. Bose and Prof. Einstein. Einstein himself did not invent it but, instead, refined the idea and helped it become popular."
Zero-point energy.
The concept of zero-point energy was developed in Germany by Albert Einstein and Otto Stern in 1913.
"Momentum, mass, and energy."
"In classical physics, momentum is explained by the equation:"
where
"When Einstein generalized classical physics to include the increase of mass due to the velocity of the moving matter, he arrived at an equation that predicted energy to be made of two components. One component involves ""rest mass"" and the other component involves momentum, but momentum is not defined in the classical way. The equation typically has values greater than zero for both components:"
where
There are two special cases of this equation.
"A photon has no rest mass, but it has momentum. (Light reflecting from a mirror pushes the mirror with a force that can be measured.) In the case of a photon, because its m0 = 0, then:"
"The energy of a photon can be computed from its frequency ν or wavelength λ. These are related to each other by Planck's relation, E = hν = hc/λ, where h is the Planck constant (6.626×10−34 joule-seconds). Knowing either frequency or wavelength, you can compute the photon's momentum."
"In the case of motionless particles with mass, since p = 0, then:"
which is just
"Therefore, the quantity ""m0"" used in Einstein's equation is sometimes called the ""rest mass."" (The ""0"" reminds us that we are talking about the energy and mass when the speed is 0.) This famous ""mass-energy relation"" formula (usually written without the ""0""s) suggests that mass has a large amount of energy, so maybe we could convert some mass to a more useful form of energy. The nuclear power industry is based on that idea."
"Einstein said that it was not a good idea to use the classical formula relating momentum to velocity, p = mv, but that if someone wanted to do that, he would have to use a particle mass m that changes with speed:"
"In this case, we can say that E = mc2 is also true for moving particles."
"Conserved sequences are similar or identical sequences which occur in DNA, and cause sequences in RNA, proteins and carbohydrates."
"These sequences occur across species. This shows that the sequences has been maintained in evolution despite speciation. The further back up the phylogenetic tree a particular conserved sequence occurs, the more highly conserved it is. Since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny by genes, a conserved sequence implies that there is a conserved gene."
"Conservation of a sequence happens when mutations in a highly conserved region lead to non-viable life forms, that is, a form which is eliminated through natural selection. In other words, the product of the gene is vital to life, and its function is destroyed by almost all changes (mutations) to the sequence."
Conserved nucleic acid sequences.
"The basic theory, widely agreed, is that highly conserved DNA sequences must have functional value, though the role for many of these highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences is not known. One recent study that eliminated four highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences in mice yielded viable mice with no significant phenotypic differences; the authors described their findings as ""unexpected"". So there is clearly something here which is not understood."
"Many regions of the DNA, including highly conserved DNA sequences, consist of repeated sequence elements. If only one of a set of a repeated sequences was removed, and the repetitions were not needed, then no difference would be seen in the mice. The paper did not report whether the eliminated sequences were repeated sequences."
Conserved protein sequences and structures.
"Highly conserved proteins are often required for cells to work or divide. Conservation of protein sequences is shown by the presence of identical amino acid residues at analogous parts of proteins. Conservation of protein structures is indicated by the presence of functionally equivalent, though not necessarily identical, amino acid residues and structures between analogous parts of proteins."
"Shown below is an amino acid sequence alignment between two human zinc finger proteins. Conserved amino acid sequences are marked by strings of formula_1 on the third line of the sequence alignment. As can be seen from this alignment, these two proteins contain a number of conserved amino acid sequences (represented by identical letters aligned between the two sequences)."
Comparative genomics.
The research field which studies the evolution and function of multigene families is called comparative genomics.
FAMAS
"The FAMAS (Fusil d'Assaut de la Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne, in English ""Assault Rifle from the Saint-Étienne Weapon Factory"") is a bullpup-styled assault rifle designed and manufactured in France. It's the main assault rifle of the French Army, French Air Force, and French Navy since 1980. It was also sold for export."
Designed in 1973 FAMAS uses a 5.56mm NATO (.223) caliber cartridge. Muzzle velocity is between 925m/s and 960m/s following variants.
Gouvernemental users.
Militaries and polices of that countries uses FAMAS.
Sabbath (disambiguation)
"Sabbath is a weekly day of rest or worship in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity:"
It might also mean:
Substitution reaction
"In chemistry, a substitution reaction happens when an atom or a group of atoms is replaced by a different one. Substitution reactions can be of many different types."
"In organic chemistry, the main ones are nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution. These take their names from electrophiles and nucleophiles. However, substitution reactions can also happen under other conditions. For example, photochemical reactions (reactions that use light instead of heat) are used to put halogens in a molecule. Another example is using free radicals. Choosing the correct solvent and temperature conditions is very important to make sure that the reaction happens. Sometimes an elimination reaction can happen instead."
"The product of a substitution reaction is often called a substituted molecule. For example, phenol can be called a substituted benzene."
Joey Lauren Adams
"Joey Lauren Adams (born January 9, 1968) is an American actress. She acts mostly in movies. She has a strong raspy voice. She acted in the comedies ""Chasing Amy"" (1997) and ""Mallrats"" (1995)."
"Adams was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas."
The American President
"wait a minute,"
we bought one in ninety.
"We've got three cars, of all things."
Uh-huh.
"So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan."
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
"Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,"
"we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have"
Uh-huh.
"and then, of course, we look into the prices."
Yeah.
"And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted"
"because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time."
"Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"So, uh,"
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,"
"and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they, they, uh,"
"I've been extremely,"
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles."
"but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,  you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you went to school,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"you can do this,"
"you can do that,"
Uh-huh.
we couldn't do that then.
"And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children."
"I'm out of school,"
"I'm twenty-three,"
"I can do anything I want to do, anything."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now,"
"but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do."
"And that's normal,"
"I mean,  I think that's the world today."
"And yeah,"
and I
"and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do."
"I have so  you know,"
Right
that's
"not a lot of people,"
Yeah.
but it's depressing too.
"That's how, I mean,  What, I'm right now."
"What do you, what do you that you're,"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's
"yeah,"
that's a hard thing about it.
"If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married"
"but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work."
"I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either."
"Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well."
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
Yeah.
"I just, I couldn't do it I don't think."
"It would just rip me apart, I think"
I don't know.
Yeah.
Just not knowing.
"Yeah,"
"just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait."
"What do you usually wear to,"
"Well, let's see."
"It turns out that, uh,"
I work at TEKTRONIX
"and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes."
Uh-huh.
"You just wear, uh,"
let's see.
"When I first came here, I wore suits"
"but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important."
I'm an engineer.
"Oh, I see."
"And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
I don't remember.
"I, I read it."
And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?
Yeah.
"And, and then, but then the medicine."
"And, and some of these other things"
"and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,"
milliliter.
It's all metric all ready.
Yeah.
"And, and so, um, but, but when you go to order a drink, um, you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's uh ..."
And what will a shot be?
Will a shot be an ounce?
I don't know.
"And, and, but, you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, you know, well this box is, is, uh, is, is twelve ounces"
"and, and this one's, uh, uh, three pounds, um,"
and you ...
"And the other one's two point one kis,"
"and, and you're, you're lost."
That's right.
"And, and I don't know."
"I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone."
"I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems."
"Oh, yeah."
The economy.
Yes.
"Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. Uh,"
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.
Personal tools to be able to do his job.
Yeah.
"But, but are, are the tools that, uh,"
I could be wrong.
"Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise"
"but I,"
I do not know for sure either.
"But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas."
It had a different feel to it.
Yeah.
"It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south."
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it is not dry.
"And, and I have lived here for many years,"
and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.
"Where the water is coming from, I don't know."
Uh-huh.
"Well, it could be."
"I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,"
"Oh, does he live near the lake?"
"Well, there is a lake not far"
"but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that."
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times."
"That is, that is a problem, uh,"
"they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Because of that.
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.
"So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them."
Right.
"And I don't know all the details on that,"
"but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury."
Yeah.
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
Uh-huh.
Do you have any?
"Yes,"
we do have a pet.
"We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,"
"well, we call it the S P C A."
"It's the, uh, from an animal shelter."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, he'd come in there as a stray."
All right.
"Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross."
Yeah.
"Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him."
"Uh, he's,"
"Oh, that's good."
"You don't often find that,"
I don't think.
"No, uh,"
"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him."
Sure.
"There's a,"
"okay, uh,"
I know.
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
Uh-huh.
"We, we do that sometimes."
"I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff."
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.
"I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,"
Yeah.
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS
"or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,"
"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?"
"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch."
Uh-huh.
"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those."
"Just some of the times they're continued,"
but mostly they're just little vignettes.
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.
Have you seen that?
Huh-uh.
"That is, it's, it's really funny."
"They use like animated,"
"it's not like a cartoon,"
"but it's like dummies and things, that are used,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it's really, um,"
and robots probably.
"But there's always a, a moral to each story."
And what night is it on?
"Well, we watched it,"
"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night."
"Uh, but it's,"
we've only seen it a couple of times.
"Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?"
"but,"
"Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art"
and it's in art education.
"Oh, okay."
"So, I'm a licensed teacher"
"but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach"
Yeah.
and that way I have time for my kids too.
And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.
I don't know how long that's going to last
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, they're cutting back,"
so I don't go in all that often
"but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things."
"Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars"
"and I say, oh no"
"and , and I go"
and I make it.
Yeah.
That's how I started jewelry making.
"I, I love to cook."
"Oh, that's great."
"And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff"
and I went
"and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you"
and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
Exactly.
And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
It took me a lot of time
"but  it didn't,"
"Oh, yeah."
I've caught it a few times
"and they, they do some pretty good news."
"Uh, seemingly unbiased news broadcasts."
"Uh uh, the, the title of the network is sort of surprising."
Uh-huh.
You'd think it would carry mostly religious
"but it, it doesn't seem to."
"So I'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too, uh, and catch something maybe a little different than, than C N N might be covering."
"Uh, some more interest type topics in, in other countries."
"But it's kind of world, world, uh, network too."
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I guess I've never seen the T V show."
"I used to get the, uh,"
"A, uh, Golden Retriever."
"Ooh, that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs."
Yeah.
Is it really?
How long have you had it?
"We've had him for,"
"let's see, he just had his fourth birthday."
Fourth birthday.
"Yeah,"
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
"and, uh, he's pretty okay,"
we like him.
Does he shed a lot?
He does.
That's the one thing we don't like about him.
"In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off."
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
How much does he weigh now?
"He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,"
not being able to put it off for fifteen years.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in"
"and they, they get off for good behavior"
"and, I don't know,"
"up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty."
"And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. Because they figure well, you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something."
"Uh, but then for,"
"if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten."
"Oh, really?"
"Oh, sure, you know."
Goodness.
"I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh,"
"I don't know,"
I think that may solve a lot of that.
Yeah
"Maybe not solve it,"
"but, I don't know,"
"maybe ,"
"I, yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient."
Yeah.
"Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty."
Uh-huh.
What do you do Georgeanne?
I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.
"Oh, okay."
Great.
What program you in?
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.
They like to play.
Um.
Especially with the kids.
They love to play with kids.
"Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?"
"No,"
he's pretty much an inside dog.
Um.
He stays in.
"We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much"
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
"Oh, really?"
He's really a wimp.
"And when it comes to being alone,"
"uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,"
but he does not like to be tied outside.
"He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark."
"Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?"
"No,"
"he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well"
"and, uh, he knows where our yard is"
"and we have a pretty small yard,"
but he seems to know the boundaries.
Um.
"And he usually is good about staying within them,"
"although our next door neighbors have a dog, too"
"and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog."
"Oh, yeah?"
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
"but, he's pretty good."
He stays out of the street
Oh
and so then she crawls on the carpet
"and, oh, the smell I mean it's just really awful"
Uh-huh.
"and that's, that's one real drawback,"
but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
"Yes,"
you will.
You will.
"You know, we were trying to decide to, you know, about putting him to sleep."
"He was just, you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too."
"And, and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. You know,"
"and, and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, you know,"
"and, and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child."
Uh-huh.
"And, and, you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, you know."
Little thing.
"Be quiet,"
be quiet.
"And I can tell my husband, you know, deep down he, you know, he"
"Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?"
"Hi,"
"fine,"
I'm Nancy.
How are you?
"Great, Nancy."
I'm in Plano also
"You're in Plano also, huh?"
"Yes,"
we're not too long distance today.
"Well, good to hear."
I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns"
"and, uh, uh, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, that  come through town and everything"
Uh-huh.
"and, I mean, they just have, I mean they have anything you'd want,"
I mean
Uh-huh.
"you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing."
You can just go buy one and take it home
"and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store."
"I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago"
"and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"You just go and, uh, buy the gun"
"and, uh,"
There's no restriction though.
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?
No.
"Well, except for the, the pistols and"
I'm not sure how they do that.
"I know they,"
"Yeah,"
"I was just curious, you know, because, uh"
Uh-huh.
"I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple  of weeks"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and then they check you out,"
then they call you up
and you go pick it up.
"I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas,"
"and you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, you know,"
"it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I was up there last weekend,"
"and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on,"
"and they're green,"
but they're dead
"You know, the, the freeze just got them."
"They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,"
"and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all."
"Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all."
Really weird this year.
"I'm not sure what that, what that means."
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now."
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
"So you, you all actually had some color, huh?"
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
It kind of crept in
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"we, we did, for a time."
"Yeah,"
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Gorgeous.
"That's, you know,"
"I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not,"
"and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same."
"Yes,"
"we're, we're smarter now."
We know what we can do
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"uh, so let's see."
So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.
Uh-huh.
"And so the second question, forgot what the second question,"
"What was it, uh,"
what do the trends in families
"and do we approve what other, families do."
"Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing."
That's right.
"But I have seen  lately, yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,"
A change?
I was going to say the same thing.
schools are not able to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or whatever, uh,"
Right.
Right.
and the family
"Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh."
"those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal"
"and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing."
Uh-huh.
"So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,"
so
Oh.
"I firmly believe that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
okay.
I think Florida still uses electric chair.
Yeah
"Uh, I don't, I don't know."
In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God.
Yeah.
"And that's not,"
I don't think that's right.
"But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it."
Yeah.
I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
"and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um,"
Yeah.
with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year.
"They,"
Yeah.
That's what's happening here.
"There is,"
"like, uh, that's,"
"in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, uh, uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again."
Uh-huh.
Sure.
"And it's like, you know, that's a big problem"
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
Uh-huh.
"and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a a big problem."
Yeah.
"Uh, go ahead."
"I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't."
Right.
"Be a little more, you know,"
uh-huh.
"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you."
"But each of these had an annual fee also, right."
Exactly.
"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card,"
I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up
Uh-huh.
"but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, five dollars a year."
"Yeah,"
forty five.
"Right, uh,"
"I,"
"Which was a lot,"
"because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month."
"Exactly, you know,"
"I, that's it,"
"I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,"
"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free."
Uh-huh.
"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa,"
"and here, most of the stores will accept those,"
and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I had a Discover,"
"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing."
"Um, it really wasn't my choice, though."
"I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards."
Oh.
"Um, I ended up going through a credit counseling service um, because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
I was just thinking
"I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis."
"I really,"
"From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana."
"And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the,"
"what is it,"
it's based on common law
and the rest of the country is not or something like that.
Yeah.
Pretty strange.
"But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty."
"Yeah,"
"I haven't either other than,"
"But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness."
He may subpoena me.
So we'll see what happens.
"But, uh,"
I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .
Yeah.
"It's,"
"there are too many big problems, you know."
"There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know, to try to get them all in in a good time"
I know.
and we already have too many lawyers as it is.
Yeah.
"And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, in fact, they're even letting some go."
Yeah.
"I, I, I'm originally from Florida"
Yeah.
"yeah,"
seven yards of sand.
"I got to shovel it all, lots of fun."
"Yeah,"
"I have to do that,"
"I want to make some flower beds,"
and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.
Uh-huh.
"And I'm going to,"
my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter
Sure.
"but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there"
Right.
"Well, it seems,"
"I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers."
"I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds,"
"but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything,"
"I mean,"
"Yeah,"
"I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,"
I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird
Uh-huh.
but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.
And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.
"Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,"
"Yeah,"
"but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too."
"Oh, that's right."
"there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too."
Yeah.
"Well, I'm not really worried about it,"
"Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,"
so
"Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it"
Yeah.
"the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western"
"a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar,"
yeah.
"and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music."
They just play a certain number of chords
Yeah.
"the drummer plays a certain beat,"
and you have a country and western song
Um.
"and,"
"Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess."
"They don't really,"
"has kind of the same sound over and over,"
and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
Um. Right.
"you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too."
Yeah.
"And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,"
Yeah.
"but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll"
Yeah
earlier things.
"and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ..."
Hello?
Hi.
"Hi,"
my name is Leslie.
"Hi,"
Uh-huh.
Does San Antonio
"you said San Antonio, right?"
Uh-huh.
"Do you have just one paper,"
or do you have several?
No.
"There are two,"
and they're pretty close.
"Uh, the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
I grew up near Houston
Uh-huh.
"and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
"and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up. I mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff."
Uh-huh.
"It's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
"and I enjoy,"
the comics are better in this newspaper.
This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
and the other one has some weird ones that I've never heard of.
"So,"
"I, I actually take both newspapers on the weekends."
Do you?
"I figure I'm only taking on the weekend,"
and I can afford that.
Yeah.
"I, I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better,"
"but I sort of have a liberal political slant,"
"and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook."
"And my, My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers."
I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit.
"He takes both San Antonio papers, an Austin paper, both Houston papers,"
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
so do you all keep a budget?
"No,"
we don't.
You don't?
"No,"
"I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it."
And we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck.
"It's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm,"
you can just spend it well.
"Are you being smart,"
or are you serious?
I'm being facetious.
I'm being very comical.
"Uh, we have a budget, um that works well."
Uh-huh.
"I kind of look at it for more of a,"
"we have a financial, uh, analyst, a finance administrator, I guess, that, that, uh,"
"I guess the financial planners, the training now."
We've had it for about four years here.
Uh-huh.
"Got our businesses and, and, and our life in line, how to manage credit cards, how to put away, say for, you know, money markets and this kind of thing."
Yeah.
"And, there's some freebies out there are"
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"That being money market, uh, bonds, , savings, uh, or just a liquid account which, which we do."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that."
Do you know?
"No,"
"we can,"
"after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording  this."
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, can you tell me anything else about the house"
Are you working on it?
"I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?"
Yeah.
"This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice."
Yeah.
"That's, that's nice."
"Yeah,"
"the town that I came from is, uh, is a, uh, older town,"
"it like,"
"the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,"
Wow.
and I renovated a house there
and that was so much fun.
"I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically"
"And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline"
"and, uh, was considered typical for that area."
"So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box"
"and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it."
"But, uh, anyway,"
Living in the city has some advantages.
Yeah.
That's true.
"If given the choice, I'm getting out."
"Oh, really."
"Well, I have lived in a small town for, you know,"
Really.
"I mean, uh, uh, the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood,"
"and my wife didn't know,"
"and I stopped payment on the check,"
and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm.
"And, and they're suing us, they're suing me on this,"
and it's for a hundred and thirty-four dollars.
"Oh, my."
Absolutely pathetic.
I stopped payment on a check.
"Oh, that's funny."
"Oh, this last week, we bought a sewing machine at Zak's,"
and then I found that you could get the same machine better for less locally.
"Not much less, but it was enough less,"
and I found they locally serviced it.
And we just stopped payment on the check.
So I hope they don't sue us over it
"But we never received any merchandise either,"
so I don't think it would hold Anyway.
"Oh, okay,"
well
"probably something like that,"
"did you call them and tell them you just, you just."
"No,"
we didn't even call them.
We just did it.
Maybe my husband should call today.
"Might be a good idea, because you're going to get, what, a, a check,"
"Well, this is kind of ironic because I work in T I legal department."
Do you?
"And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, um, lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time."
Uh-huh.
"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

"Justin has admitted to have spent ""more than his means"" on his gear. The following list includes some of his acoustic guitars, as well as the electric guitars he has owned and performed with."
"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song ""Knock on Wood"" and ""Crown"" (unofficial title)."

= = = Norman Dyhrenfurth = = =
"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."

The founding board consisted of Riyadh Bahr Al-Ouloom, Abbas Fakhruddin, Firas Nouri, Haitham Abbas, Ali Juwad, Yasin Khudhair, Mustafa Mohammed, Hassan Juwad, Wisam Fawzi and Basim Radhi. The club entered the Iraq Division Two and was promoted to the Iraq Division One in the 2010–11 season. In the 2011–12 season, Naft Al-Wasat made their first transfer from other clubs, signing Karrar Abd from Kufa FC in January 2012. In the 2011–12 season, Naft Al-Wasat barely qualified to the second stage, after having 8 wins, 6 draws and 4 losses, only a point away from Kufa FC. In the second stage, Naft Al-Wasat finished in 4th place of the Group 2, at 12 points, after having 4 wins and 4 losses, ending their first season in the Division One with failure."
"In the 2012–13 season, Naft Al-Wasat failed again to qualify. In the groups stage, they became in top of Group D, at 27 points, being won 7 matches, drawn in 5 and lost only one. In the second stage they had a big breakdown, finishing in 5th place in Group 2, after winning only one match, drawing in 5 and losing 3. In the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup, they reached the third round before being eliminated. In the first round, they defeated Samawa 4–0, and in the second round they eliminated Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya by beating them 4–3 on aggregate (the first leg was 1–1 and the second leg was 3–2). In the third round, they lost the first leg to Masafi Al-Wasat 2–1 and drew the second leg 2–2, being knocked out 4–3 on aggregate.<ref name=""Iraqi FA Cup 2012/2013""></ref>"
"After the 2012–13 season, the technical staff was changed, signing the manager, Abdul Ghani Shahad, on 27 August 2013. In the 2013–14 season, Naft Al-Wasat were promoted for the first time in their history. They were in top of Group E at 34 points, 8 points away from Al-Diwaniya FC, which was a big difference from last seasons. In the second stage, Naft Al-Wasat took the Group 4 lead, at 20 points, by winning 6 matches and drawing in two. They ended their season as the leaders of Group 1 in the last stage, claiming promotion to the Iraqi Premier League."
"After the end of the 2013–14 season, the club made major changes to get ready for the 2014–15 Iraqi Premier League with the total of 8 players signed, but the most important signing was Noor Sabri. Naft Al-Wasat were one of the teams that weren't expected to qualify to the second stage. Despite losing a third of their games in the first stage, finishing in 4th position out of ten teams in their group, Naft Al-Wasat just about managed to qualify for the final stage, after wins against the likes of Erbil and Al-Zawraa; this itself was considered a big success for the young team. In the second stage, the team surprised everyone by defeating Al Shorta SC (the defending champions and one of the strongest contenders for the league championship) twice. After taking the Group 1 lead, Naft Al-Wasat got qualified to the league final, where they won over Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya via a penalty shoot-out."
"Their league title win qualified them for the 2016 AFC Cup. They finished top of Group B with a record of five wins and one loss, but they lost 1–0 in the round of 16 to Al-Jaish. They were not allowed to play their home matches in Iraq in this tournament due to security concerns. In the 2015–16 Iraqi Premier League, Naft Al-Wasat finished in second place in their group, behind eventual champions Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the final stage. In the final stage, Naft Al-Wasat finished as runners-up, again behind Al-Zawraa. As the league's runners-up, Naft Al-Wasat qualified for the 2016–17 Arab Club Championship, where they got revenge on Al-Jaish by knocking them out to qualify for the group stage."

In the bottom side is the Arabic name of the club and their hometown name, Najaf, written under it."

"""The Guns of Brixton"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was written and sung by bassist Paul Simonon, who grew up in Brixton, South London. The song has a strong reggae influence, reflecting the culture of the area and the reggae gangster film ""The Harder They Come""."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""

"Guerrero was rumored to be signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with early reports putting his deal in the seven-year, $32 million area. However, his initial agents turned out to not be licensed and he switched to Scott Boras, who said the bidding was now wide open. On October 21, 2013, it was reported that Guerrero had reached a new agreement with the Dodgers, that would be worth $28 million over 4 years.

Guerrero had his first official at-bat the next night, and struck out. After the two-game opening series in Sydney, Australia, Guerrero was optioned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes."
"During a game against the Salt Lake Bees on May 20, 2014, Guerrero was involved in a dugout scuffle with Albuquerque teammate Miguel Olivo in which Olivo bit off a portion of Guerrero's ear. He had to undergo a complicated plastic surgery operation to reattach the ear, necessitating several days in the hospital.

The Dodgers recalled him when rosters expanded on September 1. He recorded his first Major League hit with a single to left field off of Erik Cordier of the San Francisco Giants on September 13. He appeared in 13 games with the Dodgers, primarily as a pinch hitter though he did play in left field for a few innings. He had just the one hit in 13 at-bats."
"In spring training, Guerrero made it clear he intended to exercise an unusual clause in his contract that allowed him to refuse an assignment to the minor leagues. As it happened, he hit so well during spring training that he convinced the Dodgers he belonged on the opening day roster, despite concerns about his defense."
"In his first start of the season, Guerrero had three hits in five at-bats. One of the hits was his first MLB home run, hit off of Óliver Pérez of the Arizona Diamondbacks."
"After two weeks, Guerrero was hitting so well that there was clamor for him to become the regular third baseman, as incumbent Juan Uribe was getting off to a slow start. Uribe, however, picked up his production, and Guerrero continued to be used in a utility role, playing at third base and at left field and pinch hitting. Despite not being a regular starter, Guerrero was named Rookie of the Month for April 2015, his first full month in the Major Leagues. He hit .423 with five homers and 13 RBI in only 13 games."
"On June 2, with the Dodgers trailing the Colorado Rockies by three runs and down to their last strike in the top of the 9th inning, Guerrero hit the first grand slam of his career just over the center field wall to drive in what would be the winning run for the Dodgers."
"His production tailed off down the stretch but he wound up playing in 117 games with 11 homers, 36 RBI and a .224 batting average."
"Guerrero injured his knee in spring training in 2016, causing him to begin the season on the disabled list. In a minor league rehab stint across three different levels in May, he played in 16 games and hit .136. When he was ready to rejoin the team, there was no spot available on the active roster so Guerrero was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on May 31, 2016 and removed from the 40-man roster. The Dodgers released Guerrero on June 8."
"On November 26, 2016, Guerrero signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Nippon Professional Baseball. Guerrero broke a Chunichi record for most consecutive games with a homerun after he cleared the fence against the Rakuten Eagles on 3 June 2017. He however fell short of equalling the NPB record of 7 consecutive games with a homerun set by Randy Bass and Sadaharu Oh as he failed to register a hit in the final match of the series against the Eagles on 4 June. Guerrero was selected for the 2017 Central League All-Star team by choice of the manager. The Dragons released Guerrero on December 2."
"On December 17, 2017, Guerrero signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for a two-year 800 million yen ($USD million) deal."

= = = Abdul Karim Khan = = =
"Ustad Abdul Karim Khan (Devanagari: अब्दुल करीम ख़ान, Persian: <bdi> </bdi>) (11 November 1872 – 27 October 1937), was an Indian classical singer and, along with his cousin Abdul Wahid Khan, the founder of the Kirana gharana."
"Abdul Karim Khan was born on 11 November 1872 in Kairana town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh into a family with music tradition which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula. His father, Kale Khan, was the grandson of Ghulam Ali. Abdul Karim Khan received training from his uncle Abdullah Khan and father Kale Khan. He also received guidance from another uncle, Nanhe Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was musically influenced by Ustad Rahmat Khan of Gwalior gharana. Apart from vocals and sarangi, he also learned Veena (Been), Sitar and Tabla."
"According to a story, he was initially a sarangi player, but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players. In his early years, he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq. They appeared before Murtaza Khan of the ""Maula Bakhsh Khandan"" to appear before the Maharaja (king) and were influenced by Murtaza's style. The king of Baroda State was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians. This is where he met Tarabai Mane, who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane, a member of the royal family. When they decided to get married, they were ousted from Baroda. The couple settled down in Bombay. In 1922, Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan, which apparently had a major impact on his music – making it pensive and meditative. Karim Khan's first wife, Gafooran, was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan, who was also his cousin."
"""One of the most melodious classical musicians we have had, Abdul Karim Khan's music always created a sublime atmosphere. The soothing quality of his specially cultivated voice, and his repose style of singing were such that the singer as well as his listeners forgot themselves in a sort of 'trance'."""
"Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music masters who also influenced his music. In particular the singing of his sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice. He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Palace which conferred on him the title ""Sangeet Ratna"". On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva. In 1900, for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar, who would go on to be one of the 20th century's most renowned vocalists. In 1913, he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach music students. He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the South. Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj in his honour."
The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others. The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya (slow tempo) was the most characteristic aspect of his music. He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music. The thumri style he developed is also quite different from the 'Poorab ang' or 'Punjabi ang'. His thumri progresses in a leisurely slow pace with ample abandonment. He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the South. He has even recorded a Thyagaraja Krithi. He was also influenced by Rehmat Khan of the Gwalior gharana and adopted the direct style of presentation.
"""Although frail-looking, Khan Saheb maintained excellent health through regular exercises, disciplined habits, and frugal living. His photographs show him as a tall, slim person dressed immaculately in a black 'achkan', a cane in hand, a typical moustache and a red gold-bordered turban, and most striking of all, his dreamy eyes."""
"Abdul Karim's disciples include Rambhau Kundagolkar (Sawai Gandharva), Roshan Ara Begum, Sureshbabu Mane, and Vishwanathbuwa Jadhav."
Ustad Abdul Karim Khan died on 27 October 1937

Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current."
"Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico."
"In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous ""Clubhouse Turn,"" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000."

"In heraldry, a mount (also mountain, hill, hillock) is a representation of a hill or mountain as a curved terrace in base. When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge."
"A trimount, also described as ""a mount mounted"", or ""shapournet shapourned"", is a representation of a mount with three tops. For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as ""coupeaux"" (e.g. ""a mount with six coupeaux"")."
"The trimount (in German, ""Dreiberg"") can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland."
"A design of six hills (""Sechsberg"") can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops. Mounts with more than three tops are blazoned as a ""mount of N coupeaux"", e.g. German ""Sechsberg"" would be a ""mount of six coupeaux"", German ""Zehnberg"" as a ""mount of ten coupeaux"". A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as ""Schroffen"" in German heraldry."
"A ""terrace in base curved"" is blazoned ""mount"", ""hill"" or ""hillock"" when represented in vert; sometimes as ""a mount vert"" for clarity. Sometines, a ""terrace in base curved"" may be blazoned as ""mount"" even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation."
"The coats of arms of Hungary and Slovakia depict a trimount, first used in the seal of Stephen V of Hungary (r. 1270–1272)."

In 2010, the team also had the distinction to play in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) under the name Capitanes de Puerto Rico. The team began play in the league in 1946. Home games are held at Manuel Iguina Coliseum, which the team shares with the Capitanes de Arecibo men's volleyball team."
"The team has won seven BSN Championships (1959, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018) and has had a total 16 finals appearances, being a runner-up 9 times (1932, 1946, 1948, 1961, 1966, 1992, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017). Capitanes is the only team to participate in all editions of the FIBA Americas League, having entered the final four twice (finishing 2nd in 2010 and 3rd in 2013)."
"In 1946, coached by Wilfredo Franco, Tingo Díaz, Piro Méndez and for a pre-Olympic tournament, the Capitanes emerged. A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quicón Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaquín Balaguer, Armando Villamil, y Pipe Beníquez showed themselves to be a part of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place."
"On August 19, 1959, the Capitanes won their first basketball championship against the Rio Piedras Cardinals at the Rodríguez Olmo Stadium in Arecibo. They were coached by Lou Rossinni, and the heroes of that series were Jaime Frontera, Francisco Pancho Padilla, Felipito Colón, Bill MacCadney, José (Fufi) Santori Coll, Moisés Navedo, José Rodríguez Gómez, Eddie Martínez, José Vázquez, José Aponte, Angel Morales, Jaime Miranda, Joe Phillip Padilla hijo, Ramón Siraguza, Enrique Miranda, and Sitín García. This team is the only team in BSN history to have gone the entire season, including the playoffs, undefeated."
"In 1992, coached by Alfred “Butch” Lee, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals with elite players Ferdinand Morales, Rafael Hernandez, Giovanni Colón, Fitz Roy Brow, Juan Griles, Orlando Febres, Bryan and Mark Santiago, losing a hard-fought series against the Ponce Lions."
"The Capitanes in 2002 wrote another page in the history of their city and the BSN when the so-called ""kids"" broke the predictions of the media and basketball analysts by taking a semi-final series to Game 7 with young talents Giovanni Jiménez, Rick Apodaca, Buster Figueroa, Pachy Cruz and David Cortes; and veterans Félix Javier Perez, Javier Rolón and Oscar Chiaramello."
"In 2005, general manager Regino Babilonia hired Carlos Mario Rivera as head coach and the Captains again won the BSN Championship (4-0) over the Bayamón Cowboys."
"In 2007, with David Rosario at the command of the Captain Ship, and the fiery players Rafael “Pachy” Cruz, Ángel “Buster” Figueroa, David Cortes, Carlos Payano and Marcus Fizer as reinforcement, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals. In a historic, sold-out Game 7 at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, where 75% of the attendees were from Captain Correa City, the Arecibo Captains came back from a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit to force an overtime. In a hard-fought and emotional series of plays and calls, the Captains came up just short of another championship."
"During the 2008 season, the Capitanes advanced again to the finals against the Carolina Giants. The series went to seven games, with both teams winning three games at home. Arecibo won the seventh game, 99-94, for the third championship in the franchise's history. Ángel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player."
"It was forty-six years since the Captains succeeded in that first championship. That was on August 19, 1959. They came short in 1966 when they lost in overtime against Ponce and in a seventh game finals held at the court of Manuel Carrasquillo Herpen Country Club. In 1992 the attorney Hiram Ruiz saw the Lions come from behind in the series to thwart another major celebration in Arecibo."
"In 2005, there were doubts. However, unlike the team of 1959, the 2005 edition played with many ups and downs during the regular season and also in the ""round robin"", for example beating the best in the league but losing to last-placed teams. The reason for not dominating as expected was the failure of the team's ""Refuerzo"" (reinforcement player), former rebounding leader and prolific scorer, center Nick Davis, who did not meet the team and fan's expectations, as well as his following replacements until the arrival of Richard Lugo."
"In the ""round robin"" the Captains won five and lost as many games. The team was torn between changing Dickey Simpkins or staying with the player that looked more like a fifth man with the added reinforcement that was hurt."
"With all that were chosen as a finalist in the analyzes that the Cowboys favored above all others for having excelled in the second stage of the tournament. Unlike the 1959 champion who went undefeated, these Captains had to earn their stripes."
The Captains got a breaks with the elimination of Ponce. The Lions were the best team that could match-up with the Captains and successfully handle the full-court press.
"The Captains then faced a remodeled Santurce, with former Nigerian NBA player Olumide Oyedeji. The series became complicated and unpredictable."
It was then that Edgar Padilla appeared on the scene.

= = = Lead(II) hydroxide = = =
"Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH), is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO·2Pb(OH)) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past."
"When a hydroxide is added to a solution of a lead(II) salt, a hydrated lead oxide PbO·xHO (with x < 1) is obtained. Careful hydrolysis of lead(II) acetate solution yields a crystalline product with a formula 6PbO·2HO = PbO(OH). This material is a cluster compound, consisting of an octahedron of Pb centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the MoS subunit of the Chevrel phases."
"In solution, lead(II) hydroxide is a somewhat weak base, forming lead(II) ion, Pb, under weakly acidic conditions. This cation hydrolyzes and, under progressively increasing alkaline conditions, forms Pb(OH), Pb(OH)(aqueous), Pb(OH), and other species, including several polynuclear species, e.g., Pb(OH), Pb(OH), PbO(OH)."

The bishop even composed pro-Crusade ""sirventes"" for the troops to sing. Count Raymond VII, however, forbade the citizens to go and tried to force Folquet from the city. The White Brotherhood did go, however, and the bishop eventually left as well, to join the siege at Lavaur."
"The White Brotherhood gained notoriety among the opponents of the Crusade. The troubadour Gavaudan wrote the song ""A la plus longa nuech de l'an"" in which he criticises the ""foolish white people"", almost certainly a reference to the Whites of Toulouse."

"The Italy national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Italy in international cricket. They have been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1995, having previously been an affiliate member since 1984. The Italian national cricket team is administered by the Federazione Cricket Italiana (Italian Cricket Federation)."
"In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Italy and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Italy played their first T20I against Germany in May 2019. From August 2019, Italy will play in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League."
"The earliest mention of cricket in Italy is of a match played by Captain Morgan's sailors in Bayside, NY in 1793 during a stop in Naples harbour. Around the end of the 19th century, several combined cricket and association football clubs formed, including the world-famous A.C. Milan, which was originally the ""Milan Cricket and Football Club"" and the first Italian football team Genoa Cricket and Football Club, which was originally the ""Genoa Cricket & Athletic Club"". But these clubs soon forgot about cricket and concentrated on football. Cricket started to be revived after the Second World War."
"The ""Federazione Cricket Italiana"" (Italian Cricket Federation) was formed in 1980, and they became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1984, and were promoted to associate member in 1995."
"In 1996, Italy took part in the first European Championship in Denmark, finishing seventh after beating Israel in a play-off. They took part in the ICC Trophy for the first time in the 1997 tournament and performed poorly, finishing joint last out of the 22 participants. They finished fifth in the following years European Championship."
"In 1999, Italy took part in a quadrangular tournament in Gibraltar also featuring France and Israel. They won the tournament, beating the hosts in the final. They finished fifth in Division One of the European Championship the following year and were due to participate in the 2001 ICC Trophy, but pulled out at the last minute due to a dispute over the eligibility of four players."
"The 2002 European Championship saw Italy finish sixth in Division One, relegating them to Division Two for 2004, which they promptly won. This qualified them for the repêchage tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They finished seventh in that tournament after beating Zambia in a play-off."
"They took part in Division One of the European Championship in 2006, finishing fifth. In May/June 2007, they travelled to Darwin, Australia to take part in Division Three of the World Cricket League. They finished seventh after beating Fiji in a play-off, and played in Division Four of the World Cricket League in 2008 to come 3rd and remained in 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Four. They came 2nd there to be promoted to 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where they came 4th to remain in 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three. They have a chance of reaching the 2015 Cricket World Cup, if it finishes in the top two in the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, and then in the top two of the 2013 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. An encouraging start to this tournament has witnessed wins over Oman (9 wickets) and United States (8 runs), followed by defeats, narrowly to Ireland (2 wickets) and more comprehensively against Kenya (7 wickets). After finishing last in this tournament they will be relegated to Division Four in 2014"

= = = Joe Cesare Colombo = = =
"Joe Colombo, born Cesare Colombo (30 July 1930 – 30 July 1971) was an Italian industrial designer."
"Cesare ""Joe"" Colombo was until 1949 educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the academy of fine arts, in Milano as a painter and studied afterwards until 1954 Architecture at Politecnico di Milano University."
"In 1951 he joined the ""Movimento Nucleare"", founded by Sergio D´Angelo and Enrico Baj. The following four years Colombo was active as a painter and sculptor of the abstract Expressionism and exhibited his works with other members in Milano, Torino, Verviers, Venice and Brussels."
"In 1955 Colombo joined the Art Concret group, but gave up his painting to promote his Design Career. Before he cooperated at an exhibition for the tenth Triennale of 1954 and documented the Ceramic Designs of an international meeting in Albisola. For his presentation Colombo created for example three exterior seatings which were combined with a ""shrinelike"" presentation of TVs."
"In 1959, Colombo had to take over the family company, which produced electric appliances, and started to experiment with new construction and production technologies. In 1962 Colombo opened his own interior design and architecture projects, mostly for lodges and skiing."
"Colombo designed products for Oluce, Kartell, Bieffe, Alessi, Flexform and Boffi."
Colombo died in 1971 on his 41st birthday.
"Together with his brother Gianni, Colombo developed the idea of prismatic lamps like the lamp ""Acrilica""(1962). His first design for Kartell was the chair ""No.4801"" (1963–1967) which consisted of three assembled plywood elements. The flowing elements of his chair were a foretaste of his later plastic designs, like the chair ""universale No.4860"" (1965–1967), which was the first seating for adults made of ABS."
"Moreover, Colombo produced innovative designs for furniture, lamps, glass, doorknobs, pipes, alarm clocks, and wristwatches. He created the professional camera ""Trisystem"" (1969), the air conditioner ""Candy"" (1970), dinnerware for Alitalia (1970; still in use), as well as an ergonomic and engined printing table."
"Since the beginning of his career Colombo was most interested in living systems. His early modular container ""Combi-Centre"" of 1963 is an example for that. This preference for furniture systems led to designs like ""Additional Living System"" (1967–1968) and the chairs ""Tube"" (1969–1970) and ""Multi"" (1970), which could be assembled in various positions to get a great number of sitting positions."
"In addition to the desecration of the courthouse's loose paper records, either a Union Army officer or an Indiana unit confiscated an old Scots language Bible belonging to White, which had been passed down to him from his grandfather, John White. The ""old Scots Bible"" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy."
"White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis."
"White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church, Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Bishop Minegerode of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White's funeral services."
"White's friends and family believed that he ""died of grief"" caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict. In their ""History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present"" (1897), West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White:"
"White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on December 15, 1815. Tapscott was White's cousin through his mother, Arabella Baker White. White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together:"
"White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit (March 19, 1811 – November 12, 1866), a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester, Virginia. Streit and her family were of Swiss descent. White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy):"
"White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as ""Liberty Hall"". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a ""large brick mansion"" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a ""seat of true old Virginia hospitality"" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region."
"During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence."

"In the North American version, two monsters (Dalawa Bunny and Accident Rabbit) were taken out of the game, but not out of the monsters list, making it impossible to finish the game with 100% completion. The PAL version still contains this error, and is also known to crash in certain places when played in 50 Hz mode, leaving those areas potentially impassable to players whose television does not support 60 Hz PAL signals."
Some PAL copies also have another issue where triggering specific Material summons would freeze the game. A workaround is to disable the battle movies in the game's options. This bug affects both PAL and NTSC modes.
"The English localization copy is known to freeze when loading the area at the top of a ladder at ""The Great Wall"" roughly 5 hours into the game when played in PAL mode.

"The Kichai tribe (also Keechi or Kitsai) was a Native American Southern Plains tribe that lived in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Their name for themselves was K'itaish."
"The Kichai were most closely related to the Pawnee. French explorers encountered them on the Red River in Louisiana in 1701. By 1772, they were primarily settled around the east of the Trinity River, near present-day Palestine, Texas. After forced relocation, they came to share portions of southern and southwestern Oklahoma with the Wichita and in the Muscogee Creek Nation."
"The Kichai were part of the complex, shifting political alliances of the South Plains. Early Europeans identified them as enemies of the Caddo. In 1712, they fought the Hainai along the Trinity River; however, they were allied with other member tribes of the Caddoan Confederacy and intermarried with the Kadohadacho during this time."
"On November 10, 1837, the Texas Rangers fought the Kichai in the Battle of Stone Houses. The Kichai were victorious, despite losing their leader in the first attack."
"Caddo-Wichita-Delaware lands were broken up to individual allotments in the beginning of the 20th century. Kichai people's allotted lands were mainly in Caddo County, Oklahoma. Forty-seven full-blood Kichai lived in Oklahoma in 1950. There were only four at the end of the 20th century."

= = = Darwin (programming game) = = =
"Darwin was a programming game invented in August 1961 by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.) The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there. The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an ""ultimate"" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it."
"The game consisted of a program called the ""umpire"" and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the ""arena"", into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded. The programs were written in 7090 machine code, and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves."
"The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive. The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner."
"Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as ""protected"". If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed. This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth."
"While the programs were responsible for copying and relocating themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire. As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating. Instead, the source code for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated."
"The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions. McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions. In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this."
"The ""ultimately lethal"" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy."

The pontoon bridge was disassembled and rebuilt twice a year, once to float on open water, and once to be placed on solid ice. After a 1915 initiative to build a permanent bridge faltered with the U.S. entrance into World War I, a new effort was started by the Yankton Chamber of Commerce 1919. Though fundraising problems caused a temporary halt in 1922, the new bridge, featuring a movable span to allow for river navigation, was completed during the summer of 1924."
"The dedication ceremony was held on October 11, 1924 and the bridge opened as a toll bridge. It was the last link of the Meridian Highway, which became U.S. Route 81, to be completed. It was designed for use by trains on the lower level of the bridge and vehicular traffic on the upper level; a lift mechanism allowed river traffic to pass below. However, trains never used the lower level. In 1953, all tolls were lifted and the two levels were converted to one-way traffic, northbound on the top, southbound on the bottom."
"In the 1980s, the lift mechanism and counterweights were removed, and the decorative iron railings on the upper level were replaced by Jersey barricades."
The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
"On May 9, 2008, a 10-ton gross weight limit was placed on the bridge after an inspection found corrosion on the gusset plates. It was replaced by the Discovery Bridge upon its opening on October 11, 2008, exactly 84 years after the dedication of the Meridian Highway Bridge."
"The bridge was used as location for filming a scene of the 2016 film ""Until Forever""."
"With completion of the Discovery Bridge, the Meridian Bridge has been converted into a pedestrian/bike trail. The bridge reopened in November 2011 to non-motorized traffic only. A two block-long pedestrian plaza has been added."
"The bridge spans the Missouri National Recreational River, a unit of the National Park Service created under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act."

"""Without You"" was the first duet recorded by Bryson and Belle, who recorded four songs together, and was also the first successful duet of the two. Another success the duo came in 1992 with ""A Whole New World"", the theme of the animated feature film ""Aladdin""."
"In addition to its original English version by Bryson and Belle, ""Without You"" also received two adaptations in different languages. The first was in Portuguese and the second was in Spanish, in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Both adaptations received the title ""Amor Dividido"", and were recorded by the same Brazilian singer. The adaptation in Portuguese was a success in Brazil in 1989."
"""Without You"" has no official video clip, only a video with a presentation of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle in the American musical variety television program ""Soul Train"" in 1987, presented by American television show host Don Cornelius. The video can be watched on ."
"""Without You"" was composed by Lamont Dozier to be the love theme in ""Leonard Part 6"", released in the United States on December 18, 1987, and the film starred Bill Cosby in the lead role. That same year, Regina Belle released her first album, ""All by Myself"", but ""Without You"" was not included on the album. In 2012, ""All by Myself"" was remastered on CD and ""Without You"" was included at the end of the album as a bonus track, however, it was not the original 1987 version, but a ""single mix"" of the song. ""Without You"" was not included in any of Belle's other albums, nor in her compilations. Unlike her, Bryson included the song on his album ""Positive"", released in 1988, the only album that contains the original version of ""Without You"", which was also included in his compilations ""Anthology"", released in 2001, and ""Bedroom Classics Vol. 2 – Peabo Bryson"", released in 2004. On every album that the song is present, it is titled ""Without You (Love Theme from Leonard Part 6)"", but its title is only ""Without You"". It was the first of four duets recorded by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, who recorded together ""Without You"" (in 1987), ""I Can't Imagine"" (in 1991), ""A Whole New World"" (in 1992) and ""Total Praise"" (in 2009)."
"The B-side of the original single contains the song ""The Higher You Climb"", which had been recorded by Bryson only in 1986. It was written and produced by himself, with co-production from Dwight Watkins, and released on his album ""Quiet Storm"" in the same year. It was a simple song from their album that was not released as a single."

"So we could get down to business. We divided the exhibitors in two, those who were headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On one side of the central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young painters organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other."
"In the Room 41 we were grouped together – Le Fauconnier, Léger, Delaunay, Metzinger and myself, joined, at the insistence of Guillaume Apollinaire, who was following this organisation with the greatest interest, by Marie Laurencin"
"Le Fauconnier showed his great ""Abondance"". Léger his nudes in a landscape in which volumes were treated following the method of differently shaded areas [zones dégradées] used in architecture or in mechanical models. Delaunay ""Le Tour Eiffel"" and ""La Ville"". Metzinger [Landscape, Nude, Woman's Head and Still Life], Marie Laurencin some canvasses with people in them. Myself – two landscapes and two canvasses with people: ""La Femme au phlox"" and ""Homme nu sortant du bain""."
"That, very precisely, was how Room 41 in the 1911 Indépendants was made up. In the neighbouring room were to be found, if my memory is right, Lhote, Segonzac, Moreau. [...]"
"During the few days it took for the hanging commission to do its work, there was nothing that could have enabled us to foresee the effect our pictures were about to produce on the public at large. The painters and critics who walked around the canvasses were clearly very interested, whether they were for or against. But no-one could have thought there was material there for a scandal. And we the first, who certainly never would have wanted it."
"So we were greatly surprised when, at the preview, the explosion took place. (Albert Gleizes)"
"""The great complaint that was made against us was of being unreadable; people claimed they could 'see' nothing in our pictures"". Gleizes continues:"
"Everyone was crushed into our room, people were shouting or laughing, expressing indignation, protesting, getting up to all sorts of antics, they were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and defended our position and those who condemned it argued with each other... Room 41 was always full."
"In ""Intransigeant"" Guillaume Apollinaire emphasized the importance of what the Cubists were doing and defended them with passion. Louis Vauxcelles in ""Gil Blas"" attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in ""Comoedia, Excelsior, Action"", and ""L'Oeuvre"" were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in ""Paris-Journal"", the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism."
"It was from that preview in 1911 that the term 'Cubism' can be dated. Prior to the Salon des Indépendants of 1911 no one had ever been called a Cubist, not even Braque or Picasso."
"What, by contrast, can be established is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined as it was to the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the ""Indépendants"", during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born in the same way as the word 'Impressionism' in 1872."
"Overnight, Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger and Delaunay had become famous. Virtually unknown the previous evening, their names and profiles were spread not only throughout Paris but throughout France and other countries as well. Gleizes writes:"
"Painting which, until then, had been the concern of only a small handful of amateurs, passed into the public domain and everyone wanted to be informed, to be let into the secret of those paintings which, it seemed, represented nothing, and whose meaning had to be deciphered like a puzzle."
"The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, known today as the Armory Show, was a landmark event in the history of art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries. This massive exhibition was presented in varying forms at three venues—New York (69th Regiment Armory, February 17 – March 15), Chicago (Art Institute of Chicago, March 24 – April 16), and Boston (Copley Society, April 23 – May 14). The exhibition introduced the visual language of European modernism to a wide spectrum of the American public, changing the aesthetic outlook for American artists, collectors, critics, galleries and museums."
"In 1913, Gleizes, along with Archipenko, Picabia, Picasso, the Duchamp brothers and others, introduced Cubism to an American audience at the Armory Show in three major cities, New York City, Chicago and Boston. In addition to ""La Femme aux Phlox"" Gleizes exhibited his 1912 painting ""Man on a balcony"" (no. 196 of the catalogue)."
"Gleizes entries—both of particular importance, had already produced a considerable effect in Paris—practically eclipsed six paintings and a drawing by Picasso, and three paintings by Braque exhibited at the Armory Show."

"Before construction, the people who want to Cross (call for the Tanjung Agas and Malacca) had crossed the Muar river using the ferry facility called ""Penambang"" which began operating around 1890 since Muar was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar."
"Due to the rapid development time, felt unable to cope ""Penambang"" vehicles wishing to cross the Muar River. Travel by ferry is quite time consuming and even dangerous especially during flood season. Therefore, the proposal was made to build a bridge that will connect to Tanjung Agas Muar Town and Malacca."
"Originally, the government planned to build a bridge across Sungai Batu Pahat alone. But after receiving pressure from Muar residents, the government added a proposal to build a bridge to Muar and Batu Pahat. Proposal to build two bridges that have been included in the Second Malaya Plan (1961–1966) by the Malayan Public Works Department (JKR) and it was announced by the Minister of Public Works, Tun VT Sambanthan."
The Government then open invitation to tender in 1960 and received 25 tenders from 10 firms who are interested in the two of them are from the French company based here. The government had to wait almost 4 years to get financing to build the bridge.
"Finally, in July 1964 the government announced that two local companies Wing Co. Ltd. and Development Services Ltd has won the tender of RM5.2 million for the two bridges Muar and Batu Pahat."
"Initially, the government estimated allocation of RM8 million for the construction of both the bridge and the government finally succeeded in obtaining financing proceeds of RM9 million loan from Chase Manhattan Bank."
The government has allocated RM3.25 million for construction work. The work was initiated at the end of construction in 1965 and was completed in early 1967. They are built just 1.5 kilometres from the Tangga Batu Penambang Ferry Terminal.
"The bridge over 1,264 feet (385 meters) is constructed with an area of 24 feet (7 meters) of the vehicle lanes, 8-foot (2-meter) for bike paths / bike, and 5 feet of sidewalks. It can accommodate a load of 500 tons for each 100 feet (30 meters)."
"To complete this bridge, 4 pontoons used to carry concrete mixers, cement, sand and cranes weighing up to 120 with 50 ton lift in which a total of 2 piers built specifically to fit the mould of concrete beams."
"The bridge was built on 48 piles of special steel imported from Germany and reinforced concrete piles 82. It is estimated that more than 9,000 cubic meters of concrete and 2100 tons of steel and a workforce of 130 people was used during the construction of the bridge."
"With the construction of this bridge, road users from Johor Bahru to Melaka when it has saved about 64 miles by road from Segamat–Tangkak–Jasin."
"To handle the influx of traffic due to the construction of the bridge. Four roundabouts was built at a cost of RM1 million in every locations including Jalan Yahya roundabout, Bentayan roundabout, Sulaiman roundabout and Khalidi roundabout."
"The Muar bridge was officially opened by the late Sultan of Johor, Almarhum Sultan Sir Ismail Al-Khalidi ibni Almarhum Sultan Sir Ibrahim Al-Masyhur on Saturday, 16 April 1967 at 10.30 am and was named officially as the Sultan Ismail Bridge. The inauguration was witnessed by thousands of people who first opened and crossed the Muar River to use the bridge. Following the opening of the bridge, the ""Penambang"" ferry service was terminated effective midnight Friday, 15 April 1967."
"The Sultan Ismail Bridge is the second toll bridge in Malaysia after Sultan Yahya Petra Bridge in Kelantan (opened in 1967). The RM80,000 toll plaza was built in Tanjung Agas for toll collection to cover the cost of the building of the bridge."
"Initially, the government announced that tolls are charged RM0.25 for motorbikes, RM0.75 to RM1.75 for cars and heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses."
"After opening, the price raised to RM0.50 toll for motorbikes, RM1.50 for cars and taxis and RM3.50 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses. This has invited objections from residents, particularly taxi and bus operators where at first they boycotted the use of the bridge."
"After numerous objections made mainly from traders and industrial sectors, starting 1 July 1971, the second Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak has announced a reduction to RM0.50 toll for cars and RM1.00 for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, while for motorcyclists it is free."

"The Prometheus is traveling back to Earth with a Hyperspace engine from an Al'kesh. Every couple of hours, the Prometheus has to jump out of hyperspace to cool down the Al'kesh hyperspace engine. The Prometheus comes near a nebula that Samantha Carter thinks doesn't conform to nebulae she has previously studied. When they jump out of hyperspace, the Prometheus is attacked by an unknown vessel. They can't jump into hyperspace because the engines need to cool down. The Prometheus is chased into a gas cloud by the alien ship. Samantha Carter is knocked out when she tries to convert power from auxiliary to the hyperspace engine to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud. When she wakes up, all the crew members other than her have disappeared. She alone must get herself and them to safety. She has visions of a little girl running around the ship, playing with bubbles and of her friends, who vocalize her worries and theories about her predicament. Teal'c at one point grabs Carter by the arm and warns her that if she falls asleep she will die."
"The hallucination of Daniel Jackson frankly confesses that he is unreal but he is present because there is something she has overlooked. The hallucination of Teal'c warns her that this whole scenario could be a result of the hostile alien species mind-probing, with a view to her inadvertently surrendering information about the Prometheus' engine technology. Daniel then reappears and tells her that the 'nebula' may be a living being which is why she and the alien ship are stuck inside."
"The hallucinations of Jacob Carter and of Jack O'Neill serve as a means by which Carter confronts her personal life and her relationships (in particular when talking to 'Jack', her feelings for him). 'Jack' tells her he will always be there for her, no matter what."
After an encounter with the small girl who is playing with bubbles Carter hits on a solution. She engages the hyperspace engines with only a fraction of the usual amount of power. This has the effect of rendering the ship partially intangible.
"She contacts the alien ship and offers them the solution to escaping the nebula in exchange for the return of the crew and safe passage. After a confused crew are beamed back in to the Prometheus, Carter creates a hyperspace bubble large enough to encompass both the Prometheus and the alien ship and they both exit the nebula safely. The aliens keep their end of the bargain and jet away. Carter relieves herself of duty and is escorted to the infirmary for massive concussion."

The building, noted for its unusually slanted facade, was designed by Sheldon Schlegman of A. Epstein and Sons. The building has 39 floors of tenant space and the two spires at the top cover the main roof and HVAC equipment."
"Although the building looks as though it is split down the middle, the two sides are only slightly disjointed until nearing the top, where there is a gap between them. At times, its slanted roof—which has been likened to a skyscraper slashed with a knife—displays local sports slogans on its face, such as ""GO BEARS"" and ""GO SOX"".

"Vokrug sveta (, literally: ""Around the World"") is a Russian geographic magazine. It is the longest running magazine in the Russian language. The first issue was printed in Saint Petersburg, in December 1861, almost thirty years before the establishment of the ""National Geographic Magazine"". Thus, it is one of the oldest popular science magazines in the world. Release of ""Vokrug sveta"" was suspended twice: from 1918 to 1927, during the Russian Revolution, and from 1941 to 1945, during World War II. Nevertheless, the magazine always resumed and continues to be published to this day."
"The magazine was conceived by a Warsaw-born entrepreneur, Boleslaw Wolf, who defined ""Vokrug Sveta"" as a lavishly illustrated yearly publication, dedicated to ""physical geography, natural sciences, the most recent discoveries, inventions and observations"". Its roster of authors included: Alfred Brehm, Camille Flammarion, Nikolai Przhevalsky and Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai."
"The Wolf edition was discontinued after 1868 for unclear reasons, but the project of a popular geographical journal was revived in 1885 by Ivan Sytin, a printer who directed his periodicals toward a wider audience. Sytin's ""Vokrug sveta"" was issued monthly and featured original translations of popular adventure fiction from such authors as Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle."
"The Russian Revolution brought this period of the magazine's history to an abrupt termination. Like many other periodicals of Imperial Russia, ""Vokrug sveta"" suspended publication for ten years. It was back in print under the auspices of the Young Communist League, specifically targeted toward the youth audience.

"For Soviet readers, ""Vokrug sveta"" represented a rare source of authentic, fully illustrated information about foreign cultural attractions. This is despite the insistence of Soviet officials that the magazine should cover domestic tourist attractions, rather than those situated outside the USSR. In the 1960s and 1970s, the magazine continued to grow in popularity and increased the circulation to 2,300,000 copies by 1971. A television subsidiary was also popular, particularly in the early 1990s. As of 2007, ""Vokrug sveta"" ranks third among Russia's popular monthlies, with a circulation hovering around 250,000. The free archives of past issues (starting from 1970) are available on their website."

Mehdi Chamran () is an Iranian architect and conservative politician who last held office as the chairman of City Council of Tehran.
"Chamran is the brother of Mostafa Chamran. They were both members of the ""Red Shiism"", a radical group that was founded by Mostafa in the US in 1965."
"Chamran served as the head of Iran's external intelligence. He was among those who contributed to the Iran's nuclear development program from the start. He was the chairman of the City Council of Tehran from 2003 to 2013. He received the most votes from the Tehrani electorate in three of the elections he was elected in, in 2003, 2006 and 2013."
"A major supporter of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during his mayorship, Chamran turned towards Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and his supporters during the 2006 elections, which resulted in a three-way split of the third Tehran council between the two conservative factions and reformist candidates. Comparatively, the second council only consisted of conservative members and the first council mostly of reformist members."

"On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ""Squawk on the Street"", due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit three months later).

= = = International Workers' Olympiads = = =
"International Workers' Olympiads were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by Socialist Workers' Sport International (SASI). It was an organisation supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the Olympic Games. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe. Nowadays the CSIT World Sports Games are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The ""World Sports Games"" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the CSIT. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation) is an international Multi-Sports Organization."
"The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, Henri de Baillet-Latour and Avery Brundage, were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace."
"The Lucerne Sport International (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The IOC had banned the losing side of the World War I from the 1920 Summer Olympics (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the ""enemy"" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the German town of Schreiberhau, which today is a part of Poland. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in Frankfurt am Main."
"National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement. The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games. The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families."
"International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Vienna was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, both in number of participants as well as spectators. Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad. The last Workers' Olympiad at Antwerp in 1937 was a joint event with the Red Sport International organized Spartakiads."

"On 6 October 1972, ""Algorail"" allided with the pier at Holland, Michigan loaded with a cargo of salt. The pier tore a hole in her bow, which caused the vessel to sink. The ship was refloated, repaired and put back into service. On 20 April 1999, ""Algorail"" ran aground at Green Bay, Wisconsin in the Fox River. The ship was undamaged, but attempts by two tugboats to free the ship damaged the docks at Green Bay. On 25 June 2013 she ran aground with a shipment of salt in the Saginaw River.

= = = Shriek: An Afterword = = =
"Shriek: An Afterword is a fantasy novel by American writer Jeff VanderMeer. Published in 2006, ""Shriek"" is set in the fictional city of Ambergris, a recurring setting in VanderMeer's work. The novel was written over a period of eight years, owing in part to what the author said, ""[some scenes that are] very personal."""
"Ambergris, named for ""the most secret and valued part of the whale"", is a fantastical urban milieu, explicitly modern and apparently pre-industrial (despite the presence of guns, bombs, and motor vehicles). Ambergris is characterized by grocery stores, post offices, cafés, and vendors (The ""Borges Bookstore"" bears note). The city was built over the land (and quiet protests) of the fungally-adept ""graycaps"", humanoids of uncertain disposition. The inhabitants of Ambergris enjoy a fascination with squid, and celebrate an anarchic annual Festival of the Freshwater Squid."
"""Shriek: An Afterword"" deals principally with two eponymous siblings, Janice and Duncan Shriek. Janice, an ex-society figure and art critic, narrates with great and sometimes dark flamboyance. Duncan, a historian of note, entertains twin obsessions: rival historian Mary Sabon and the mysterious graycaps. The Shrieks figure rather prominently in VanderMeer's collection of Ambergris novellas and short stories ""City of Saints and Madmen"": Duncan narrates the novella ""The Early History of Ambergris"", while Janice's art criticism figures into the World Fantasy Award-winning novella ""The Transformation of Martin Lake""."
"Reviewer of ""The Believer"" noted ""It's not clear what obsesses Jeff VanderMeer more, mushrooms or books. Both appear on almost every page of his new novel Shriek: An Afterword, in which disgraced historian Duncan Shriek seeks to uncover the mystery of a race of mushroom people with mysterious fungal plans, who lurk below the surface of the moss-covered city of Ambergris. VanderMeer's previous novels are part of a fantasy subgenre, often categorized as the New Weird. While Shriek certainly contains fantasy elements, it doesn’t fit into any strictly delineated genre. There are more ideas here than flights of fancy; VanderMeer owes more to Borges than Tolkien."""

"Jeral Jamal Stokes (born October 6, 1972) is a retired American football wide receiver. Stokes played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. A first-round selection in the 1995 NFL Draft,drafted by the San Francisco 49ers ,he played professionally for the San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots of the NFL."
"Stokes was born in San Diego, California. He attended Point Loma High School in San Diego, where he was part of a talented high school football team that included quarterback Dan White and lineman La'Roi Glover. The team was coached throughout Stokes' four years by local legend Bennie Edens."
"While attending University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Stokes played for the Bruins football team from 1991 to 1994. His breakout season came in his junior year when he was named the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year. Stokes' junior season was rewarded with a top ten finish in the balloting for that year's Heisman Trophy, being the only junior recognized. Stokes' junior season ended with unanimous All-American recognition by The Sporting News, AP, UPI, and Kodak. Stokes' senior year began as the nation's leading Heisman contender but was quickly sidetracked by a severe upper thigh contusion suffered in the season's first game. Stokes still holds UCLA school records for receiving touchdowns in a season (17 in 1993), receiving touchdowns in a career (28), receiving yards in a game (263 vs. USC in 1992) and receptions in a game (14 vs. Wisconsin, 1994 Rose Bowl), among others."
"On October 9, 2009, Stokes was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame."
"Stokes was selected with the first round (tenth overall pick) of the 1995 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, and he played for the 49ers from to . The 49ers traded up 20 spots to the No. 10 pick in the first round of the draft to select Stokes. After a slow start to his rookie season, the former Bruin ultimately netted 38 receptions for 517 yards and four touchdowns, the last of which was tossed by Jerry Rice."
"During the 1996 season, Stokes suffered a broken hand and missed most of the season, leading to the emergence of the 49ers' third round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, wide receiver Terrell Owens."
"In 1997, with Rice sidelined with a torn ACL, Stokes and Owens formed a formidable duo for quarterback Steve Young, with Stokes hauling in 58 passes for 733 yards and four touchdowns. Once Rice returned, Stokes' production did not falter as he would achieve career highs in receptions (63), yards (770) and touchdowns (eight). Stokes was also the recipient of Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spitting in his face during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in December 1997."
"Along with the rest of the team, Stokes' production dropped in 1999 as a result of Young's career-ending concussion in a Monday night game in Arizona. Football Outsiders called Stokes ""the league's least valuable receiver"" in 1999."
"The 49ers released him in 2003 and he was initially signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars before going to New England. Stokes was rarely used in the Patriots offense, only contributing 15 catches for 154 yards during the 2003 campaign. New England released him and activated fullback Larry Centers near the end of the season. However, he was re-signed by the Patriots prior to the AFC Championship Game."

He owns and runs a failing grocery store in Logan Circle, then a poor African-American section of Washington, D.C. that is becoming gentrified. He and two fellow African immigrants, all of them single, deal with feelings of isolation and nostalgia for home. Stephanos becomes involved with a white woman and her daughter, who move into a renovated house in the neighborhood."

= = = Sphinx (search engine) = = =
Sphinx is a fulltext F/OSS search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications.
"Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine (""SphinxSE"") for the MySQL family of databases."
"When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC."
"MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE."
"If Sphinx is run as a stand-alone server, it is possible to use SphinxAPI to connect an application to it. Official implementations of the API are available for PHP, Java, Perl, Ruby and Python languages. Unofficial implementations for other languages, as well as various third party plugins and modules are also available. Other data sources can be indexed via pipe in a custom XML format."
"The Sphinx search daemon supports the MySQL binary network protocol and can be accessed with the regular MySQL API and/or clients. Sphinx supports a subset of SQL known as SphinxQL. It supports standard querying of all index types with SELECT, modifying RealTime indexes with INSERT, REPLACE, and DELETE, and more."
"Sphinx can also provide a special storage engine for MariaDB and MySQL databases. This allows those MySQL, MariaDB to communicate with Sphinx's codice_1 to run queries and obtain results. Sphinx indices are treated like regular SQL tables."
"Sphinx is configured to examine a data set via its Indexer. The Indexer process creates a full-text index (a special data structure that enables quick keyword searches) from the given data/text. Full-text fields are the resulting content that is indexed by Sphinx; they can be (quickly) searched for keywords. Fields are named, and you can limit your searches to a single field (e.g. search through ""title"" only) or a subset of fields (e.g. to ""title"" and ""abstract"" only). Sphinx's index format generally supports up to 256 fields. Note that the original data is not stored in the Sphinx index, but are discarded during the Indexing process; Sphinx assumes that you store those contents elsewhere."
Attributes are additional values associated with each document that can be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search. Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive. Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is. Currently supported attribute types are:
(since 1.10-beta);
(since 2.1.1-beta);
"Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, works with a so-called fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well when most of the data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but all the distinct fields that you need for all the goods across all the categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys which may or may not be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it."

"Spilsbury, descended from Mormon settlers in Mexico, spent much of his childhood in Arizona, where his father was a football coach, first in the high school ranks and then at Arizona State Teachers College (now Northern Arizona University). After his father left Northern Arizona, the family returned to Mexico, settling in Colonia Juárez. The younger Spilsbury briefly attended Brigham Young University before moving to Hollywood to attempt to break into acting."
"Using the name Max Keller in 1979, he moved to New York City, where he did a few minor bit parts on a few daytime soaps."
"Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue in ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" was dubbed by actor James Keach. Considerable controversy surrounded Spilsbury at the time of the film's release, in part because of the studio's treatment of Clayton Moore, star of the popular 1950s TV series, who was prevented through legal action from wearing his black mask during personal appearances. Controversy also was due to Spilsbury's on-set antics, which included fighting with crew members and being uncooperative and combative during the production. It was the only film Spilsbury made. For his performance in this film, Spilsbury received the 1981 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor."
"Andy Warhol interviewed Spilsbury during his promotion tour, later describing the interview as ""nutty,"" because Spilsbury was ""blowing his whole image"" during their conversation. Spilsbury told Warhol that, before making the movie, he had been an art student married to a rich woman and that they had a baby together. He went on to state that they did not spend much time together because he needed too much time with his own thoughts, a detail that Warhol found amusing. Spilsbury told Warhol that he was a friend of actor Dennis Christopher and had fallen in love with him, and that he also had later fallen in love with actor Bud Cort. Warhol described Spilsbury as ""very drunk"" during the latter part of the interview, and the latter also mentioned that ""he'd been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston."""
"An article about him in ""The Los Angeles Times"" in 1989 revealed that he had spent some time in Europe and was working as a model. He had hopes to revive his career as an actor, but admitted in the article that he was not having much luck. He has intermittently coached acting workshops at the Herpolscheimer Academy in Vancouver."

"""Let's Go to Bed"" is a song by English rock band the Cure, released as a stand-alone single by Fiction Records in November 1982. In the aftermath of the dark ""Pornography"", Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in the Lake District to write the song, the antithesis to what the Cure currently represented. It was later included on the album ""Japanese Whispers""."
"The single was a minor success in the UK (peaking at No. 44) but was a top 20 hit in both Australia and New Zealand in 1983, reaching respectively No. 15 and No. 17."
"The origins of ""Let's Go to Bed"" lie in ""Temptation"", one of the demos for ""Pornography"". The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled ""Temptation Two"", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the ""Pornography"" album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the ""doo doo doo""s of the later song. The song version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November 1982, as a take which was very close to the final version that appeared as a single in the same month."
"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Robert Smith discussed the initial reaction when playing the song to Fiction Records: However, the song became a success much to Smith’s surprise. Later on in the same interview he said"
"On 15 March 1983, the song was the first broadcast for the pioneering Boston-based alternative rock radio station WFNX. When WFNX was sold and ceased broadcasting on 20 July 2012, ""Let's Go to Bed"" was selected as the station's final broadcast."
"AllMusic described the song as ""antic, herky-jerky new wave pop"", while ""Pitchfork"" called it ""bratty, funky synthpop""."
"The song's music video was the band's first collaboration with Tim Pope, who would go on to direct several more videos for the group. The video features members Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst, who at that point were the only members of the Cure – the only instance in the band's history where the band officially had a two-person lineup. Pope’s video treatment displayed the band’s more whimsical side, something absent from the band’s early work. In his book, Tolhurst also recalls that he was dancing naked behind the screen as a shadowy silhouette."

= = = Bishop Chatard High School = = =
"Bishop Chatard High School is a Catholic co-educational preparatory high school located in the Broad Ripple district of Indianapolis, Indiana in the United States. It is named after Bishop Silas Chatard, who was the first Bishop of Indianapolis, and oversaw the movement of the diocese from Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898."
"The increase in Indiana's Catholic population that triggered the splitting of the Indianapolis diocese in 1944 also caused an increase in the need for Catholic schools. It was clear that one high school would not be sufficient to provide for Indianapolis' massively expanding Catholic population. To this end, the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Clarence Schulte, ordered the construction of three new Catholic high schools in the city. The first of these, Bishop Chatard, would serve the north side of Indianapolis. The two other new schools, Roncalli High School and Cardinal Ritter High School, would serve the south and west sides of Indianapolis respectively. Scecina would continue to serve the east side of the city."
"Ground was broken for the first of the schools, Bishop Chatard, in the fall of 1960 on diocese property at the corner of Crittenden and Kessler Avenues. Construction of the school and an adjacent convent was completed in less than a year, and the first students were admitted in September 1961. Each year a class of students was added to the school, and the first graduating class was the class of 1964-65. Over the years, many improvements were made to the school facility as the number of students rose."
"Initially, classes were taught almost entirely by priests from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and Benedictine Sisters of Beech Grove. Many sisters were housed in the convent on-site, but their numbers declined to the point that in the 1970s, their convent was converted to an annex of the school. The annex has served as classroom, office and storage space for thirty years, and was recently rededicated to the Sisters as the St. Benedict Center."
"By 1997, the school was showing its age. Paint was peeling, windows and roofs were leaky, and facilities sorely needed an upgrade. To remedy the situation and remodel the 35-year-old building, school administrators embarked on a $2 million capital campaign to pay for new windows, a new roof, electrical improvements, and other needed renovations. These were undertaken over the summer, and when students arrived to begin the 1997-1998 school year, they were in what was virtually a whole new building."
"In 1999, improvements continued with the opening of the new fine arts addition. A new band room, art studio, and library were added, as were six new classrooms and an elevator to make the building handicap-accessible. This was paid for by a $1.5 million building drive made possible by alumni donations."
"In the summer of 2005, and completed over the 2007-08 school year, a campaign involved the construction of an additional elevator to allow better access to classrooms for handicapped students and a remodeling of the cafeteria and several hallways. A new auxiliary gymnasium was paid for by alumni donations and a slight tuition increase. In 2011, President Bill Sahm announced the “Golden Opportunities Campaign,” to address several issues including the creation of a tuition assistance endowment and a teacher compensation endowment. The Campaign also addressed improvements to the academic environment including the addition of robust wireless network throughout the two buildings, new servers and expanded student and teacher access to 21st century computers in the classrooms and labs. The Campaign also addressed the needs of the athletic community with the addition of a competition track and fields including a new turf field and all-weather track with bleacher seating for 900, stadium lighting and a concession/restroom facility, as well as a turf baseball field and a one-mile walk/run trail."

= = = Govenlock = = =
"Govenlock is an unincorporated community within Rural Municipality of Reno No. 51, Saskatchewan, Canada. Previously held the status of a village with a peak population of 151 residents, until its village status was dissolved on January 1, 1976. The former townsite of Govenlock is located on Highway 21 & Highway 13 also known as the historic Red Coat Trail, about 15 km east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Very little remains of the former village of Govenlock, many cement foundations and wooden sidewalks can still be found scattered around the town site, the only building that still stands as of 2010 is the old community hall and a commemorative plaque in remembrance of Govenlock's rich history."
"Govenlock, like so many other small communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a completely abandoned ""ghost town"" with a population of 0 citizens. Prior to January 1, 1976, Govenlock was incorporated under village status, but was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date."
"In 2006, Govenlock had a population of 0 living in 0 dwellings, a 0% increase from 2001. The community had a land area of and a population density of ."
"In 1910, a Moose Jaw resident by the name of William Govenlock moved to the area with his family after applying for a homestead. They were one of the first pioneer families of Southwest Saskatchewan. In 1913, William negotiated a land deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway, starting a new town later named in his honour. That same year William established a post office for the area, with his wife Bessie as the first postmaster."
"In 1914 a pioneer named John Linder built Govenlock's first Hotel. The hotel stood two stories tall with ten rooms. Three years later a man named James Gaff stopped at the Hotel for a rest; after finding out that no rooms were available James immediately purchased the hotel for $4,500."
"Even though the liquor trade was big business during that time, Govenlock's future looked promising even without the steady stream of liquor. The town boasted its impressive CPR station, section house, a few grain elevators, two general stores, blacksmith shops, a livery barn, two machine agencies, pool room, laundromat, school, meat shop, a service station selling Model T Fords, and a hotel. Most of these businesses were connected by wooden sidewalks, a common feature in the pioneer prairie days."
"After Montana's prohibition declaration in 1919, large groups of Americans from that state frequently crossed the border by train to visit Govenlock to purchase booze."
"Indicating that Govenlock had a promising future, the pioneer town had a chamber of commerce. It was the liquor trade that fuelled Govenlock's prosperity. Four liquor warehouses were established in the centre to serve a booming liquor trade. With liquor trade and the frequent influx of imbibers, gambling and parties became common, attracting not only thirsty folks from across the border, but many bachelors from all parts of Southwestern Saskatchewan who wanted to let loose."
"Over the years a poolroom and two-story dancehall building was built and owned by Henry Buss. During the early days, Govenlock was a place for people of both countries to socialize and relax. As the American booze customers waited for their liquor orders, many would mingle with the people of Govenlock and settle down for a game of pool or a game of high-stakes poker. Revelry and good times were staples in Govenlock during their early days."
"Busy American booze traders were also a staple in Govenlock. To avoid legal problems, bootleggers would have to obtain a tourist pass at Canada border entry points. They would come to the pioneer town in their Fords, Studebakers, Packards, and Hudsons. The empty cars' rears were filled with sand bags until they filled up at the liquor houses. This was done to avoid suspicion when they rode empty of booze, light without a load. Canadian beer cost 12 cents per bottle and was said to be highly prized. Whiskey was more expensive and more lucrative. It was transported in barrels. Each barrel had three burlap sacks, with 24 four-quart bottles - wrapped in straw - in each sack. A barrel wholesaled for $24. When it reached the United States, it sold for $140. A carload of 14 barrels of beer and five cases of whiskey could fetch a profit of $2,500."
"The bootlegging trade was good business for several years and there were few legal hassles for the rumrunners. Mounties and provincial police intervened to ensure that the liquor went through the hands of locals before crossing the United States border. Even a few of the Govenlock residents tried their hand at bootlegging, but they soon found out that more of the liquor was stolen than they sold."
"When 1922 rolled around, so did the end of bootlegging that fueled Govenlock's prosperity. It was then that the Government of Saskatchewan announced it wanted better control of the liquor trade and restricted liquor export houses to cities with 10,000 people or more. This started the slow end of the once promising pioneer town of Govenlock. Over the years and one by one, stores and shops soon closed and residents left. In 1962 the only grain elevator left in Govenlock was toppled and demolished. By 1990, rural municipality officials brought in the bulldozers and demolished all but one of the remaining buildings that stood in Govenlock, including the old Govenlock Hotel."
"The only building left is the community hall, built in 1948. Also a commemorative plaque marks the area where Govenlock was located. It honors Govenlock's wild past and wild spirit of its hell-raising pioneer days."

"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (), also commonly referred to as ""the farm bill,"" is one of two United States ""farm bills"" that were introduced in the 113th United States Congress. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is the bill that was introduced into the United States Senate. A second bill, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 () was introduced into the United States House of Representatives. The two bills cover similar topics and programs, but have significantly different provisions. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 passed the Senate on June 10, 2013 and has received the support of the President."
"However, the Senate bill failed to pass in the House, so the two chambers organized a conference committee. The result is the Agriculture Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642; 113th Congress), which passed the House on January 29, 2014. The Agriculture Act of 2014 includes provisions from both the House and the Senate bills."
"One of the major provisions of the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is a $4 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a controversial provision, with some Democrats arguing that the cuts were too large, while some Republicans arguing that the cuts did not do enough to cut the deficit."
"A ""farm bill"" is one of the primary tools of the United States federal government to set policy related to agriculture in the United States. Farm bills are passed roughly every five years. The farm bills typically cover laws and policies related to supplemental nutrition, land payments, crop insurance, environmental practices, some international trade, and research."
"A similar bill to the proposed Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was also passed by the Senate in the 112th United States Congress, but never received much attention in the House and failed to become law. The current ""farm bill"" expires on September 30, 2013."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would cut spending $24 billion over 10 years. Overall, however, it would still cost nearly $955 billion over 10 years."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would reduce spending on food stamps by $4 billion over 10 years."
"""This summary is based largely on the report on S. 954, as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on May 14, 2013, written by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source."""
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that direct spending stemming from the program authorization in S. 954 would total $955 billion over the 2014-2023 period. That 10-year total reflects the bill’s authorization of expiring programs through 2018 and an extension of those authorizations through 2023, consistent with the rules governing baseline projections that are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
"Relative to spending projected under CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO estimates that enacting the bill would reduce direct spending by $17.8 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""The estimated budgetary effects of S. 954 are summarized in Table 1."" CBO estimates that section 10012 of the bill would increase revenues by $54 million over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of the changes in direct spending and revenues are displayed in Table 2."""
"Assuming appropriation of the specified and necessary amounts, the CBO also estimates that implementing the bill would cost $30.1 billion over the 2014-2018 period and $39.9 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of that estimate are displayed in Table 3."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). In general, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit from the continuation of existing agricultural assistance and the creation of new grant programs."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, by expanding reporting requirements on manufacturers of dairy products and establishing regulations for dairy handlers that purchase milk from dairy producers participating in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. Additionally, the bill would prohibit individuals from attending animal fighting ventures in states and U.S. territories that permit such ventures. Because the compliance cost for dairy handlers would depend on future regulations, the CBO has no basis to determine whether the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation)."
"The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. Enacting S. 954 would affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. ""The net change in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 4."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was introduced into the Senate on May 14, 2013 by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The bill was considered on the Senate floor on May 21–23, and June 3–4, June 6, and June 10, 2013. On June 10, 2013, the bill passed in the Senate in Recorded Vote 145: 66-27. Only two Democrats voted against their party: Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). Eighteen Republicans voted in favor of the bill."
"As of June 24, 2013, the United States House of Representatives had not considered the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 or added it to a calendar. On June 20, 2013, Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) urged the House to take up consideration of the bill, speaking from the Senate floor. The Senator argued that because the Senate bill had received the support of many Republicans and cut spending, the House should have no objections to passing it as well. The bill was not put on the Majority Leader's calendar for the week of June 24."

"Elizabeth of Carinthia (also known as Elizabeth of Tyrol; – 28 October 1312), was a Duchess of Austria from 1282 and Queen of Germany from 1298 until 1308, by marriage to the Habsburg king Albert I."
"Born in Munich, Bavaria, she was the eldest daughter of Count Meinhard of Gorizia-Tyrol, and Elizabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany, widow of the late Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany."
"Elizabeth thus was a half-sister of Conradin, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia. Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes, Austria's important neighbors."
"She was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected King Rudolf I of Germany, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor-to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282."
"Albert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg ""hereditary lands"", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286."
"Elizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion."
"Upon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of Göllheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg."
"On 1 May 1308 her husband was murdered by his nephew John ""the Parricide"" near Windisch, Swabia (in modern-day Switzerland). After Albert's assassination, Elizabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of Königsfelden erected at the site, where she died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried. Today her mortal remains rest at Saint Paul's Abbey in Carinthia."

Before his NFL career, he played for Winston-Salem State University, where he also played collegiate basketball."
"Thigpen played infrequently in his first three seasons, but had a breakout year in 1994, catching 36 passes for 546 yards. Then in 1995, he made the Pro Bowl, catching 85 passes for 1,307 yards and five touchdowns, and assisting his team to Super Bowl XXX, where he recorded three catches for 19 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers 27–17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. His tough style of play earned him the nickname ""Meatball,"" which was later changed to ""Phil"" when he joined the Oilers in 1998."
"Thigpen played only six games in the following season due to injuries, but made a full recovery in the 1997 season, catching 79 passes for 1,398 yards and 7 touchdowns and making his second Pro Bowl selection."
"In 1998, he signed a five-year, $21 million contract with the Oilers, which at the time was the highest known contract ever signed among wide receivers. He went on to play with them for the final three seasons of his career, assisting the team (now known as the Titans) to Super Bowl XXXIV in the 1999 season. Such a large contract for a wide receiver was a signal of the role which wide receivers would begin to play in the NFL. Thigpen retired after the 2000 season with 313 career receptions for 5,081 yards and 30 touchdowns.

For Miles & More Credit Card (Visa or MasterCard) holders issued in several countries, miles have no expiration date as long as the card is held and/or used. If the credit card contract is ended, the original expiry date of the miles is reinstated; although the earliest miles can expire is at the end of the quarter after the credit card contract is ended."
"Status miles can only be earned when flying on the fully integrated partner airlines or on Star Alliance members. There is no other way to earn these miles. In addition, status miles expire at the end of each calendar year. They are used to identify the frequent flyers and members that are able to qualify for a higher status on the basis of the status miles that they have collected in one year."
"Select benefits are advantages that can be earned in addition to the status benefits, as part of the programme called Miles & More Selections while the status is still valid. Once the member has reached specified mileage levels by flying, additional advantages can be selected. With every mileage level reached the range of select benefits increases. The selection of the select benefits varies from the status the member has. The select benefits for Frequent Travellers e.g. include business lounge vouchers, e-vouchers or mile exchange, the ones for Senators a Hilton Gold Membership, in addition. For HON circle members additional benefits such as coupons up to a value of 100 Euro as well as additional Senator partner cards are available."
"HON Circle miles can only be earned when flying in business or first class on the fully integrated partner airlines and Air-Rail trains in Germany (up to a total of 600,000 miles within two consecutive calendar years). They are necessary to attain the top-tier status on Miles & More – HON Circle. Until April 1, 2006 it was possible to also collect this type of mile on United Airlines. This option no longer exists. HON-miles have to be accumulated within two calendar years. Only Senators with an account balance of more than 300,000 status miles over two years, and existing HON Circle members, can see these miles on their account statement. HON Circle qualifying miles balance is also visible to Frequent Traveller and Senator members when logged in their Lufthansa iPad or Android app."
"The miles that a member receives after having completed a flight depend on the Airline issuing ticket, mileage flown, the class of service and the booking class."
"Tables show the number of miles earned with Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and SWISS. The number of miles earned with other airlines can be calculated using the Mileage Calculator available at the Miles & More website."
"These mileages apply for flights operated by Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and SWISS. There is the possibility to earn 10,000 miles on all flights operated by the Lufthansa Private Jet."
"Lufthansa always has a number of promotions, most lasting for 1–2 months only. They include double mileage on new routes, extra miles for using electronic check-in and alike. Some of the promotions are restricted to residents of certain countries and others are restricted to certain customers."
"Rolling Thunder used skid brakes to stop the trains rather than modern fin brakes. The trains had brake pads underneath each car which slid against the brakes to lift the train's wheels off the track. The brakes were always in the up position unless the operator, in conjunction with the rear unloader attendant, advanced a train. The road wheels were heard spinning at the end of the ride and continued to spin until the operator, in conjunction with the unload attendant, advanced the train."
"There were three sets of brakes. The trim and ready brakes were located in the tunnel at the end of the ride. The trim brake slowed and stopped the train and served as a holding place for one train until the second train left the station. The train was advanced off the trim and onto the ready brake. The ready brake held the train until the second train reached the top half of the lift hill. The Dispatch brake held the train in the station while it was being unloaded and loaded for the next ride. The trains were stopped manually and were not always aligned with the queue stalls in the station. Therefore, the attendants had to direct the guests to their rows from time to time before the airgates were opened."
"When the brake pads and wheels got wet, there was little friction to stop the trains and they slid too far onto the brakes. For safety reasons, only one train ran per side in rainy weather."
"There were four trains that were distinguishable by color: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. Each train had four three-bench Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters cars held together by hitch bars. Each car contained six seats. Each train held a maximum of 24 riders."
The trains used buzz bars that locked in one position. Seat dividers and headrests were added in 1981 to prevent people from standing on the ride while it was in operation. Seat belts were added on the ride's 30th anniversary.
There were three types of wheels used on the trains. Sixteen road wheels rode on the steel layer on top of the track. Sixteen guide wheels guided the trains around the turned on a separate steel track located on the sides of the wooden track. Sixteen upstop wheels rode on the bottom of the track.
"On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from Middletown, NJ fell from the coaster to his death during a routine test run. An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that the man may not have secured himself with the safety bar. A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee ""may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints."" The ride was inspected, and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was ""operationally and mechanically sound."""

= = = Nurturant parent model = = =
"The nurturant parent model also ""Nurturing Parent"" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system. In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive ."
"The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on parenting style. The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both ""roots in the ground and wings to fly."" He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings). The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence. As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges."
"At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground through managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally."
"The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.'"
Other ideas:
"This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in Human Development where researchers were investigating the parenting style preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the authoritative style. The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called ""the nurturing parent"" that focuses on responsibility, empathy, and creativity. The basic approach these parents used was to:"
"Herbert Jay Rosenfield (LCSW) in his unfinished book ""Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting"" encourages use of the acronym ""RECEPEE"", for ""Reasonable Expectations, Clearly Expressed, Performed Everyday and by Example"". ""The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!"" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym ""UCARE"":"
"Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that ""parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment""."
"The nurturant parent model is also discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics"" and ""Whose Freedom?"" In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the strict father model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then progressive politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance."
"The model is also consistent with slow parenting in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely."
= = = Truncated great dodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the truncated great dodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is given a Schläfli symbol t{5,5/2}."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with three other uniform polyhedra: the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron, the great dodecicosidodecahedron, and the great rhombidodecahedron; and with the uniform compounds of 6 or 12 pentagonal prisms."
This polyhedron is the truncation of the great dodecahedron:
"The truncated small stellated dodecahedron looks like a dodecahedron on the surface, but it has 24 faces, 12 pentagons from the truncated vertices and 12 overlapping as (truncated pentagrams)."
"There are no EVEX-prefixed versions of the blend instructions from SSE4; instead, AVX-512 has a new set of blending instructions using mask registers as selectors. Together with the general compare into mask instructions below, these may be used to implement generic ternary operations or cmov, similar to XOP's VPCMOV."
"Since blending is an integral part of the EVEX encoding, these instruction may also be considered basic move instructions. Using the zeroing blend mode, they can also be used as masking instructions."
"AVX-512F has four new compare instructions. Like their XOP counterparts they use the immediate field to select between 8 different comparisons. Unlike their XOP inspiration, however, they save the result to a mask register and initially only support doubleword and quadword comparisons. The AVX-512BW extension provides the byte and word versions. Note that two mask registers may be specified for the instructions, one to write to and one to declare regular masking."
"The final way to set masks is using Logical Set Mask. These instructions perform either AND or NAND, and then set the destination opmask based on the result values being zero or non-zero. Note that like the comparison instructions, these take two opmask registers, one as destination and one a regular opmask."
"The compress and expand instructions match the APL operations of the same name. They use the opmask in a slightly different way from other AVX-512 instructions. Compress only saves the values marked in the mask, but saves them compacted by skipping and not reserving space for unmarked values. Expand operates in the opposite way, by loading as many values as indicated in the mask and then spreading them to the selected positions."
"A new set of permute instructions have been added for full two input permutations. They all take three arguments, two source registers and one index; the result is output by either overwriting the first source register or the index register. AVX-512BW extends the instructions to also include 16-bit (word) versions, and the AVX-512_VBMI extension defines the byte versions of the instructions."
"Two new instructions added can logically implement all possible bitwise operations between three inputs. They take three registers as input and an 8-bit immediate field. Each bit in the output is generated using a lookup of the three corresponding bits in the inputs to select one of the 8 positions in the 8-bit immediate. Since only 8 combinations are possible using three bits, this allow all possible 3 input bitwise operations to be performed."
"These are the only bitwise vector instructions in AVX-512F; EVEX versions of the two source SSE and AVX bitwise vector instructions AND, ANDN, OR and XOR were added in AVX-512DQ."
The difference in the doubleword and quadword versions is only the application of the opmask.
Truth table:
A number of conversion or move instructions were added; these complete the set of conversion instructions available from SSE2.
"Among the unique new features in AVX-512F are instructions to decompose floating-point values and handle special floating-point values. Since these methods are completely new, they also exist in scalar versions."
"This is the second set of new floating-point methods, which includes new scaling and approximate calculation of reciprocal, and reciprocal of square root. The approximate reciprocal instructions guarantee to have at most a relative error of 2."
The instructions in AVX-512 conflict detection (AVX-512CD) are designed to help efficiently calculate conflict-free subsets of elements in loops that normally could not be safely vectorized.
AVX-512 exponential and reciprocal instructions contain more accurate approximate reciprocal instructions than those in the AVX-512 foundation; relative error is at most 2. They also contain two new exponential functions that have a relative error of at most 2.
AVX-512 prefetch instructions contain new prefetch operations for the new scatter and gather functionality introduced in AVX2 and AVX-512. codice_1 prefetch means prefetching into level 1 cache and codice_2 means prefetching into level 2 cache.
"AVX-512DQ adds new doubleword and quadword instructions. AVX-512BW adds byte and words versions of the same instructions, and adds byte and word version of doubleword/quadword instructions in AVX-512F. A few instructions which get only word forms with AVX-512BW acquire byte forms with the AVX-512_VBMI extension (codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6)."
"Two new instructions were added to the mask instructions set: codice_7 and codice_8 (B and W forms with AVX-512DQ, D and Q with AVX-512BW). The rest of mask instructions, which had only word forms, got byte forms with AVX-512DQ and doubleword/quadword forms with AVX-512BW. codice_9 was extended to codice_10 and codice_11 by AVX-512BW."
"Among the instructions added by AVX-512DQ are several SSE, AVX instruction that didn't get AVX-512 versions with AVX-512F, among those are all the two input bitwise instructions and extract/insert integer instructions."
Instructions that are completely new are covered below.
Three new floating point operations are introduced. Since they are not only new to AVX-512 they have both packed/SIMD and scalar versions.
"The codice_12 instructions tests if the floating point value is one of eight special floating-point values, which of the eight values will trigger a bit in the output mask register is controlled by the immediate field. The codice_13 instructions perform minimum or maximum operations depending on the value of the immediate field, which can also control if the operation is done absolute or not and separately how the sign is handled. The codice_14 instructions operate on a single source, and subtract from that the integer part of the source value plus a number of bits specified in the immediate field of its fraction."

EVEX-encoded Galois field new instructions:
"VPCLMULQDQ with AVX-512F adds EVEX-encoded 512-bit version of PCLMULQDQ instruction. With AVX-512VL, it adds EVEX-encoded 256- and 128-bit versions. VPCLMULQDQ alone (that is, on non-AVX512 CPUs) adds only VEX-encoded 256-bit version. (Availability of the VEX-encoded 128-bit version is indicated by different CPUID bits: PCLMULQDQ and AVX.) The wider than 128-bit variations of the instruction perform the same operation on each 128-bit portion of input registers, but they do not extend it to select quadwords from different 128-bit fields (the meaning of imm8 operand is the same: either low or high quadword of the 128-bit field is selected)."
